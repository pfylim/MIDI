Rhythm Of My Heart  (Rod Stewart)

Across the street the river runs,
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away,
Let me still exist in another place,
Running undercover of a helicopter blade.

The flames are getting higher in effigy,
Burning down the bridges of my memory,
I can love may still be alive,
Somewhere, some way where they're,
Downing only dear a hundred steel towns away.
Oh the all over you babe, oh baby.

Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum,
With the words I love you rolling off my tongue.
No never will I roam for I know my place is home,
Where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing.

Photograps, kerosene light up my darkness,
Light it up, light it up.
I Can still feel the touch of your thin blou jeans
Running down the alley I've got my eyes.

Oh I've got lighting in my veins,
Tripping like a handle of a slot machine.
Love may still exist in another place,
I'm just yanking back the handle, 
No expression on my face.
