Une Nuit Sur Le Mont Chauve
(A Night On Bald Mountain)
Composed by M. Moussorgsky
Insturmented by N. Rimsky-Korsakov
Sequenced by Rashad Chichakly

	I have sequenced Night On Bald Mountain with Cakewalk Professional 
for Windows. I used a Roland U-20 for the srings and Pizzicato tracks and a 
Roland SoundCanvas for everything else. I suggest, if possible, the same 
setup, since putting everything on one module will probably cause clipping. 
There can get up to 40 voices simultaneously!

	If you enjoy this work and would like to hear more, or just would 
like to drop a comment or critisism, I would love to hear from you! You can 
reach me at GEnie as Y.HIVITS, COMPUServe as 70523,2516 or Delphi as Yasha.

	Enjoy!!
