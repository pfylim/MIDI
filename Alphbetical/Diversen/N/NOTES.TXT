Sergeii Prokofiev, Piano Concerto #2, Fourth movement

Original MIDI file by Gary Goldberg, National Capital Amiga Users Group

Adapted for Roland Sound Canvas, March 1993, Bob Pomicter

NOTES:

      I first downloaded this file by Gary Goldberg about two months ago
and being that this composition is my absolute favorite piano concerto,
I set out to work on conversion for the Roland Sound Canvas line in my
home setup. 

      Gary's original file was for two synths (I believe one was a
Proteus), so to convert over to GS took some planning. Aside from the
obvious repatching, GS percussion conversion, etc. I had to merge certain
tracks together in order to "squeeze it all up" into the 16 channel
GS Sound canvas.

      Additionally, the included Sysex file was created to blend things
together a bit better (I'm still not happy with the wind sounds on the
canvas, which are a bit harsh). 

      A new tempo map and velocity adjustments were made for what I
guess you'd call my "conducting" of the piece.

      Many thanks to Gary for permission to adapt this original sequence
for the Roland Sound Canvas line!


Hope you enjoy!

Bob Pomicter
