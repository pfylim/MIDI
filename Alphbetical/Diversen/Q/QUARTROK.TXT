These .MID files were written and played by Doug Tann.  They were
played in real time using as little quantization as possible.  One
of the goals of S.L.C. Midi Productions is to provide songwriters
with real sounding tracks at a fraction of the cost.  If you feel
this is something you want to use Please feel free to contact the

These patterns are made to corresponde to standard Roland Midi note 
number assignments.  Should you not know these please see the file
entitled Note.No.  Should you require custom note number assignments
