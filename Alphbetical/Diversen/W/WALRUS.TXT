"I Am The Walrus" - complete! - Sequenced by Michael Budash  73760,765This is a painstakingly sequenced version of the Beatles' classic (with not a little help from George Martin). In order to get the most pleasure out of this file, you should do the following to set up your Sound Canvas (see your S.C. manual for help):1)  Reset the unit to the GS Standard2)  Change channel ("part") 9's Part Mode to Drum1. This is VERY important, as I have two drum parts just to get the right sound (darn, that Ringo was good!). If you don't do this, you'll hear is a weird repetitive piano riff...3)  Optionally, set the Chorus type to Chorus4 (it helps the piano in particular)There are tons of controller messages, so if you must change something, better do it to a copy.Here are the channel assignments:1   - Strings2   - Bass3   - More strings4   - Contrabasses5   - Electric piano (anyone with a new Proteus Classic Keyboard module should use the Wurlitzer patch thru some kind of Leslie simulator - cool!)6   - French Horns7   - not used8   - not used9   - Kick and 1st snare10 - 2nd snare and rest of drum kitEnjoy, and please, drop me a line and let me know if you like it - besides I love mail.
