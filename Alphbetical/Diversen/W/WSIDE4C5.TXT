Realization/Orchestration
-------------------------

This sequence has been written specifically for the Roland Sound Canvas
(SCC-1, SCC-55, etc.) As such, it contains many program changes, sys-ex
messages (controllers, etc.) that take advantage of the SCC's 24 note
polyphony. Other soundcards/synths may choke-up on the demands made
of available polyphony. Both excerpts were realized for an electronic
orchestra, created from a piano reduction and using the DGG recording
for orchestration tips. "Maria" has be re-arranged for a 12-part
string orchestra. Hope you enjoy!


Adaptation for other Synths
---------------------------

Demand for polyphony is high in this sequence. A minimum of 16 voices
is recommended. Should it become necessary to delete tracks, do so
with caution. In "Maria", in particular, there is extensive "hocketing"
of strings lines for stereo ensemble effect. The trick to reducing the
sequence is to find parts that are "doubled" in the tracks.. but use
caution! What may be a doubled part for 8 measures may not be a doubled
part for the next 12 measures! The techniques makes for a nasty job
in adaptation for other synths, but the effect is well worth it on the
Sound Canvas.

Program Patches Used
--------------------

WSIDE4C5 uses the following orchestration: (note that program numbers are
given as they appear in the SEQUENCE. Actual instrument numbers are
one higher on the Canvas.)

0 - Acoustic Piano         47- Timpani            88- Fantasia
11- Vibraphone             48- Strings            99- Atmosphere
12- Marimba                49- Slow Strings      103- Star Theme
40- Violin                 50- Synth Strings I
45- Pizzicato Strings      68- Oboe

Additionally, the following GS Percussion (Channel 10) is used:

Note # 39- Castanets             Note # 54- Tambourine
Note # 57- Concert Cymbal 1      Note # 76- Woodblock
Note # 59- Concert Cymbal 2      Note # 81- Triangle

GS Owners REQUIRE a PROGRAM NUMBER of 48 on Channel 10
to put the Canvas into the "Orchestral Drum Set" Mode.
Other sound card owners should delete this.


Finding the Program Changes
---------------------------

All program changes, out of necessity, are imbedded in the MIDI lines
of each track. Note that in most cases TWO tracks are assigned to each
CHANNEL. (For hocketing). Duplication of consecutive program numbers may
seem unnecessary, but due to this technique, are REQUIRED. To adapt another
synth for this sequence, I would suggest you first find the appropriate
substitute instruments for those mentioned above. Then, systematically,
change the necessary program patches using the chart below:

TRACK#	CHANNEL#	BAR#	PATCH#
1	1		33	48	
2	1		5	12
2	1		22	11	
2	1		72	49
2	1		73	48
3	2		5	45
3	2		72	49	
4	2		no program patches
5	3		19	0
5	3		80	49
6	3		no program patches
7	4		19	50
7	4		33	48
7	4		48	48
7	4		50	45
7	4		52	45	
7	4		78	88
8	5		5	99
8	5		79	40
9	5		5	99
9	5		56	103
10	6		1	88
10	6		11	88
10	6		22	88
11	6		5	103
11	6		13	103
12	7		22	68
12	7		64	47
13	-		unused
14	8		19	48
14	8		55	48
15	8		25	49
16	9		33	48
17	9		33	48


Additional Considerations
-------------------------

Reverb settings should be raised (around 70-80 on the Sound Canvas) to
provide more depth. The file ECHO.SCD, included, may be used to make
these adjustments via Jeff Cazel's SONGCANVAS Shareware. (Version 1.2
or higher is required). If you own V1.0 of SongCanvas, you may use the
older format ECHO.CVS file from the WSIDE1.ZIP, previously uploaded.

Hope that you enjoy the sequence!
