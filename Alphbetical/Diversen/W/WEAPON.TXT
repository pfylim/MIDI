                        From the album "Signals"

This is Part II of "Fear". I sequenced this straight out of the book "RUSH
Complete". I left out the solo section due to time constraints, but will
eventually finish this up. I'm working on Parts I and III also. I will
upload these as soon as possible. Feel free (Please) to work on the solo 
section and contribute it. Enjoy.

        P.S. - Responses [good, bad and ugly] are appreciated and considered
                for their individual merits and demerits(?)!!

        Caio for now,
