ORCHESTRATION/REALIZATION for the Sound Canvas
----------------------------------------------

Working from the vocal score/piano reduction, there was no official
orchestration given, however, a reasonable "synth" orchestra was
developed based on repeated listenings of the DGG recording. There are,
however, certain liberties which I have taken to assure a better
balance of the "electronic" orchestra, (e.g. "clarinet" parts do not
make use of the GS's brash clarinet sound). The following guidelines
may be used to approximate the GS orchestration on other synths:
Please not that instrument sounds appear as part numbers showing on the
GS module. They are consistently 1 patch no. less in the sequence.

Additional Considerations:

Included in this zip file is a bank called ECHO.SCD for use with Jeff
Cazel's SONGCANVAS 1.2 Editor/Librarian. While not necessary to use it, owners
of the SongCanvas should load and transmit the sys-ex. messages within
this bank. Alternately, users may manually change the Reverb settings to
HALL 2 and about a value of 74 for depth, send and feedback for a nicer
and less intimate "orchestral" feel. 

Enjoy!
Bob

PS. PLEASE do not distribute the .MID file of this sequence without
