  As you all know Roland's GS format places instruments with similar sounds in
the same address spaces. This piece was composed using Roland's SCC-1 sound-
board. Some of the sounds that were used may not be exactly the same on all
of the GS modules therefore I am including a list of instruments with a brief
description of each where I feel the need. I have also included a sysx file
that was created using the SongCanvas by Jeff Cazel. Load this into your
module BEFORE you play the song, it sets up channel 16 with a multi-patch
for the synth-lead part. 
  I use Cakewalk by Twelve Tone Systems as my sequencer and I have also 
included the .WRK file for your viewing pleasure. If anyone cares to build on 
this file please do so and let me know when you upload it so that I can take 
a listen. Why? Because it just might be interesting!!! I can be reached 
through E-mail, [71552,2312], for comments questions or input. Please feel
free to distribute these files among your friends.

                               Thanx for listening,
                                                   Paul
