This work is JONATHAN'S RAG, an original composiution by
Charlie Kreitzberg.  There is created a standard MIDI (.MID) file and a 
a Cakewalk (.WRK) file.

The arrangement does not require any unusual instruments and
should be easily ported to any synth.  I used a Proteus/2,
Alesis D4 (percussion) and Yamaha pf85 (Piano).

If you enjoy this rag, you might also want to look at SYNTHRAG.ZIP, 
HAWKINS.ZIP and LEVI.ZIP in the library.

I look forward to your comments on the MIDI forum or by
