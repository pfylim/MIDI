This song is "Axel F" by Glenn Frey.  It is often known as the theme to the
movie "Beverly Hills Cop."  I created this version for the Roland MT-32 with
the Ballade 2.5 composer, although it sounds better on the LAPC-1 or the
CM-32L.  I didn't use sheet music or anything to enter the notes.  I just
figured it out by ear (thanks to Scott Benson for the tape).  I have included
both Ballade 2.x and standard type 1 MIDI file formats, although there aren't
any major differences between these versions.  Since Ballade uses an intricate
table of contents system to manage files, you must use one of 2 methods to load
the song.  First, if your version of Ballade comes with a program called
MAKECONT.EXE, then you can use it to rebuild one of your directories and add
the song to the table of contents.  If you do this, make sure the song file is
in the directory you want to rebuild first.  Second, if you don't have this
program, then you must go to the files section within Ballade and save any song
under the name "Axel F".  Once you have saved a song under this name, exit to
DOS.  A file named AXELF__0.SNG should have been created.  Replace this file
with the file of the same name that I have included.
