
  These are three 19th Century American Christmas Carols in their original arrangements.  These are three of some 59 American Songs which I have sequenced for GS Equipment.  I had uploaded these files as two collections in the Midi File Library.  If you like these you can check out the rest.

  The files included are:  Adesti Fideles
                           Jingle Bells
                           Oh, Christmas Tree (Maryland, My Maryland)

  The version of Jingle Bells is the original as published by James Pierpont.  The popularity of the song has led to a more simplified chorus over the years.  Mr. Pierpont is buried in my home town of Savannah, GA in our Larel Grove Cemetary, contrary to what many literary sources say about his burial site.

Hope you enjoy,  Merry Christmas.
