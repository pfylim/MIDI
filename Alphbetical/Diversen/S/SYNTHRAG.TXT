This work is the SYNTHETIC RAG, an original composiution by
Charlie Kreitzberg.  This is created as a standard MIDI (.MID) file.  
A Cakewalk version is available in this library under synthrag.exe

The arrangement does not require any unusual instruments and
should be easily ported to any synth.  I used a Proteus/2,
Alesis D4 (percussion) and Yamaha pf85 (Piano).

If you enjoy this rag, you might also want to look at HAWKINS.ZIP
and LEVI.ZIP in the library.

I look forward to your comments on the MIDI forum or by
