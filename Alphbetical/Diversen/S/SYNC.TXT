Leroy Anderson's "Syncopated Clock", arranged for string orchestra. This sequence was 
created using Finale 2.0.1 with simple note entry from sheet music, voiced for the
Roland Sound Canvas. It was created for a slide presention last October for some friends
of mine who were leaving for England. I think that I ironed out all the rough edges.

Enjoy.
