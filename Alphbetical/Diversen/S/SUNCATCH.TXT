                              Lyrics:

              Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
              The night's the time for all your tears
              Your heart may be broken tonight
              But tomorrow with the morning light
              Don't let the sun catch you cryin'

              The nighttime shadows disappear
              And with them go all your tears
              Cuz the morning will bring joy for every girl and boy
              So, don't let the sun catch you cryin'

              We know that cryin's not a bad thing
              But stop your cryin' when the birds sing
              It may be hard to discover
              That you've been left for another
              But don't forget that love's the game
              That can always come again
              So don't let the sun catch you cryin'

              Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
              Don't let the sun catch you cryin'
              Don't let the sun catch you cryin' 
              Oh, no
