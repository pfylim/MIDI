Being a novice on midi, I finally finished my first song

I used a Roland U-20 keyboard with Voyetra's Sequencer plus 
working on an IBM PC.
Using the part-play-mode, I was able to playback all channels
at the same time.

If there is any midi specialist also using the Roland U-20,                                                              
he should contact me. I have some serious troubles with the
U-20 and the sequencer.

(I do admit, that I did not spend too much time reading the manuals.)

This first little song of mine, was mainly "build" with the
wonderfull features of the sequencer (transpose,copy,insert etc.)
