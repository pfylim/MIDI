
  MUSTANG.MID : "Mustang Sally " a la Committments (programmed by Delia Layton)

  This song was developed using Cakewalk Professional V3 using a Proteus 1XR
  with Proteus 2 addition. The file is in MFF and does not contain SYSEX
  messages to set up the Proteus. If you require the WRK version mail us
  and we will upload it.

  The file contains CONTROLLER messages (generally 7 to set individual 
  volumes and sometimes 10 to set panning and 1 to set effects - especially
  Leslie for the organ).

  It also contains PROGRAM (patch) message which can be removed or amended as
  required.
