This is my second song on my new midi equipment.

I used a Roland U-20 keyboard, a Roland JV-880 expander with 
Voyetra's Sequencer plus working on an IBM PC.
                                                              
This song is dedicated to my brother's son "elias"

The patches are set as follows: (Roland JV-880)

Track 1   A21   warm vibe
Track 2   A49   fretless bass
Track 3   PRA   Drums        using sequences out of a compuserve file
                             with different drum-patterns.
                             Thank you, very much !!!
