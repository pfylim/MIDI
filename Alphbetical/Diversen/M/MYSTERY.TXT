Theme from PBS's "MYSTERY" by Normand Roger

Sequence (c) 1992 by Bob Pomicter, Studio 46 Music Study Center
Arranged for Roland Sound Canvas.

Notes:

MYSTERY.ZIP contains this text file, MYSTRYGS.MID and two additional
files: MYSTERY.SCD (for Jeff Cazel's SONGCANVAS V.2) and
MYSTERY.SYX for midi-ex loaders (such as Cazel's SYSEX).

It is *strongly* recommended that the file be played using the midi-ex
data since there are some major changes to the program patches (esp.
the Canvas's Special FX). 

Additionally, the special FX are NOT programmed into the sequence (only
the orchestral instruments are) so without the SCD or SYS-ex data users
will only hear default piano sounds in the FX lines.

Hope you enjoy "Mystery"!
Bob
