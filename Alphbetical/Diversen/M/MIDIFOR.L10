  This is a short (60') string quartet I wrote in Finale as an audition to
  the music for a Chicago theater production. It used the PCD401 sound card
  (MPU401 compatible) as the synth voices, which conforms to the General Midi
  specification of Windows. The file plays fine in Windows Media Player and
  I assume other MID players.

  great plucked bass sounds you should have no trouble  finding the right

  This is yet another JMJ piece called Rendez-Vous II. It's quite a large
  piece done on the Yamaha TG100 in General MIDI mode. Jarre fanatics will
  know that it gets a bit 'full' at the end of the track, so much so that it
  reaches the maximum polyphony of the TG100 (28 notes). For all that it
  doesn't sound bad on the Yamaha. I'd be interested to hear from anyone of
  what it sounds like on other MIDI equipment.

  My father played this on the piano when I was a kid, and it is my first
  foray into MIDI--I hope you like it. I have a Casio CT-640 and the number
  of notes one instrument can play is limited, so the left hand is
  assigned to regular piano while the right hand is honky tonk piano. It
  should all be honky  tonk if your synth can do it. I tried it on Sound
  Canvas at my work and it plays it fine, but of course instrument numbers
  have to be changed to match your synth. Let me know if you like it. (Eric

  These are the two movments of Bach's 3rd Brandenburg as uploaded last year
  in Ballade format.  The two movmements are zipped together in one
  file. Channels 2 to 8 inclusive are used for 1st 2nd & 3rd violins, two
  viola channels, two cellos and one bass.  The voices are all based on a
  "Switched on Bach" approach in the first movement, and conventional voices
  in the 3rd. As Ballade doesn't export to .mid very well, some tidying will
  be needed.  (Mike Ward)

  This is an arrangement and sequence of an old Scottish March for my Clan
  Colquhoun.  It is titled appropriately "Colquhoun's March".  The music I
  used for  this comes from a publication which is now out of print.  I was
  asked by a  member of our Clan Colquhoun Society to make a sequence of it
  as he was  learning to play the Bagpipe and would like to hear how it
  sounds.  I have left  out the normal Bagpipe grace notes, as they don't
  sound correctly on the GS  Sound Canvas for which it is sequenced.  I hope
  you enjoy it.  Larry Roberts

  Ch.2 a high staccato bass, Ch.3 keyboard (rock/jazz organ is best,  IMHO)

  Title   : "Goat Island" by John Renbourne (Pentangle); MFF
  Keywords: MFF MIDI RENBOURNE CELTIC
  "Goat Island," a ditty by John Renbourne (of Pentangle fame). Channel 1
  I used a funky player-piano sound, 2 and 3 should be the closest sounds
  you've got to accoustic guitar. (It was written as a solo guitar piece, and
  all the parts are the same, just a frog-hair apart in the attack to
  "fatten" the  sound). It's kinda Celtic with a bit of Ragtime thrown in!
  Enjoy!
