Theme for Law and Order.

Always thought this was a cool theme and a challenge to 
reproduce with midi. Since most Multi timbral Synths have 
great plucked bass sounds you should have no trouble 
finding the right sound for this on your midi system.
I apologize for this not being in midi standard. All I 
could do is just give you the instrument's name.
I invite any of you to fix it up if you like.
Enjoy
