Lute-Book Lullaby, from the MS. Lute Book by William Ballet, 
early seventeenth century.  


Lyric:

1.
Sweet was the song the Virgin sang,
when she to Bethlem Juda came
and was delivered of a son, 
That blessed Jesus hath to name.

Lulla, lulla, lulla, lullaby,
Lulla, lulla, lulla, lullaby.

'Sweet babe,' sang she, 
'my son, and eke a Savior born,
Who hast vouchsaf-ed from on high
to visit us that were forlorn:

la-lulla, la-lulla, la-lullaby,
Sweet babe,' sang she,
and rocked him sweetly on her knee.
