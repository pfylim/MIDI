Phantom of the Opera
Music by Andrew Llyod Webber
Midi Arrangement by Akio Nagatomi
October 15, 1992

This is a straight-forward arrangement of the title track from Andrew Lloyd-Webber's musical hit, "The Phantom of the Opera."  This is my first serious attempt at MIDI arrangement.  Work was done on a Roland LAPC-1 sound card (MT-32 compatible), using Ballade 2.51 and a Casio CPS-70 digital piano. Final touches were done in a great little shareware package, WinJammer 2.21, written by fellow Canadian Dan McKee.

Suggested track list is as follows:
