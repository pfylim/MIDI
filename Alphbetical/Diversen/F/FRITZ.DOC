    The enclosed file(s) are type 1 standard midi file(s) [.MID]
    and should load into any software that accepts that format.

  1) All drum notes are on midi channel #1. It is assumed that the volume
     of your drum sounds are balanced in relation to each other. If not,
     you may have to adjust the velocity of individual drums to taste. Some
     drum machines or samplers allow you to balance volumes independent of
     later velocity information. In general, all drum velocity ranges are
     centered around v=80.

  2) All bass notes are on midi channel #2. All bass velocity ranges are
     centered around v=80. You will have to set your synth, sampler, etc.
     with the correct sound prior to beginning the sequence or insert
     program change messages at the appropriate location.

  3) If a song has a keyboard or other part besides drums and bass, it is
     usually on midi channel #4. If it has two extra parts, they will
     usually appear on channels #4 and #5, etc.. All velocity ranges are
     centered around v=80. You will have to set your synth, sampler, etc.
     with the correct sound prior to beginning the sequence or insert
     program change messages at the appropriate location.

  4) These sequences are essentially rhythm section sequences. Their original
     purpose was to back up a guitar player. In other words, if the original
     song had a guitar part, there WILL NOT be a comparable part in the
     sequence. However, in some cases keyboard parts have been included to
     help fill things out.

  5) Where needed, songs have a 1-bar lead-in which is sounded by the HHPedal.

  6) In the secondary track name entries, m = midi channel and n = number of
     simultaneous notes this track requires.

     If you enjoy this sequence and/or would like to obtain more of them,
     call me and tell me so.  I would like to trade MIDI related ideas,
     techniques and files with you.
