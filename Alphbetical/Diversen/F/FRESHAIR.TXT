           Fresh Aire II     "Fantasia"      by Chip Davis
           -----------------------------------------------

This is a contemporary piano duet. I have sequenced each of the 4 hands
onto a separate MIDI channel (1 through 4) so that they could be sent to
different piano modules; 1 & 2 being for the more treble piano and 3 & 4
for the more bass piano.

If you use a single piano source, it must be capable of about 16 note
polyphony or you will notice some note clipping. Additionally, the piano
patch used should be able to sustain for a reasonable amount of time or
there will be voids at a few places within the sequence.

In addition, each piece within the entire work is separated onto its own
group of 4 tracks. The following are the full titles of each piece:

              Chorale             (The Theme)
              Door I              Interrupted Thought
              Door II             The Ugly Head of Greed
              Door III            Pride
              Door IV             Relaxation
              Door V              Frenetic Energy
              Door VI             Nostalgia
              Door VII            Thermal Inversion
              The Fantasy

                           Enjoy!
