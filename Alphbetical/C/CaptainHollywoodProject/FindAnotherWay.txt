
Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way

Find another way to me, find another way and make me free
Can you here my voice, so find another way, oh I fly to you
Pleace follow me, oh follow me.

Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way

Find another, another way

Find another, another way

Shake it, break it, know I can fake it
tuning of a level, can take it
pressure prising, hypertising, in your mind realising
move, move, you are on the move
you saw, what we groove
beat to the beat, fly 'em heap
make you jump by ading your speed

Got a jam, jam, watch me jam
'ill the beat you watch me slam
pumpin', pumpin', look over something
how we scratchin', leavin' nothing
shake it, shake it everyday
keeping busy day by day
you find, you find another way.

Find another way to me, find another way and make me free
Can you here my voice, so find another way, oh I fly to you
Pleace follow me, oh follow me.

Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way

Find another, another way

Meet them moling alway holing,
got to keep study, I'm rollin'
project gona dance for working brain growing
but circlin' no way out, no way out, gona' make it right
no doubt respect, what I'm looking for,
make it no more, hit the door.

The blaster makin' it faster,
turn it loud, speak a blaster
boost the sound, you found,
keeping it from the underground,
kick the bases, what I say,
keeping it pumpin' day by day
you find, you find another way.

Find another way to me, find another way and make me free
Can you here my voice, so find another way, oh I fly to you
Pleace follow me, oh follow me.

Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way

Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way

Ohohoho, find another way
Ohohoho, find another, another way
