Picture postcards from L.A. 					 Joshua Kadison

I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
and Rachel she's the waitress
Who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it
Make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A.

When it's time for closing
I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music
I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it
She's going all the way
And I say
"Send me picture postcards from L.A."

Refrain
Send me postcards from L.A.
Signed with love forever more
Picture postcards from L.A.
To hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one
I'd love
A picture of the California sun

When Rachel shares my pillow
She always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty
Do I like the way she sings?
I don't know her to answer
So I always smile and say
I say, "send me picture postcards from L.A."

Refrain
Send me postcards from L.A......

Sometimes Rachel stands up
In the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, "next week, I'm gonna go"
She'll eve buy a ticket
And pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story
We pretend that we believe
But sometimes always comes up
Something always makes her stay
And still
No picture postcards from L.A.

Refrain
Send me postcards from L.A.......

I'm the piano player down in Eddie's bar
And Rachel is the waitress
Who wants to be a star
