This is an excellent sequence of Jon Bon Jovi's "Livin' on a Prayer."  This
file is in Standard MIDI (Type 0) format.

Editor's Note: Type 0 files are single-track files, but that track can
contain data on all16 MIDI channels. When loaded in most sequencers, data for
each channel is split to individual tracks, but none of those tracks will be
named.  Please check to see if you sequencer, or sound card will playback
this type file before downloading.

Note:  This sequence can be used with non-GM synths by loading it into a
sequencer and re-assigning the Program Change and MIDI Channel data to meet
the requirements of your equipment.
