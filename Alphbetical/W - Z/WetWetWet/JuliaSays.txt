                        ==========================


         Here we go again, thru the backstreets,
         Of my mind,
         It seems my life was standing still,
         Who's sorry now, it's funny,
         How I didn't know it.

         Here we go again, fighting things we never win,
         It seems our love was standing still, uh, I'm sorry now.
         It's funny now I don't feel the love,
         I just hear the words, Julia says.

         She doesn't know what is all about,
         She doesn't seem to care at all,
         Open your eyes and see,
         Love hurts.

         I won't be fooled again,
         Looking for the dreams I couldn't find,
         The dreams for me were left behind,
         Oh, I'm sorry now, It's funny now,
         I don't feel the love,
         I just hear the words, Julia says.

         She doesn't know what is all about,
         She doesn't seem to care at all,
         Open your eyes and see, love hurts,
         Julia please, open your eyes and see,

         Julia wants to be on her own,
         Sharing her thoughts, she is all alone,
         Dreaming of the things,
         She wants to be,
         Where Julia don't belong.

         Julia said,
         She doesn't know what it's all about,
         She doesn't know,
         Julia plase, open your eyes and see,
         Come on Julia, open your eyes and see,
         She doesn't know what it's all about,
         Julia please, Julia please,
         You don't care at all 'cose I want you,
         Come on come on Julia.......
