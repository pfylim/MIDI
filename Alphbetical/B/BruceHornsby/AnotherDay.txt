                      =========================

         Well you got me boy, feeling just like a fool,
         Hey I'm not your toy don't you treat me cruel,
         Don't you stop me now doing what I wanna do,
         Boy you're out o' line.
         Now this life is mine, I can do it alone,
         And I'm feelin' fine, now I'm here on my own,
         Don't you see me eyes, I'm lookin' right for something new,
         Boy you're out o' line, I can't live another day with you,
         Another day with you.

         Well I've seen the light, and I'm gettin' at soon,
         'Cause you tied me out, and my loving is through,
         I can tell no lies, there is nothing left for you,
         Boy you're out o' line.
         Now this life is mine, I can do it alone,
         And I'm feelin' fine, now I'm here on my own,
         Don't you see my eyes, I'm lookin' right for something new,
         Boy you're out o' line, I can't live another day with you,
         Another day with you.

         Another, another, another, another day with you,
         With you,
         Another day with you, with you...

         Oooh...uh... O, oh...This life is mine...

         Now this life is mine, I can do it alone,
         And I'm feelin' fine, now I'm here on my own,
         Don't you see my eyes, I'm lookin' right for something new,
         Boy you're out o' line, I can't live another day with you,
         With you, another day with you,
         With you, another day with you,
         Another day, another day, oh, oh, another day with you,
         Another day, another day, another day with you,
         No, no, oh, oh, another day with you,
         No, no, I can't live another day with you,
         Another day, another day, with you,
         Another day with you,
         With you,
         Another day with you....
