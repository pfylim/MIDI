VAYA CON DIOS

Now the Hacienda's dark, the town is sleeping, 
Now the time has come to part
The time for weeping
Vaya con Dios, My darling
May God be with you, my love

Now the village mission bells
Are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart
You'll hear them singing
Vaya con Dios, My darling
May God be with you, my love
Wherever you may be,
I'll be beside you 
Although you're many million dreams away.
Each night I say a prayer, a prayer to guide you.
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day

Now the dawn is breaking through a grey tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con Dios, My darling
May God be with you, my love
Wherever you may be,
I'll be beside you 
Although you're many million dreams away.
Each night I say a prayer, a prayer to guide you.
To hasten ev'ry lonely hour of ev'ry lonely day

MOON RIVER

Moon river, wider than a mile:
I'm crossing you in style someday.
Old dream maker, you heart breaker, wherever you're goin'
I'm going your way
Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see.
We're after the same rainbow's end
Waiting 'round the bend, my Huckleberry friend, Moon River and me.
