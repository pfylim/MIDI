CHAKA KHAN - EYE TO EYE

I'm in the mood to end these empty days
Every night you stare down romancing
Every time I see your face
Hopeless colder than ice with no more flames
I think our love has reached the point of no return
It's so sad when lovers don't see

Refrain:
Eye to eye a look says everything
Eye to eye so close so far away

That distant look is all you've got to say
Every time I try to talk to you
Every world is lost in space
Drifting further apart in every way
We've come to be the ones
whose love is out of sight
It's so clear that we just don't see

Refrain: ...

There's no reason for this heartache
To go on and on when the feeling's gone
I can see now that it's too late
To try and change your mind

Everything everything
You're further away
Try and change your mind
Everything yeah a look

Refrain: ...
