Title  : THE ELEPHANT SONG

Tell me said the elephant
Tell me brothers if you can
Why all the world is full of creatures
Yet we go appear a man

Tell me said the elephant
Tell me why this has to be
We have to run from man-the-hunter
Never safe and never free

Refrain:
People kill without regret
Although they fly by jumbo-jet
Let the world of man remember
Let the children not forget

Gentle is the elephant
Pulling loads and everything
We love to hear the children laughing
When we're in the circusring

Happy was the elephant
Happy was his jungle life
And then there came the cruel hunter
With a rifle and a knife

Refrain: ...

Listen please listen, said the elephant
If we want the world, we know, to stay alive
Then man and beast must work together
And together we will survive

Listen said the elephant
It is conservation time
So take the warning, when we trumpet
For the future of man kind
