You make me a stranger
that's what time can do
baby you mean ev'rything to me
darling there's no danger
for all that we've been through
that anyone could love you more than me.

I've got news for you babe
all the things you do babe
make me think of how it used to be.
And it looks like I'm falling all over again
head over heals in love with you.
Yes it looks like I'm falling all over again
head over heals in love with you.

Will I get through to you babe
I love ev'rything you do babe,
the same old feeling this time's feeling new.
And it looks like I'm falling all over again
head over heals in love with you.
Yes it looks like I'm falling all over again
head over heals in love with you.
In love with you, in love with you.
