NIK KERSHAW - THE RIDDLE

I got two strong arms
Blessing of Babylon
With time to carry on
And try
For sins and false alarms
Wise men save

Refrain:
Near a tree by a river
There's a hole in the ground
Where an old man of Aran
Goes around and around
And his mind is a beacon
In the veil of the night
For a strange kind of fashion
There's a wrong and a right
But he'll never, never fight over you

I got plans for us
Night in the scullery
And days instead of me
I only know what to discuss
Oh for anything but light
Wise men fighting over you

It's not me you see
Pieces of Valentine
With just a song of mine
To keep from burning history
Seasons of gasoline and gold
Wise men fold

Refrain: ...

I got time to kill
Sly looks in corridors
Without a plan of yours
A blackbird sings of bluebird hill
Thanks to the calling of the wild
Wise men child

Refrain: ...
