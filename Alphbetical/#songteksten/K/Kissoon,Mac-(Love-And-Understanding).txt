Title  : LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING

(Words & music: G. Shelter/M. Kissoon/Dunhills)

There'll be peace over the world
For every boy and girl
There'll be love and understanding all around
There'll be one wonderful world
For every boy and girl
When we all just love each other all around

Chorus:
(There'll be) love and understanding
Peace and harmony
When we learn to love each other in this world
(There'll be) love and understanding
Peace and harmony
Only when we love each other in this world

No more wars where people die
No more hurt for one to try
When we start to love each other all around

Chorus: ...

Daddy, I'm so happy
You always love me true
I wish that all the people were like you

Chorus: ...

Maybe once we'll love each other
