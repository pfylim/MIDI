KING - LOVE & PRIDE

Refrain:
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride
That's what my heart yearns for now
Love and pride

Start your journey early or maybe later
(Get your boots on)
Look for rainbows (it's cloudy)
Take your hair dryer blow them all away

In you I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you I see all colors not just black and white
In you I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill you're my supply of love and pride

Refrain: ...

Knowing sensing seeing eating sleeping
(That's just being) touching testing loving
Wanting and taking more love and more pride

In you I've found a story I want to keep hearing
In you I see all colors not just black and white
In you I find a reason and hope for all dreamers
You are my fill you're my supply of love and pride

Refrain: ...

I'm taking it round the world
W-wo-wo-wo-world
I'm taking it round the world
Some love and pride
