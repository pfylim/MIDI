Title  : WHAT'S HIS NAME?

(Words & music: Roger Cook/Bobby Woods)

I went dancing at the disco last night
I saw this boy and I think I saw the light
Had to find out who he was
Had to find out, I had to find out

Chorus:
What's his name, what's his number
What's his name, what's his number
What's his name, what's his number

I couldn't believe that he was lookin' my way
He turned to his friends
This is what I heard him say
Who is that girl, who is that girl
I've got to find out, I've got to find out

Chorus: ...

Somethin' deep inside
Made me warm towards that boy
He looked so good, he looked so fine
My head was in a whirl
But his eyes were askin' the same thing

Chorus: ...
