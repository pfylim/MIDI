Title  : I'M YOUR BOOGIE MAN

(Words & music: H.W. Casey/R. Finch)

I'm your boogie man that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight it's never too soon
To want to please you, to want to keep you
I want to do it all, all for you
I want to be your rubberball
I want to be the one you love most of all

Refrain:
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what I want
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
Turn me on
I'm your boogie man, I'm your boogie man
I'll do what I want
Oh yeah

I'm your boogie man that's what I am
I'm here to do whatever I can
Be it early morning, late afternoon
Or at midnight it's never too soon
To want to take you, to want to hold you
I want to give all, all to you
And I want you to completely understand
Just where I'm at and where I am

Refrain: ...

I want to be with you, I want to be with you
Yeah, we'll be together, you and me
I want to see you, ah get near you
I want to love you, ah, from sundown sun up
Oh yeah

Refrain: ...
