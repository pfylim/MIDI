Tonight
I want to give it all to you
in the darkness
there's so much I want to do
and tonight
I want to lay it at your feet
'cause girl, I was made for you
girl, you were made for me.

I was made for lovin' you baby
you were made for loving me
and I can't get enough of you baby
can you get enough of me ?

Tonight I want to see it in your eyes
feel the magic
there's something that drives me wild
and tonight
we're gonna make it all come true
'cause girl, you were made for me
girl, I was made for you.

I was made for lovin' you baby
you were made for loving me
and I can't get enough of you baby
can you get enough of me ?

I was made for lovin' you baby
you were made for loving me
and I can't get enough of you baby
can you get enough of me ?

I was made for lovin' you baby
you were made for loving me
and I can't get enough of you baby
can you get enough of me ?
