SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW

Text + Musik: Kemmler/Karo/Taylor

Eyes are on the ring
Watching for the blood
Closer to defeat
Nearer to the mud
--------------------------------------------------------
I bet you've got a girl outside
A heavyweight with lots of
Pride
Waiting for the count from one
To ten
--------------------------------------------------------
One below the belt
And I'm hanging on the rope
My hands begin to swell
And I can't keep up my gloves
--------------------------------------------------------
And I feel
Punches like a razor edge
They're tearing deep inside
My head
With none there to throw my
Towel in
--------------------------------------------------------
CHORUS:
   Is there something I should know
   Why won't anybody tell me now
   Before they beat my brains out
   On the floor
--------------------------------------------------------
Is there something I should know
I will always be the loser
For it really doesn't matter
Where I go
--------------------------------------------------------
Standing in the rain
I've got one more ronund to go
Living day to day
For the one-way T.K.O.
--------------------------------------------------------
Now I meet you face to face
So keep your pity it's too late
Time will come and then you'll
Feel the rain
