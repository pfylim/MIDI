Singer : GLADYS KNIGHT & THE PIPS 
Title  : COME BACK AND FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED

(Words & music: Van McCoy/Joe Cobb)

Come back and finish what you started
Don't leave me hanging on and on
Come back and finish what you started
Don't leave me hanging on and on

You planted seeds of love in my heart
With all the tender words you said at the start
And love is something you shouldn't begin
If you're not gonna see it on to the end

A taste of honey is a dangerous thing
When love is gone, the memory clears
Like the promise I heart you repeat
That you left undone and didn't keep
