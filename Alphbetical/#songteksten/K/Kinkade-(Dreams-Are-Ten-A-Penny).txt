  2. DREAMS ARE TEN A PENNY - KINKADE
  
  When we were children
  We played in your backyard
  Then we pretended
  Whenever times were hard
  We built a house up in a tree
  And dreamed of how our life would be
  But now the tree has died.
  
  So I've got to say to you
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Leave them in the lost and found
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Get your feet back on the ground
  Owowowow.
  
  You dreamed of heroes 
  Riding across the sea
  In shining armour
  But all you had was me
  While all the time you never knew
  All I could do was dream of you
  And still I do today.
  
  So I've got to say to you
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Leave them in the lost and found
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Get your feet back on the ground
  Owowowow.
  
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Leave them in the lost and found
  Jenny, Jenny dreams are ten a penny
  Get your feet back on the ground
  Owowowow
  Owowowow...
