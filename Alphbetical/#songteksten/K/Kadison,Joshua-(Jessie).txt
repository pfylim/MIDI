  6. JESSIE (JOSHUA KADISON)
  
  FROM A PHONE BOOTH IN VEGAS
  JESSIE CALLS AT 5 AM
  TO TELL ME HOW SHE'S TIRED OF ALL OF THEM
  SHE SAYS "BABE, I BEEN THINKING 'BOUT A TRAILER BY THE SEA
  WE COULD GO TO MEXICO...
  YOU, THE CAT, AND ME
  WE'LL DRINK TEQUILA
  AND LOOK FOR SEA SHELLS
  NOW, DOESN'T THAT SOUND SWEET?"
  OH, JESSIE, YOU ALWAYS DO THIS
  EVERYTIME
  I GET BACK ON MY FEET
  
  JESSIE PAINT YOUR PICTURES
  'BOUT HOW IT'S GONNA BE
  BY NOW I SHOULD KNOW BETTER
  YOUR DREAMS ARE NEVER FREE
  BUT TELL ME ALL
  ABOUT OUR LITTLE TRAILER BY THE SEA
  JESSIE YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL
  ANY DREAM TO ME
  OH, JESSIE YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL
  ANY DREAM TO ME
  
  SHE ASKS ME HOW THE CAT'S BEEN
  I SAY, "MOSES HE'S JUST FINE
  BUT HE USED TO THINK ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME
  WE FINALLY
  TOOK YOUR PICTURES DOWN OFF THE WALL
  OH, JESSIE, HOW DO YOU ALWAYS SEEM
  TO KNOW
  JUST WHEN TO CALL?"
  SHE SAYS, "GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER
  BRING MOSES AND DRIVE REAL FAST"
  AND LISTEN TO HER PROMISE
  "I SWEAR TO GOD
  THIS TIME IT'S GONNA LAST".
  
  I'LL LOVE YOU IN THE SUNSHINE
  LAY YOU DOWN IN THE WARM WHITE SAND
  AND WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THIS TIME
  THINGS'LL TURN OUT
  JUST THE WAY YOU PLANNED
