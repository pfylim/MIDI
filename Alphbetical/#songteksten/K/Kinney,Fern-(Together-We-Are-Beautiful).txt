Title  : TOGETHER WE ARE BEAUTIFUL

(Words & music: ?)

He walked into my life
And now he is talking over
And it's beautiful
Yes, it's beautiful

I walked with better looking guys
He's gone with pretty young looking girls
And now we are beautiful
I think we are beautiful

Chorus:
I don't need love affairs anymore
I don't need love affairs anymore
Can't you see
It's the chemistry
You're most agree, together we are beautiful
We are so beautiful

I am the rain, he is the sun
And now we made a rainbow
I think it's beautiful
It's really beautiful

Chorus: ...

And if the whole world falls in love
Just let me in my name
This would be beautiful
This would be so beautiful

I don't need love affairs anymore
No, I don't need love affairs anymore
Can't you see
It's the chemistry
And together we are beautiful
We are beautiful
Can't you see
It's the chemistry
You're most agree
Together we are beautiful
We are beautiful
Beautiful, ooh beautiful
Oooooh, we are beautiful, beautiful
