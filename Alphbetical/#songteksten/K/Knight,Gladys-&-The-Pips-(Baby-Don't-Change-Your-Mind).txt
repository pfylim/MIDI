Title  : BABY DON'T CHANGE YOUR MIND

(Words & music: Van McCoy)

Your ex is back in town
What cha gonna do when she comes around
And she starts goin' through her act
When she begs you to take her back
Will your love for me remain in tact
Or will you run to her?

Chorus:
Baby, my love is on the line
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Be strong, and leave the past behind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
Don't change it

You say your love is true
What cha gonna say when she looks at you
Will the second thoughts in your head
Make you take back the things you said
Will you give in and be mislead
Or will you stay with me

Chorus: ...

I would exit and take my bow
But I don't want to lose you now
So I'm beggin', someway, somehow
Baby, you'll stay with me

Chorus: ...

You know she's got not the staying kind
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
You know my love is genuine
Baby, don't change your mind
Don't change it
