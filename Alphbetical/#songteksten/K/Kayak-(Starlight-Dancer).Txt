Title  : STARLIGHT DANCER

(Words & music: Ton Scherpenzeel)

The fight is over
The war is lost and I see
A lifeless soldier staring at me
Fear and despair drawing his face
Left in this god forsaken place
Who cares for the nameless so far from home

Which way you're going
There is no room for your pride
No fame, no glory, lay all aside
Life is a star, drowned in the day
More than a million miles away
From home, from the place where my heart belongs

I've been sailing the seas
Traveling all the land to chase the golden sword
All the time I held it here in my very hands
Till someone cut the chord

I ruled the oceans, taking ships in reverse
Stealing all I could find
Having no peace of mind as I crossed the earth
I've had my residences all over space
Bridging light years each day
Only one dream away from the cosmic stage
Starlight dancer

A live performance so the world will see
I'm aligning the stars
Universal in art, see the god in me
Starlight dancer, that's my destiny
Starlight dancer, starlight dancer

Far from home, from the place where my heart belongs
Free at last, but I've never felt so alone
Starless, stardust
