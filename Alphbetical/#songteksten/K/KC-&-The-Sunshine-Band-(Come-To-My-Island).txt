Title  : COME TO MY ISLAND

(Words & music: Casey/Finch)

Chorus:
Come to my island, just you and me
Come to my island, where we'll be free
We'll be free

There's no hate around, there's none to be found
There's love everywhere, you'll feel it in the air
Come to my island, there's plenty of room
It's the kind of place you'd want to come to real soon

Chorus: ...

We'll dance and sing, oh baby, we'll swing
Under the moonlight, doing our thing
Just you and me and silence is the sound
Nobody else anywhere around, so

Chorus: ...

Forget about your troubles, forget about your past
The day is here now, we've got to make it last
I'll hold you in my arms, love you some more
Keep you in my heart, for evermore

Chorus: ...
