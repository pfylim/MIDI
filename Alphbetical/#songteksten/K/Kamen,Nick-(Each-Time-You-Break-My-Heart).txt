EACH TIME YOU BREAK MY HEART - NICK KAMEN


Each time you break my heart
Each time you break my heart

I know how it feels to be the talk of the town
I'm not gonna let you go and run around
I need to know that you'll be true to me
'cause that's the way it's got to be
Why can't you give your promise to me
Is love so blind that you cannot see
I'm trying hard not to walk out the door
Know what I know
Know that I can't take no more

Each time you break my heart
I try to put my pride aside
Each time you break my heart
A little voice inside me cries

No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you anyway
And if you're so sure that I'm not your kind
How come you can't just walk away
In the beginning  we were nothing but glad
Those were the best days that we ever had
There's no compassion
All your warmth is gone
Tell me how oh how can I keep holding on

Each time you break my heart ...
I see the look in your eyes
I know you're hurting inside
Let me try
To make you love me again
Not say that I knew you when you were mine
Were mine
(Each time) oh yeah

In the beginning we were nothing but glad ...

I see the look in your eyes ...

Each time you break my heart again
Well I can say I knew you well
(Each time) you're mine
(Each time you break my heart)
I try to put my pride aside
(Each time you break my heart)
