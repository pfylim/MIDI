Title  : IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD TIME

(Words & music: Tony Macaulay)

Chorus:
It's a better than good time
For making up your mind to stay
It's a better than good time
Now you're here with me this way
'Cause I've changed a lot
From how I was then
Tell me that you're ready to try again
It's a better than good time
For making up your mind about love

It's taken half of my life to see
Maybe the best thing that ever happened to me
I just escaped through my fingers
And he was nothing at all, nothing at all
All my old friends out of touch
And my own company doesn't drill me too much
Now right it's hard to imagine
I used to believe it couldn't happen to me
It shouldn't happen to me

Chorus: ...

You could say I'm the classic case
My own thoughtlessness thrown back in my face
Till that part of my life
I'd learned nothing at all
Nothing at all
When midnight holds no more
That a worn out movie that you've seen before
That's when you start realizing what life can be

Chorus: ...
