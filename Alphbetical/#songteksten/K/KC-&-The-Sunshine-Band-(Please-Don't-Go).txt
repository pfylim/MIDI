Title  : PLEASE DON'T GO

(Words & music: H.W. Casey/R. Finch)

I love you
Yeah
Babe, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

Chorus:
Please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Please don't go
Don't go
I'm begging you to stay

If you leave
At least in my lifetime
I've had one dream come true
I was blessed to be loved
By someone as wonderful as you

Chorus: ...

Hey, hey, hey
Yeah
Babe I love you so
I, I want you to know
That I'm going to miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

So, please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away
Hey, hey, hey

I need your love
I'm down on my knees
Beggin', please, please, please
Don't go
Don't you hear me baby
Don't leave me now
Please don't go
I want you to know
That I, I, I, love you so
Don't leave me baby
Please don't go
