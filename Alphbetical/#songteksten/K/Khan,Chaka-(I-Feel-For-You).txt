CHAKA KHAN - I FEEL FOR YOU

Baby baby when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do
That keeps me satisfied
I wouldn't lie to you baby
It makes me wanna sing

Refrain:
I feel for you
I think I love you
I feel for you
I think I love you
I think it's love I feel for you
I think it's love

Baby baby when I lay with you
There's no place I'd rather be
I can't believe can't believe it's true
The things that you do to me
I wouldn't lie to you baby
I'm physically attracted to you
This feeling that I got for you baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

Refrain: ...
