Title  : CHANCE FOR A LIFETIME

Remember Noah brought his ship a long long time ago
It's blessed that he ever did
No one believed his warnings, laughing, shrugging
Asking: Is there any need of it?
They found out they were wrong and he was right
As the water rose the cresting tide sealed their fate
It's such an old but true cliche, to say our days are
numbered
Life for us is nearly through
There's only one way out and that's to build a spaceship
God knows where it's gonna lead us to
I'll be your captain, leader, hero, saint, guide and king
The one who had this brilliant idea
I'll be happy to accept all medals for having saved
All millions following me
We'll sail the second Ark, tickets are cheap
You can even choose a windowseat if you wish
Let other people snicker, silly fools
When they come to grip with nature's rules we'll be gone
Are you still asking me if I would take the risk
You must have lost your mind
It may be a change for a lifetime
Are you still asking me if I would take the risk
You must have lost your mind
It may be a change for a lifetime
