Title  : I'M JUST DREAMING

Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda

Dreaming, I'm just dreaming
Every day, dreaming my life away
Just waiting, hoping and praying
That you'll come back to me
End all this misery

Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda
Dum dum, damidooda

Don't make me wait too long
It's here where you belong
Don't keep me hanging on
Come on back and dry these tears
Baby please
Don't leave me here
Just waiting, hoping and praying
That you'll come back to me
End all this misery
