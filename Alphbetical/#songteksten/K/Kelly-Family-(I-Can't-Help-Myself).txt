1. I CAN`T HELP MYSELF - KELLY FAMILY

If I would tell you 
How much you mean to me,
I think you wouldn`t understand it.
So, I`ll wait, I`ll wait 
Until this day comes,
And you will understand me.
But I can`t help myself, 
I can`t stop myself,
I am going crazy.
And I can`t stop myself, 
I cannot control myself,
I am going crazy.

And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .
And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .

I cannot change it, 
I`m sure not making it,
One big hell of a fuss.
I cannot turn my back, 
Got to face the fact,
Life without you is crazy.

And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .
And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .

Kiss me, thrill me, don`t say goodbye.
Hold me, love me, don`t say goodbye.
Oh ooh woe ooh oh oh.
Don`t say goodbye.

But I can`t help myself, 
And I can`t stop myself,
I am going crazy.
I cannot turn my back, 
I`ve got to face the facts,
Life without you is hazy.

And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .
And I love you, I want you, 
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna be with you .

Oh ooh woe ooh oh oh.
And oh ooh woe ooh oh.
Kiss me good bye.
