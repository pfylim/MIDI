8. Ricky King Medley - Yesterday/The Sound Of Silence

YESTERDAY
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away,
Now it looks as though they're here to stay.
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go I don't know,
She wouldn't say.
I said something wrong,
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play,
Now I need a place to hide away.
Oh I believe in yesterday,

THE SOUND OF SILENCE
Hello darkness, my old friend,
I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within
The sound of silence.

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of coble-stone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp.
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light that split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share and no one
Dare disturb the sound of silence.

"Fools!" said I, "You do not know silence like a cancer grows"
"Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you".
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed in the wells of silence.

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning.
In the words that it was forming,
And the signs said "The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whisper'd in the sound of silence.
