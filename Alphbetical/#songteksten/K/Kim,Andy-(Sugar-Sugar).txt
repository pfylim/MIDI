Sugar, ah, honey,
you are my candy girl
and you've got me wanting you
Sugar, ah, honey,
you are my candy girl
and you've got me wanting you.
I just can't believe the loveliness
of loving you.
(I just can't believe its true)
I just can't believe the one to love this feeling to.
(I just can't believe its true)

Sugar, ah, honey,
you are my candy girl
and you've got me wanting you
Sugar, ah, honey,
you are my candy girl
and you've got me wanting you.
When I kissed you, girl, I knew how sweet
a kiss could be.
(I know how sweet a kiss can be)
Like the summer sunshine, pour your sweetness over me.
(Pour your sweetness over me)

Pour a little sugar on it, honey.
Pour a little sugar on it, baby.
I'm gonna make your life so sweet, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pour a little sugar on it, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Pour a little sugar on it, honey.
Pour a little sugar on it, baby.
I'm gonna make your life so sweet, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pour a little sugar on it, honey. Ah !
