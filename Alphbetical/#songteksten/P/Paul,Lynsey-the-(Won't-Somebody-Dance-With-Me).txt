Singer : LINSEY THE PAUL 
Title  : WON'T SOMEBODY DANCE WITH ME

And now the band is playing very slow
And once again I'll get my coat
And go a lonely wallflower waiting by the wall
Without the willpower to face the music at all
Please won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone to care, someone somewhere
Who will dance with me

I feel so silly in my patent shoes
So many partners, but none of them will choose
A lonely wallflower growing very tired
into the small hours and feeling undesired
Won't somebody dance with me
Start up a romance with me
Just someone somewhere, someone who'll dare
take a chance with me
Just someone to care, someone somewhere
Who will dance with me

(May I have the pleasure of this dance)
