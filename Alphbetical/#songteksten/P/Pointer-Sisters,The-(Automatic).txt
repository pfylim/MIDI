POINTER SISTERS - AUTOMATIC

Look what you've done to me
I'm utterly at your whim
All of my defenses down
Your camera looks through me with its X-ray vision
And all systems run aground
All I can manage to push from my lips
Is a stream of absurdities
Every word I intend to speak winds up
Locked in the circuitry

Refrain:
No way to control it, it's totally automatic
Whenever you're around
I'm walking blind-folded completely automatic
All of my systems are down
Down down down
Automatic (automatic) automatic (automatic)

What is this madness that makes my motor run
My legs too weak to stand
I go from sadness to exhilaration
Like a robot at your command
My hands perspire and shake like a leaf
Up and down goes my temperature
I summon doctors to get some relief
But they tell me there is no cure
(They tell me)
