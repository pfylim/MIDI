Singer : PILOT 
Title  : JANUARY

January, sick and tired you've been hanging on me
You make me sad with your eyes, you're telling me lies
Don't go, don't go
January, don't be cold, don't be angry to me
You made me sad come and see, oh January don't go, don't go

Life gets me higher (higher)
I can show I can go
I can wake up the world, little world
Gotta know you, gotta show you
Sun, like a fire (fire)
Carry on, don't be gone
Bring me out of my home
Show me, you'll be facing the world
You'll be chasing the world

Time it's a flyer (flyer)
Sunny days fly away
English summers are gone
So long, gotta go up, gotta grow up
Sun like a fire (fire)
Carry on, don't be gone
Bring me out of my home
Show me, you'll be facing the world
You'll be chasing the world
