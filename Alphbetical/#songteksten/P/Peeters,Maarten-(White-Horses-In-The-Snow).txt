MAARTEN PETERS - WHITE HORSES IN THE SNOW

(Words & music: Maarten Peters)

She was no woman still more than a child
I met her in the park the night had been wild
She had made a picture and asked me what I saw
So I looked close but I saw nothing she said

Chorus:
White horses in the snow
White horses in the snow
And you don't know where they come from
And you don't know where they go
White horses, in the snow

I asked her what it meant she started to cry
You'd call me an angel who fell out of the sky
I know in time you'll be like me
'Cause in the end we're all the same she said

Chorus: ...2x...

White horses in the snow (6x)
