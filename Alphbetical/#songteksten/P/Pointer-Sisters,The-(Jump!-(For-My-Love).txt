POINTER SISTERS - JUMP (FOR MY LOVE)

Your eyes tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heartbeat
I know you like what you see
Hold me I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited I can feel you getting hotter
Oh, baby
I'll take you down I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more if you want more more
more then

Refrain:
Jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump jump for my love
Jump I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in you know these arms can fill you up
Jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Jump jump for my love

You told me I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does it like I do
Then make a move before you try and go much
farther oh baby
You are the one you are the one and heaven waits
here at my door
And if you want more if you want more more
More then

Refrain: ...

When you are next to me I come alive
You're the perfect sight
It feels so right come to me if you want me tonight

Jump jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Then jump jump jump jump ooh yeah
You know my heart can make you happy jump
You know these arms can fill you up jump in
If you want to taste my kisses in the night then
Then jump jump for my love
Jump come on and jump on in
Jump you know I need you I've got to have you
