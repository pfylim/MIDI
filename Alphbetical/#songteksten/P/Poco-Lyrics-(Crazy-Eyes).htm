Take the water blue water
Can you see how far it is from flowin' free
Can we let it just be
Without a feelin' of bein' just a little guilty
Alright

Get your water green water wipe your eyes in it
Still isn't very clear
It wouldn't be wise to get too near
Save the cause of your own true fear
Yes I remember when it turned the bend in a natural way
It seems there was a time in my mind
When it caught the light of day
I want to see it talkin' back to the sun
I need to feel it wild and on the run

I remember when it turned the bend in a natural way
Seems there was a time in my mind
When it caught the light of day
I want to see it talkin' back to the sun
I need to feel it wild and on the run

C'mon and get your water - blue water
Can we settle for what you can give
Sure and behold you're without the need to live
And a'changin' wind may bring you back to blue again
I'm havin' a time tellin' my children when

When I last saw you I couldn't find a reason why
I felt kind o' blue watching you
Hello my sweet friend I've come to sing a lullaby
Can I make amends or should I try

Ooo - Mama can't you see it's not the same
Lookin' back behind A-can't start anew
But then here we go again

Searching back to you I've finally come to realize
When we were as two - tellin' lies
Livin' so afraid we never read between the lines
It's different from today - the sun, it shines

When I first saw you I knew I couldn't change my mind
Twisted point of view - another kind
But love is what we choose and not for us to reason why
Sometimes love we lose and never try

Ooh - Could it really be it's not the same
Lookin' back behind is such a silly game
But here we go again

<PRE>
(Gram Parsons)

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues
And tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes

My mind was young and then it grew
My thoughts known only by a few
A dream much too real to be leaned against too long
And all the time I guess she knew

Her thoughts still dance inside my head
Her comb still lies beside the bed
But the sun comes up without her, it doesn't know she's gone
And it remembers nothing that she said

Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes
Warm evenings, pale mornings, bottled blues
And tiny golden pins that she wore up in her hair
Brass buttons, green silks and silver shoes

All you cowboys and your ladies
Take your boots off, they'll drive you crazy
When you come to town take a look around
Yes, you're off of your horse, you can set your soghts on a
Stronger course

And I mean you
And everybody too
Can you come on through
Come on through

Politicians, and your writers
Trading people's dreams
You've got moon blindness
While you're reaching for the winner's club
Keep your feet on the ground and your ears on what is
Coming down

And I mean you
And everybody too
Can you come on through
Come on through

All you singers and your lovely songs
Try so very hard to make them all belong
Some get taken others foresaken
We keep a'movin' a right along

And how about you
And everybody too
Can you come on through
Come on through

I got a feeling about you, love who's fooling who
Crazy eyes I been a foolin' you
You sing songs about brass buttons and shiny silver shoes
Crazy eyes what had you to lose

Down among the South Caroline pines
You spent most of your lifetime in deep thought
Then changes come about and you find the time you spent
Wasn't quite reason for being bought

So now to be or not to be is the question...now
Crazy eyes don't you forget how
I'm used to seeing your face in the crowd and you thought you
Saw me
Crazy eyes blind as you can be

<PRE>
(John J. Cale)

Whippoorwill's singing, soft summer breeze;
Makes me think of my baby left down in New Orleans,
I left down in New Orleans
Magnolia you sweet thing, you're driving me mad
Got to get back to you, baby;
You're the best I ever had;
You're the best I ever had;
You whisper, "Good Morning" so gently in my ear;
I'm coming to you baby;
I'll soon be there
I'll soon be there

Slippin' away headin' out to L.A.
Gonna sing in city tonight, tonight
Slippin' away headin' out to L.A.
Gonna sing in city tonight
This rock 'n' roll feelin's got my head reelin'
A feelin' I know that is right
So c'mon let's dance
Let's dance and maybe if you like we could be just like
Old friends that new friends could like
Cause only a few do what you can sure do
And only a few do it right
So c'mon let's dance let's dance tonight

Just let me take you dancin' dancin'
In the moonlight the summer night what a night
And baby while we're dancin' dancin'
We'll take our time to ease our minds come alive
Yes baby while we're dancin' dancin'
We can sing while guitars scream, we'll make a dream
Then maybe while we're dancin' dancin'
Remember then the feelin' when
We were slippin' away headin' out to L.A.
This rock 'n' roll feelin's got my head reelin'
A feelin' I know that is right
So c'mon let's dance let's dance tonight
