Simply irresistable       Robert Palmer 


How can it be permissible ?
She compromise my principle .
Yeah , yeah .
That kind of love is mythical ,
she's anything but typical .
She's a craze you'd endorse ,
She's a powerful force .
You're obliged to conform
When there's no other course .

Refrain

Well she used to look good to me
But now I find her ...
Simply irresistable , simply irresistable .

Her love is so powerful ,huh .
It's simply unavoidable .
The trend is irreversible ,
The woman is invincible .
She's a natural law 
and she haves me in an awe .
She deserves the applause
I surrender because ...

Refrain

She used to look good to me ...


She's unavoidable -
I'm backed against the wall .
She gives me feelings
Like I've never felt before .
I'm breaking promises ,
She's breaking every law .

Refrain

She used to look good to me ...


Her methods are inscrutable :
The proof is irrefutable . Ooh , Ooh .
She's so completely kissable , huh.
Our lives are indivisable .

She's so fine - there's no telling
Where the money went , whoa 
She's all mine - there's no other
Way to go  , oh - oh .
