Intro
--------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUMENTAL
--------------------------------------------------------
Lost in the high street where the dogs run
roaming suburbian boys
mother's got her hairdo to be done
she says they're too old for toys
stood by the bus stop
with a felt pen in this suburbian hell
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain:
let's take a ride run with the dogs tonight in suburbia
/:you can't hide run with the dogs tonight in suburbia:\
--------------------------------------------------------
break a window by the town hall 
listen siren screams there in the distance
like a roll call of all suburban dreams
i only wanted something else to 
else to do but hang around
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain:
let's take a ride run with the dogs tonight in suburbia
you can't hide run with the dogs tonight 
in suburbia in suburbia in suburbiaa
--------------------------------------------------------
