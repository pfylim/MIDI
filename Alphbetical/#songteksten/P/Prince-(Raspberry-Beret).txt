Title  : Raspberry Beret
Singer : Prince


I was working part time in a five and dime
My boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times
That he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit 2 leisurely
Seems that I was busy
Doing something close 2 nothing
But different that the day before
That's when I saw her
She walked in through the out door

Chorus:
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind u find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her

Built like she was she had the nerve 2 ask me
If I planned 2 do her any harm
So I put her on the back of my bike
And we went riding down by old man Johnson's farm
Overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't 2 bright but I could tell
When she kissed me
She knew how 2 get her kicks

The rain sounds so cool
When It hist the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
Y feel like a movie star
They say the first time ain't the greatest
But if I had the chance 2 do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke 
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Chorus
