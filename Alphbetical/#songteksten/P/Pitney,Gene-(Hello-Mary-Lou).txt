       Hello Mary Lou       Gene Pitney


Hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

You passed me by one sunny day, 
flashed those big brown eyes my way
And I wanted you for ever more
Now I'm not one that gets around
I swear my feed stuck to the ground
And though I never did meet you before

Hey, hey, hello Mary Lou...

I saw your lips I heard your voice
Believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I thought about a moonlit night
My arms about you good an' tight
That's all I had to see for me to say

Hello Mary Lou...
