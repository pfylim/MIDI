Title  : GEORGIE

Georgie, your love reminds me of a song
When it's new you put it on
And it's refrain you remember

Georgie, but when the song's been often played
Another song that has been made
Makes you forget
What you liked the other day

Georgie, there was a time you played our love
Remember I'm not a record you can play
And turn it off

Georgie, like many songs you will return
Every minute I will yearn
And when it comes
You can see me standing there

Georgie, there was a time you played our love
Remember I'm not a record you can play
And turn it off

Georgie, like many songs you will return
Every minute I will yearn
And when it comes
You can see me standing there

Georgie, I'm telling you
I'll be standing there
To hold your hand
To kiss your lips
To say please love me
