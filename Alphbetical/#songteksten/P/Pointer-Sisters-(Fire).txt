Singer : POINTER SISTERS 
Title  : FIRE

(Words & music: Bruce Springsteen)

I'm riding in your car
You turn on the radio
You're pulling me close
I just say no
I say I don't like it
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss, ooh fire

Late at night
You're taking me home
You say you wanna stay
I say I wanna be alone
I say I don't love you
But you know I'm a liar
'Cause when we kiss ooh fire

You had a hold on me right from the start
A grip so tight we just couldn't tear it apart
My nerves are jumping, I feel like a fool
When your kisses they burn, my heart stays cool

Romeo and Juliet, Samson and Delilah
Baby you can bet, a love they couldn't deny
My word say split, but my words they lie
'Cause when we kiss ooh fire

Oh fire, our kiss is like fire
Burn me up with fire
I like what you're doing now, fire
Touching me with fire
Touching me burnin' me with fire
Take me home, fire, your kiss is like fire
