A WHITER SHADE OF PALE - PROCOL HARUM


We skipped the light fandango
and turned cart wheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
but the crowd called out for more.
The room was humming harder 
as the ceiling flew away
when we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray.
And so it was that later as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly turned a
whiter shade of pale.
She said there is no reason
and the truth is plain to see
but I wandered thro' my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixten vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might just as well been closed.
And so it was that later as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly turned a
whiter shade of pale.
