10. I SHOW YOU SECRETS - PHARAO

I SHOW YOU SECRETS OF YOUR LIFE
COME WITH ME TO THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC

CHORUS:
I SHOW YOU SECRETS OF YOUR LIFE
SECRETS OF YOUR MIND
THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC WILL FIND A WAY
ONE DAY
ONE DAY
(REPEAT)

1. RAP:
LET ME COME INSIDE YOUR MIND
WHAT'S THE MYSTERY I WILL FIND
IS IT LOVE OR IS IT TIME
IS IT YOURS OR IS IT MINE
LET ME FEEL
LET ME GIVE YOU THE RHYTHM
POSITION OF LOVE IS WHAT I'M FEELING INSIDE
QUICK, CATCH UP
BEFORE YOU LOSE ME
DON'T LOOK SO, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ME
GROWING UP
WHAT'S THE MYSTERY OF MUSIC
WILL IT FIND IT'S WAY
OR WILL IT LOSE IT
THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY
TO KNOW THE ANSWERS
HOLD YOUR HEAD IN THE RAIN, THINK FASTER
TIME IS RUNNING OUT, DO YOU KNOW
FEEL THE VIBE, SO WHY LET IT NOT GROW
OPEN YOUR HEART
FREE YOUR MIND, GIVE ME YOUR LOVE
AND FEEL THE RHYTHM LET GO

CHORUS

2. RAP:
TRY TO THINK
BUT MY MIND IT PONDERS
TRY THE REASON WITH
BUT I WONDER
WHAT'S THIS THING CALLED ANOTHER
DON'T FIND THE FEELING
LET THE SOUND TAKE OVER
ATMOSPHERE AROUND MY HEAD
OZONE, THE MUSIC'S TURNING ME WET
THOUGHTS OF PEACE, LOVE, UNITY
BUT NO ONE IN THE WORLD UNDERSTANDS ME
WHAT DO I DO, I LOSE CONTROL
NO, I GIVE MY RHYTHM MY SOUL
LET IT ASIDE, FIND A WAY
TO MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE
ONLY ONE WAY TO KNOW
WHAT'S TO DO IT
OPEN YOUR HEART, FREE YOUR MIND
GIVE YOUR SOUL TO THE MUSIC
JUST DO IT
AND FEEL THE VIBE

CHORUS
