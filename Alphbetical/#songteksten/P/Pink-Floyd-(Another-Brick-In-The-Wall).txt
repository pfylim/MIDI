1. ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL - PINK FLOYD

Refrain:
We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teachers leave us kids alone 
Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone! 
All in all it's just a-nother brick in the wall 
All in all you're just a-nother brick in the wall.

Refrain mit Kinderchor:
We don't need no education 
We don't need no thought control 
No dark sarcasm in the classroom 
Teacher, teacher, leave us kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone! 
All in all it's just a-nother brick in the wall 
All in all you're just a-nother brick in the wall.
