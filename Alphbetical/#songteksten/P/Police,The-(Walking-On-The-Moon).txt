Title  : WALKING ON THE MOON

(Words & music: Sting)

Giant steps are what you take
Walking on the moon
I hopemy legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could live together, walking on
Walking on the moon

Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
Walking back from your house
Walking on the moon
My feet don't hardly make no sound
Walking on, walking on the moon

Some may say I'm wishing my days away
No way
And if it's the price I pay, some day
Tomorrow another day
You stay, I might as well play
