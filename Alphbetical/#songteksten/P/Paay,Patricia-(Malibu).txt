Title  : MALIBU

(Words & music: John Volita/Patricia Paay)

Cruisin' all the boulevards
Your money came from playin' cards
And in one of those poker bars
You told me of the moon and stars
I was deceived by neon lights
When you spoke of rainbow nights
Makin' my life big and bright

Oh, you were born in Hollywood
In a mansion called 'the living's good'
You owned a racehorse-stable too
And a beach-house down in Malibu
It sounded too good to be true
But somehow I believed in you
And followed you

And I was so happy
Livin' in the sunshine
In Malibu
The sun was in our eyes
In our little paradise
I had the summer of my life
In Malibu

Chorus:
Malibu, Malibu, Malibu
I was so much in love with you
Malibu, too good to be true
Malibu, but I believed in you
Malibu, how I loved you

Then suddenly you had to go
For some business down in Mexico
You had no time to explain
But I could expect a little rain
Within an hour the police came
Leavin' me here filled with shame
Now Malibu is not the same

And I was so happy
Livin' in the sunshine, in Malibu
The sun was in our eyes
In our little paradise
I had the summer of my life
In Malibu

Chorus: ...
