Title  : JOHNNY & MARY
Artist : ROBERT PALMER

(Words & music: Robert Palmer)

Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm that he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls, knows he tires easily
Johnny thinks the world would be right
If it would buy truth from him
Mary says he changes his mind more than a woman
But she made her bet even when the chance was slim

Johnny says he's willing to learn when he decided he's a fool
Johnny says he'll live anywhere when he earns time to
Mary combs her hair, says she should be used to it
Mary always hedges her bets, she never knows what to think
She says that he still acts like he's being discovered
Scared that he'll be caught without a second thought

Johnny feels he's wasting his breath trying to talk sense to her
Mary says he's lacking a real sense of proportion
So she combs her hair, she knows he tires easily
Johnny's always running around, trying to find certainty
He needs all the world to confirm that he ain't lonely
Mary counts the walls, says she should be used to it
