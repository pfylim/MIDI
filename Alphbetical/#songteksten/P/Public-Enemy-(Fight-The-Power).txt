Title  : Fight The Power
Singer : Public Enemy


1989 a number, another summer!
Get down
Sound of the funky drummer!
Music hittin' you hard
Cause I know you got soul
Brothers and sisters
Listen if you're missin' y'all
Swingin' while I'm singin'
Giving what you getting
Knowin' what I'm knowin'
While the black man's sweatin'
In the rhythm I'm rollin'
Got to give us what we want!
Got to give us what we need!
Our freedom of speech is freedom of death
We got to fight for the powers that be

Chorus:
Fight the power! (6x)
We got to fight the powers that be

As the rhythm designed to bounce with ounce
Is that the rhythms' designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the prize of rap
We've got to pump the stuff that makes you tuff
From the heart it's a start
A work of art
To revolutionize make a change
Somethin' strange people! people!
We are the same 
No we're not the same
Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness
We can't get careless
You say "What is this?"
My beloved lets get down to business
Mental self defense of fitness
Bum rush the show!
You got to go for what you know!
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

Chorus (2x)Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me
Ya see straight out racist the sucka was simple and plain
Mother fuck him and John Wayne
Cause I'm black and I'm proud, I'm ready
I'm hyped, plus I'm able
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamp
Sample a book that you look
And find nothin' but rednecks
For 400 years if you check
Don't worry be happy was a number one jam
Damn if I say it, you can slap me right here, get it,
Let's get this party started right - right on - come on
What we got to say, power to the people no delay
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be

Chorus
