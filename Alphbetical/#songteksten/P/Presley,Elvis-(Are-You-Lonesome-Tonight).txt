Title  : ARE YOU LONESOME TONIGHT
Artist : ELVIS PRESLEY

(Words & music: Roy Turk/Lou Handman)

Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does you memory stray
To a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlour seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know, someone said: The world's a stage
And each must play a part
Faith had me playing in love
With you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at fist glance

You read your lines so cleverly 
And never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why I'll never know

Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies 
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
with emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can ring the curtain down

Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight
