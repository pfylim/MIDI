<A NAME="1"><H2>WHEN IT ALL BEGAN</H2><P>
<PRE>
(R. Furay, S. Sellen, S. Pasch, M. Krizan)

I remember the feeling, not so long ago
The kids came dancin', their hearts were romancin'
And the music was live Poco
Some called it country, some called it rock and roll
But whatever the sound, it was sure to be found
With a heart, rhythm and soul

 Chorus:
Do you remember then, how it was when it all began
Do you remember then, how the music made you feel, when it all began
Ooh do you remember when, when it all began, ooh do you remember when

New York and Boston, yeah we sure had some fun
Summer nights in the park, and when the music would start
Ooh what a time and then some
We sang together, "a good feelin' to know"
Yeah we turned it up loud, gave our hearts to the crowd
But then came the end of the show

(chorus)

To capture the moment, to make it ours for all time
I know we can just remember how it was, when it all began

(Solo)

Oh now do, do you remember when - how the music played
Ooh, do you remember when - when it all began
Oh now ooh, do you remember when, oh now ooh, do you remember when
Do you remember, do you remember when, do you remember...  (to fade)

<A NAME="2"><H2>CALL IT LOVE</H2><P>
<PRE>
(R. Guilbeau, B. Crain, R. Lonow, J. Messina)

We've got all night, let's take our time
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
When it makes us feel better, call it love

You say you won't, I say you will
You make me crazy, but I want you still
When it makes us feel better, call it love

 Chorus:
Do we tell the truth, or do we live a lie
Is the feeling good, is that what makes you cry
When you say those words, look me in the eye
Tell me why you call it love

I play my hand, you call my bluff
We push each other, 'til we've had enough
When it's all you've got, call it love

If I didn't have money, would you want me still
When you look real close, do we fit the bill
Call it what you want, but only time will tell

(chorus)

(Solo)

We've got all night, let's take our time

When it's all you've got, call it love

<A NAME="3"><H2>THE NATURE OF LOVE</H2><P>
<PRE>
(J. Silbar, V. Stephenson)

You think you've got it in the palm of your hand
Then it slips through your fingers like a grain of sand
You're blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

 Chorus:
Oh-oh, it's famine or feast, that's the nature of the beast
Screams like an eagle, cries like a dove, oh-oh, that's the nature of love

Now some will find it on their wedding day
Some will never give their hearts away
It can be so cold you, think you're gonna freeze
Or burn you up like a slow disease

(chorus) - the nature of love

(Solo)

Like blood in the water to a hungry shark
It slips in silent then it rips you apart

(chorus repeats 2x)

That's the nature of love, that's the nature of love, the nature of love
Screams like an eagle, cries like a dove, that's the nature of love...

<PRE>
(R. Young)

I know I'm in over my head, I'm walkin' a fine line
Tryin' not to be the one who falls in and out this time
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray
I'm not gonna worry now, tomorrow's too far away

 Chorus:
When people say that it can never last, heaven will just slip out of our grasp
People don't believe a day goes by, we don't end up saying our goodbyes
What do people know, what do people know

There's always been a chance you and I won't last forever
We've been in and out of love before, I'll never say never
I'm just gonna hold my breath, close my eyes and pray
I'm not gonna worry now, tomorrow's too far away

(chorus repeats 2x)

What do people know, what do people know, what do people know

<A NAME="5"><H2>NOTHIN' TO HIDE</H2><P>
<PRE>
(R. Marx, B. Gaitsch)

Cryin' doesn't ease the pain
When the fire is gone, when the weak break the strong
There's no danger, when a heart is cold
But if I stay alone, mine will soon turn to stone

I know - girl you're not the only one - who's looking for someone to hold

 Chorus:
The look in your eyes ain't the same anymore
Something has changed deep inside
We both know it's right, what are we waiting for
There's no holding back, 'cause with you I've got nothin' to hide

Sleepin' on a bed of lies
I've been lonely too long, now the hurt is all gone
You were waiting for me to come around
How could I be so blind, not to see in your mind

And your heart - you've always been the only one - believin' in me all along

Girl - (chorus)

(Solo)

Girl - (chorus)

<A NAME="6"><H2>LOOK WITHIN</H2><P>
<PRE>
(J. Messina)

When you're down, and feelin' low, and there ain't nobody, and no place to go
Don't feel alone, 'cause you have a friend, look within, look within

So many times, we go astray, and we need somebody to show us the way
Don't be afraid, 'cause you have a friend, look within, look within

 Chorus:
Within every soul, there was left the seeds of need
As in the soil of the earth, they are concealed
Prayer is the rain, to make 'em grow
Water them well, and they shall yield

Don't feel sad, and don't be blue, there is somebody waitin' on you
Open your heart, 'cause you have a friend, look within, look within

(Solo)

(chorus)

So don't feel sad, and don't be blue, there is somebody waitin' on you
Open your heart, 'cause you have a friend, look within, look within

Look within, look within, open your heart, baby now look within
Open your heart, let that love light shine within
Open your heart, baby now look within
Open up, I said open up, open up and let that love light in...  (to fade)

<PRE>
(R. Young, R. Foster, B. Lloyd)

If I had my way tonight, I would surely change your mind
You might be surprised at what you see
I know I don't look the part, don't turn it off before it starts
I can hear your heart talkin' to me

 Chorus:
I'm not a stone that's been polished and shined
I'm not the diamond that you had in mind
I can't hide it, you get what you see
I've got a lot of rough edges on me

Carnegie or Albert Hall, you don't need no crystal ball
You know you'll never catch me in that scene
I like my music way up loud, the house is rockin' when I go out
The midnight hour that's where I want to be

(R. Young, M. Noble)

Chorus:
Who else has your heart tonight, who else (who else)
Who else stays awake all night, who else

If a picture says a thousand words, you don't have to say a thing
'Cause I can see it in those big green eyes
You can't hide what you can't explain - it's right there in your eyes

(chorus)

I hear a whisper softly in my ear, a little voice that tries to say
Don't let her go now, she's so good for you
You'd be a fool to let her walk away - don't let her walk away

<PRE>
(J. Messina, M. Brady)

Oh the world has got its problems, they're comin' into view
And girl I know that we will surely do what we can do
But while we're in the midst of changing darkness into light
Gonna be beside you, to keep you warm at night

And I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day

Oh, now recently it's clear to me, what makes the world uptight
Is the lack of joy we have, for the love of what feels right
But you and I are makin' the change, along with all our friends
And it feels so good to let you know, for me it all begins

When I'm lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day
I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day

(Solo)

Ohh, jobs are gettin' fewer, and the rents are on the rise
When I look at what it costs to live, I can't believe my eyes
But you and I are not alone, the whole world is feelin' it too
And I'm gonna do the best I can, and while I'm here with you

I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day
I'll be lovin' you baby, lovin' you every minute of the day

Yeah, lovin' you, I'll be lovin' you baby, I'll be lovin' you every minute

<A NAME="10"><H2>IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU</H2><P>
<PRE>
(R. Furay, S. Sellen)

It's hard to see myself out there alone
People starin' 'cause I got no home
Nowhere to lay my head, so I just walk on
Searchin' for somethin', daylight 'til dawn

When I had taken about all I could take, oh no, where's my life goin'
Livin' blindly to the difference you'd make
Your love was tender but strong, you were there all along

 Chorus:
If it wasn't for you - there'd be no one to make me try
If it wasn't for you - I'd just stand here and cry
If it wasn't for you - who would care if I lived or died
If it wasn't for you, now I know I'll get through

I don't know how it got to be this way
The hope of life just seemed to slip away
Can I find the strength to face another day
I can't pretend now, want it to end now

When I had taken about all I could take, oh no, where's my life goin'
Livin' blindly to the difference you'd make
Your love was tender but strong, you were there all along

(chorus)

(Solo)

If it wasn't for you - who could I turn to - if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you - I'd feel my heart break in two
If it wasn't for you - yeah, what would I do

<A NAME="11"><H2>FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS</H2><P>
<PRE>
(J. Messina)

There are images around us, in everything we see
Some are real and some are fantasy
To the one who sees his vision, to the child who lives his dreams
You're the one to decide what you're gonna be

Chorus:
So give it your best, and don't worry about what some may say
Follow your dreams, it's really all that you can do
Give it your best, and remember that life is what you choose
Follow your dreams, and do what you love to do

There are places you'll remember, and times you may recall
Faces that refresh your memory
May the thoughts that you will picture, help you come to see
That you're the one to decide what you're gonna be

(chorus)

(Solo)

So give it your best, and don't worry about what some may say
Follow your dreams, it's really all that you can do
And give it your best, and remember that life is what you choose
Go on, follow your dreams and do it, follow your dreams and do it
Follow your dreams, and do what you love to do, what you love to do
