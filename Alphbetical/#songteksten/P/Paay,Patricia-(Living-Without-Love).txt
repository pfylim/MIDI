Title  : LIVING WITHOUT YOU

(Words & music: A. Mol/G. Hessing/L. Flint/C. Bergman/ E.Veerhoff/E.
v. Prehn)

Living without you, the heartaches come over
Living without you, I'm losing my mind
'Cause all that's left is a name in a tree
A part of dream you stole from me
Loving without you, the snow is falling
Loving without you, the winter has come

You used to play the funny clown
You cheered me up when I was down

Chorus:
Do it what you wanna do
Life seems so easy when you
Do it what you wanna do
And now I realize, it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over

Loving without you, they said you were leaving
Living without you, you left me alone
You always were my best friend
You know, first love comes to an end

Chorus: ...

When you do it, you wanna do
Life seems so easy when you do it
What you wanna do and now I realize
It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over
