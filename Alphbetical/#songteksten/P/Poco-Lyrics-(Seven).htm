<A NAME="1"><H2>DRIVIN' WHEEL</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

We were setting in the harbor
With our sights out on the land
There was something someone or other
That we couldn't quite understand
About the driving wheel
Want to know how it feels
To be taking time out turn it all about
Taking hold the drivin'

Thre were miles of time drowned
In the wine
We were talkin' 'bout better days
It was years ago when we pelt the goal
Was anchored to the changing ways

There ain't nothin' here only the fear of
What is right and what is real
Satisfaction smile come on board
For a while
We're taking hold of the drivin' wheel

We were set in the harbor
Had our sights on the land
All the men at the wheel moving on
With the plan
We were reaching tohether for
The same end
Sunshiny weather comin' 'round
The bend

<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

Bow to the fiddler
Don't be slow
Smoke on the mountain
Fire on the bow

Pick out the tunewe
Love to hear
Patch up the feelin's
Mend all the fear

Oh, what a showdown
Toe to toe
First one to holler
Last one to go

Now change your partners
Clap your hands
Stomp your feet
At the new barn dance

Ooh, stealin'
Colorado reelin'
Rocky Mountain Breakdown

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit/Noreen Schmit)

Just call my name
Baby can't you see something's wrong?
Ain't it a shame
All those old time feeling's gone?
Right or wrong
I know it takes us all so long to realize
How we just get ourselves so lost
in our lies
There's no time to cry.

You hold me near
I don't even need to be told
I feel your touch
And it brings a chill to my soul
Your love is cold
How do you live with all your secrets
And lies?
How does it feel to live a life of disguise
Yoy know it ain't right?

Hey, it ain't right
I keep telling you
It ain't right
When you're teasing
There's a light
If you can reach it
It starts when you think it's the end

Just call my name
Baby can't you see what we've done?
You turn and hide
Don't you know that I want to run?
See the sun
We've tried so many times
You know that it's true
I'm asking what more do you want
Me to do
When it's all up to you -

Hey, it ain't right
I keep telling you
It ain't right
When you're teasing
There's a light
If you can reach it
It starts when you think it's the end.

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Taking it easy
Wasting my time everywhere I go
Then you try to please me
Telling me things I already know
Think I'm going on a vacation
Slippin' on my shoes
Do I need an explanation,
One that I can use?
But I know - That it shows - Here I go

Skatin'...Oh -
Skatin'...Over the water
Skatin'...Through my heart,
Through my heart I go

I can't deny it
Giving is such an easy task
You just got to try it
'stead of wondering what you're
Gonna ask
Outside my window it's freezin'
And the day is new
Tell myself that I believe in
What I know ain't true
Yes I do know - That it shows - Here I go

Skatin'...Oh -
Skatin'...Over the water
Skatin'...Through my heart,
Through my heart I go

What good does it do for me to say
You're going nowhere?
On the lake the ice will pave your way
Leave it all behind just to get there

Skatin'...Oh -
Skatin'...Over the water
Skatin'...Through my heart,
Through my heart I go

<A NAME="5"><H2>FAITH IN THE FAMILIES</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Taking the dream how we ran
In the rage of another plan
Heading for the mountain wall
Where it all began to fall
When we heard the wind call

Take your homes in the sun
There ain't no need to run
You've been here you've been there
You've been everywhere
And the time has come to really care

Through our families we had eyes to see
What could really be
We were making plans in the
Promise land
Far away from the shining sea

For some it wasn't easy
Living in an old dream
There's so many rocks in the stream
Do you know what I mean

We are living in a time that is ours
To share
Catch up don't you stray too far behind
For the time has come for us
To really care
Would you trade me your dream
For mine

Taking the dream how we ran
In the rage of another plan
Heading for the mountain wall
Where it all began to fall
When we heard the wind call

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Passing through I bring love to you
Let me see your smile
Though it seems so untrue, I'm standing
Right here beside you
Can I stay a while

I been too long feeling kinda low
Help me to follow through
From the start
'cause I can't seem to find a way to go
Is it for me to know my mind
In a place that holds no time
For a little while
'cause soon we must part

Passing through I bring love to you
Let me see your smile
Though it seems so untrue, I'm standing
Right here beside you
Can I stay a while

Firefly dance for you and I, and don't go
Leaving us hollow through
From the start
'cause moonlight don't seem right
When you're alone
Is it for you to know my mind
With a hope that you might find
Me with you sometime
But, soon we must part

Passing through I bring love to you
Let me see your smile
Though it seems so untrue, I'm standing
Right here beside you
Can I stay a while

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Pleasure seeker new love reaper
I've heard tell you're quite
A nighttime keeper
Will you ever find the sun
Maybe never in a ten-day run

Painted faces forgotten bootlaces
Ain't it all the same in the
Brand-new places
So we dance between the lights
Taking a chance to make it right -
Make it right

Na na na na na na -- oh oh oh

She's an angel and she loves to
Spread her wings
I'm a stranger here but I love
the song she sings
Heaven knows that I can feel you
And all the ways that you
Come on through
My lady blue

Na na na...

<A NAME="8"><H2>YOU'VE GOT YOUR REASONS</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

You've got your reasons
Like the seasons they change
Talking of pleasure
While enjoying the pain


And though it keeps you in the light
And all the words are said just right
There's still a cry in the night

Up on the mountain
Through the snow-covered hills
Taken for granted
You can get all your fill

And if I seem to look away
And turn the pages of the play
There are these things I have to say

I'm a springtime boy and I look
For the joy
Of a world in bloom could it come
Never too soon
And while the world is turning
And the sun is burning
Do you think in my yearning that
The journey is through
I can't leave it up to you

And though it keeps you in the light
And all the words are said just right
There's still a cry in the night
