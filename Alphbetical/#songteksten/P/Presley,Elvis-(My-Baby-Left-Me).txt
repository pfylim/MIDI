Yes, my baby left me, never said a word.
Was it something I done, something that she heard ?
My baby left me, my baby left me.
My baby even left me, never said a word.

Now, I stand at my window, wring my hands and cry.
I hate to lose that woman, hate to say good-bye.
You know she left me, yes, she left me.
My baby even left me, never said a word.
