
8. Know By Now - Robert Palmer

You ought to know by now.

Baby, when our hearts awoke
Think of all the rules that broke
In the name of love we hoped
Little did we know
Darling, all the time we spent
Ignoring all the consequences
And hiding from the evidence
Hoping things would change
But the girl in you
Like the loneliness of a castle gloom
To be near to you
Was the only thing
In my heart each day
Keeping me alive
Till your rescue came.

Honey, you mean everything to me.

You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness.

What you're thinking spend in vain
What to lose and what to gain
All the guilt and all the pain
Seem to come our way
And baby when our hearts awoke
Think of all the rules we broke
In the name of love we spoke
Little did we know.

But the hope was there
Like a raised sun on a cloudy day
And a change from impossibility
To the only world
Love can conquer all
And it's here to stay.

Honey, you mean everything to me.

You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness
You ought to know by now
Love means everything
You ought to know by now
Only love can bring happiness
You ought to know by now.

You ought to know by now
You ought to know by now.
