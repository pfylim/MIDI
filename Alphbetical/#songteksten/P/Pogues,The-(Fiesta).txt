THE POGUES - FIESTA

(Words & music: S. MacGowan/J. Finer)

I am Francesco Vasquez Garcia
I am welcome to Almeria
We have sin gas and con leche
We have fiesta and fiera
We have the song of the chochona
We have brandy and half corona
And Leonardo and his accordione
And calamari and macaroni

Refrain:
Come all you rambling boys of pleasure
And ladies of easy leisure
We must say adios until we see
Almeria once again

There is a minstrel there you see
And he stoppeth one in three
He whispers in this one's ear
Will yo unkindly kill that doll for me
We must forgive him that Senor Fearnley
He does the dance of the British Navy
He has defiled a young girl from Granada
He must be counted among the emplasada

Wooh wooh wooh
El veinticinco de agosto
Abrio sus ojos Jamie Fearnley
Pero el bebe cinquante gin campara
Y se tenio para cerrarlos
Y Costello el rey del America
Y suntuosa Cait O'Riordan
Non rompere mes colliones
Los gritos fuera de las casas
