(K. Johnson/R. Furay)

It comes from the backwoods of meadows and memories
Sunshine encasted in honey sweet rhymes
That linger so gently in rustic illusions
To whittle your ears to the sound of the times

(Richie. Furay)

It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
Hey, it's such a lovely day
Smile, a frown would be passé
I wanna play
Oh, What A Day

I've got to dream
I can't find a reason to care
And it seems
I hung all my thoughts in mid-air
Look over there
Oh, stop and stare

It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
What did you say?
It's a wonderful day

It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
Hey, it's such a lovely day
Oh, smile, a frown would just be passé
I wanna play
Oh, What A Day

It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine

(Richie. Furay)

Baby, you can see that it's a lie
What he said to you
Made you sad, kind of made me glad
'Cause I got the same from you

I ain't your fool, you'd better go away
Don't apologize
No words you'd say wouldn't be okay
I'm through listenin' to your lies

You thought I'd be here, you came back
You were so darn sure of yourself
But just look around, see it ain't so
You'd better start lookin' for help

So many times you stood and laughed at me
Now I'll take my turn
You've had your way up until today
Guess that it's time you learned

'Cause I got the same from you

<PRE>
(Richie Furay/Jim Messina)

Silken-soft she rises from the dawn, child of spring
I've known her, oh, for so long
Creature of the earth but never to be wed
She's far too high for mortal's bed
So touch her now and love her while you can
Soon she'll travel on and join the wind

Often she'll be there as you are falling through your eyes
Revisiting some place in the past
And she leads you softly to the limits of your world
But you'll only see her face in a glass
Staring back with eyes that cannot see you
And yet you wish that yours were just as good

So touch her now and love her while you can
Soon she'll travel on and join the wind
Soon she'll travel on and join the wind
Soon she'll travel on and join the wind

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Today my First Love has arrived
Did you see her? Did you approve?
What if I asked this of you?
Would everything you'd say be true?

When I was young I played with toys
Games were small then, not so involved
My toys meant most of all
You know how kids are when they're small

But now today I find a lot has come to change my mind
It took some time to understand
Older people play little games in another way
Their castles crumble to sand
A lonely hour to withstand

Today my First Love is alone
Do you miss her? Is it so sad?
The tears you cry should be glad
Remembering her is not all that bad

Today my First Love is alone

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Maybe someday I can trade you a smile
Makin' love a dream that's worthwhile
I've been watchin' you like a mother and child
What you're feelin', oh
What you're feelin'
Please Make Me A Smile

Yellow ribbons stream through your hair
Such a feelin', now, don't leave me there
You make it so hard for me not to stare
What you're feelin', oh
What you're feelin'
Please make me aware

BRIDGE:
Lover, come on, I can see suddenly
Changes in you, you're smilin' at me
Lover, belong only to me
Arrange your sweet tune to make harmony

Short Changed
I got to hand it to you
Bloodstained
My hands were tied 'cause of you
Can you feel the pulse of my soul drivin' you home
Isn't it lonely
Tryin' to think back over the times when my love was all
And you didn't know me

My friend
Your scheme was so well devised
Sufferin'
What was behind your disguise
Can you feel the pulse of my soul drivin' you home
Isn't it lonely
Tryin' to think back over the times when my love was all
And you didn't know me

Short Changed
I got to hand it to you
Bloodstained
My hands were tied 'cause of you
Can you feel the pulse of my soul drivin' you home
Isn't it lonely
Tryin' to think back over the times when my love was all
And you didn't know me

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Well there's just a little bit of magic
In the country music we're singin'
So let's begin
We're bringin' you back down home where the folks are happy
Sittin' pickin' and a-grinnin'
Casually, you and me
We'll Pick Up The Pieces, uh-huh

Somebody yelled out at me (Hey!)
Country music and company kind of makes it
On a Sunday afternoon
Picnic lunches of yesterday
Should still have a place in your heart today
Think it over
'Cause we'll all be goin' home so soon

(Repeat first verse)

If you had the time to stay
Would you sit yourself down and play country music
Singin' songs that we both knew
Lord I know that the day will come
When the both of us will sit down and strum
On our guitars
And you'll see I really am a lot like you

<PRE>
(Jim Messina)

Bein' at most just a country boy innocent and all
I turned my face away from the farm, on the city I'd call
Hey, what's doin' in the town of fortune and fame?
Bright lights a-glowin', I've come to make my name

You see I've got my ol' guitar, I'm not a beggin' fool
I play this town and a thousand more (God knows)
God knows I keep my cool
So what's missin'? I've given my world the best
And I'm downright grateful, for Oh Yeah, my life's been blessed

CHORUS
My my, can't you see the warnin'
When the fires burn you better pay
Oh Yeah it's gonna get you in the mornin'
Now's your chance you better get away

Stayed awake 'most all last night, just couldn't get to sleep
So many things sittin' on my brain, yes, I need a chance to think
But I've been told not to worry, everything's gonna be all right
Oh, mama, won't you tell me, why did I leave that night?

Seems like it's been ages ago now since I come to town
Ain't much changed, every face is the same
Oh, people just a-hangin' round
So I'm a-leavin' this mornin', gonna go back home today
And let me tell you, buddy, turn around if you're fixin' to stay
You better go on home today

What does it matter to me that you've gone
The memory's all in a dream
And though it seems I ought to be
With a good night's yawn, the heartache is gone
Yes Indeed

For lovin' you I have been such a fool
Hardly knowin' the game or the rules
Nothin' for me could I see except for your teasin'
I guess I was just dreamin'
Holdin' onto promises from you

(Repeat first verse)

Just In Case It Happens, you see
I have paid all my dues faithfully
Now the peace of mind I feel inside is worth the misgivings
There's a new beginning clingin' in my head
The rest of it's been said

<PRE>
(Skip Goodwin/Richie Furay)

Tomorrow
Always bring
Raindrumming on my
Window pane
As the skies
Unleash their tears
And darkened cloud
Release their fears
Washing clean
The festering earth
It foretells
Of a renesance

And in the thrill of it's rebirth
Flowers wait to creep the dawn
Childishin' their innocence
Laughing out tomorrow gone

Tomorrow
Always brings
Rain ah, but soon the sun
Will shine again
Looking home while you and I
Walk along
Wondering why
Noin' you're lovin' me fortells
Of renesance

(Skip Goodwin/Richie Furay)

It's been a long time a comin'
And I have to carry on
It's been a lomg time a comin'
But now you're gone

Oh, look at me
Sittin' starin' at the rain
Knowin' the days that we once new
Won't ever come again
Well it seems to strange to really be
So I pinch myself and I find
Oh, yeah, it's me

It's been a long time a comin'
And I have to carry on
It's been a lomg time a comin'
But now you're gone

And it's to late to turn
Back all the clocks in town
It's to late take the x
From yesterday
Now the die is cast
Nothin' happens in the past
So I'll think I'll take a walk
Out in the rain

Oh, here I go
Walkin' down the street in time
Never knowin' though I'm tryin' to keep myself in rhyme
Just a while has now become to long
Consequently to you I can say
Goodbye, so long

It's been a long time a comin'
And I have to carry on
It's been a lomg time a comin'
But now you're gone

And it's to late to turn
Back all the clocks in town
It's to late take the x
From yesterday
Now the die is cast
Nothin' happens in the past
So I'll think I'll take a walk
Out in the rain

Oh, here I go
Walkin' down the street in time
Never knowin' though I'm tryin' to keep myself in rhyme
Just a while has now become to long
Consequently to you I can say
Goodbye, so long

It's been a long time a comin'
And I have to carry on
It's been a lomg time a comin'
But now you're gone
But now you're gone
But now you're gone

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Thought a girl was a girl and then
I found myself in love again.
Yes, I've been in love a time or two
But it never happened like it did with you.
Do you feel it, too?

Yea, my heart just went for a ride
Certain feelings you just can't hide
About the ways of the girls, ah,
   but not like you.
Baby, do you feel it, too?

Please remember how
I feel about you.
Let me know right now
That I'm pleasing you.
