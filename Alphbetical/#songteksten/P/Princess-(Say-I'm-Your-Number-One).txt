PRINCESS - SAY I'M YOUR NUMBER ONE

They say I'm crazy
They say that I'm a fool
And I feel so helpless, because
love can be so cruel
But I'm just waiting
And burning up inside
Come tomorrow, come tomorrow
Will you you still be mine?

Refrain:
Say I'm your number one
I only want to be close to you
Say I'm your number one
Cos you know I'll be good to you
Say I'm your number one

You may be tempted
And sometimes lead astray
But I know, but I know
You'd regret it, the very next day
I sit and wonder
Whenever we're apart
Would you do it, would you do it
Would you go and break my heart?

Refrain: ...

Tell me there's no one else you'd
say that to
Cos I'd forgive anything you do
Tell me that nobody else will do
I only want to be with you

Refrain: ...
