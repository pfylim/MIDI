ELAINE PAGE & BARBARA DICKSON - I KNOW HIM SO WELL

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
Wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back I could have played it differently
Won a few moments more who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well

Wasn't it good oh so good
(Wasn't he fine) oh so fine
(Isn't it madness) he can't be mine
(But in the end he needs a little bit more
than me more security)
He needs his fantasy and freedom
(I know him so well)

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back I could have played it differently
(Looking back I could have played things some
other way)
Learned about the man before I fell
(I was just a little careless maybe)
(I was so much younger then)
But I was ever so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well

Wasn't it good (oh so good)
Wasn't he fine (oh so fine)
Isn't it madness he won't be mine
Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start why am I falling apart
(Wasn't it good) wasn't he fine
(Isn't it madness) he won't be mine
(But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
more security)
He needs his fantasy and freedom
(I know him so well) It took time to understand him
I know him so well
