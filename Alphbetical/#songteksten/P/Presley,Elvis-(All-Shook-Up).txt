A-well-a, Bless my soul, what's wrong with me ?
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree.
My friends says I'm acting queer as a bug,
I'm in love, I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !

My hands are shaky and my knees are weak,
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet.
Who do you thank when have such luck ?
I'm in love, I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !

Please don't ask what's on my mind ,
I'm a little mixed up but I'm feelin' fine.
When I'm near that girl that I love best,
my heart beats so it scares me to death !
She touched my hand, what a chill I got,
her kisses are like a volcano that's hot !
I'm proud to say she's my butter cup,
I'm in love, I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !

My tongue gets tied when I triy to speak,
my inside shakes like a leaf on a tree,
there's only one cure for this soul of mine,
that's to have that girl that I love so fine.
She touched my hand, what a chill I got,
her kisses are like a volcano that's hot !
I'm proud to say she's my butter cup,
I'm in love, I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !
I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !
I'm all shook up ! 
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah !
I'm all shook up !
