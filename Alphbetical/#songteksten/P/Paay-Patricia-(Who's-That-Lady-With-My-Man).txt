Title  : WHO'S THAT LADY WITH MY MAN

(Words & music: R. Danova/D. Howman/G. Dare)

Who's that lady with my man
Who can she be, wooh wooh wooh wooh
With my man
What she's doing with my man
What can he see wooh wooh wooh wooh
With my man

He wouldn't, she wouldn't
He wouldn't, she shouldn't
Why should he do this to me
I hate him for lying
I hate her for trying
To steel my man from me

Don't do it, don't do it
Don't take this other lover
How could you, how could you
How could you love another

Don't do it, don't do it
I love you, I'll love you tonight
Will be fine
I'll be yours you'll be mine tonight

Ooh ooh ooh ooh tonight
I'll be your lover
Ooh ooh ooh ooh tonight
What's the matter with my man
What can it be, wooh wooh wooh wooh
With my man
I've done everything I can
What's wrong with me
Wooh wooh wooh wooh, with my man
