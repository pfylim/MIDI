Title  : BABY COME BACK

(Words & music: P. Beckett/ J.C. Crowley)

Spending all my nights
All my money, going out on the town
Doin' anything
Just to get you off my mind
And when the morning comes
I'm right back where I started again
And tryin' to forget you
Is just a waste of time

Chorus:
Baby come back
Any kind of fool could see
There was something
In everything about you
Baby come back
You can blame it all on me
I was wrong
And I just can't live without you

All day long
I'm wearing a mask of false provado
Trying to keep up a smile
That hides a tear
But as the sun goes down
I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God
That you were here

Chorus: ...

Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
That you used up
All the love in your heart
Nothing left for me
Ain't there nothing left for me?

Chorus: ...

I was wrong
And I just can't live

Chorus: ...
