
5. LIBERATION - PET SHOP BOYS

TAKE MY HAND
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND AGAIN
REALLY, I'VE BELIEVED IT TRUE
THAT ALL THAT FELL IN LOVE WERE FOOLISH

BUT I WAS WRONG
I'VE LEARNED THAT LESSON WELL
ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AT MIDNIGHT
YOU WERE SLEEPING ON MY SHOULDER

CHORUS:
TAKE MY HAND
DON'T THINK OF OBLIGATIONS
NOW, RIGHT NOW
YOUR IS LIBERATION

TO FREE IN ME
THE TRUST I'VE NEVER DEALT
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT THE RISK TOO GREAT
BUT SUDDENLY I DON'T HESITATE

TAKE MY HAND
DON'T THINK OF COMPLICATIONS
NOW, RIGHT NOW
YOUR LOVE IS LIBERATION

LIBERATION
TA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
TA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA

THE NIGHT, THE STARS,
OUR LIGHT SHONE THROUGH THE DARK
ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AT MIDNIGHT
YOU WERE SLEEPING ON MY SHOULDER

TAKE MY HAND
DON'T THINK OF HESITATION
NOW, RIGHT NOW
YOUR LOVE IS LIBERATION

LIBERATION
TA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA
TA-RA-RA-RA-RA-RA

BACK HOME AT MIDNIGHT
ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AT MIDNIGHT
