      Blue Suede Shoes           Elvis Presley 


Well it's one for the money , two for the show 
Three to get ready , now go , cat , go !
But don't you ... step on my Blue Suede Shoes
You can do anything 
But lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well you can knock me down , step in my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But uuh , honey lay off of my shoes
So don't you ...

Burn my house , steal my car
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you wanna do ...

Refrain 

Blue , blue , blue suede shoes ...
You can do anything 
But lay off of my blue suede shoes
