Since my baby left me, found new place to dwell.
Down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel.
I get so lonely baby,
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely I could die.

Although it's always crowded,
still can find some room,
Where those broken hearted lovers cry away their gloom, oh !
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely,
get so lonely I could die.

Bell hop's tears keep flowing, desk clerk's dressed in black.
They been so long on Lonely Street
they ain't never gonn' come back, oh !
I get so lonely,
I get so lonely,
get so lonely I could die.
