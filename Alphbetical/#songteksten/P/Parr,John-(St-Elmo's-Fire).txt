JOHN PARR - ST ELMO'S FIRE

Growing up, you don't see the writing on the wall
Passing by, moving straight ahead you knew it all
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain
You'll find you're all alone everything has changed
Play the game
You know you can't quit until it's won
Soldier on, only you can do what must be done
You know in some way you're a lot like me
You're just a prisoner and you're trying to break free

Refrain:
I can see a new horizon
underneath a blazing sky
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher
Gonna be a man in motion all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lying St. Elmo's Fire

Burning up, don't you know just how far that I can go
(just how far I go)
Soon be home only just a few miles down the road
I can make it I know I can
You broke the boy in me but you won't break the man

Refrain: ...

I can climb the highest mountain cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire burning in me burning in me

Just once in his life a man has his time
And my time is now I'm coming alive

I can hear the music playing I can see the banners fly
Feel like a man again I'll hold my head high
Gonna be a man in motion all I need's this pair of wheels
Take me where my future's lying St. Elmo's Fire

Refrain: ...

I can climb the highest mountain cross the wildest sea
I can feel St. Elmo's Fire burning in me burning
Burning in me, I can feel it burning
