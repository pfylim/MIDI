PET SHOP BOYS - IT'S ALRIGHT

(Words & music: Stirling Void)

Dictation being forced in Afghanistan
Revolution in South Africa taking a stand
People in Eurasia on the brink of oppression
I hope it's going to be alright
I hope the music plays forever

Forests falling at a desperate pace
The earth is dying
And desert taking its place
People under pressure
On the brink of starvation
I hope it's gonna be alright

Alright, alright
Alright 'cause the music plays forever
I hope it's gonna be alright
And the music plays forever
Alright, alright

Generations will come and go
But there's one thing for sure
Music is one life's foundation
And shall succeed all the nations to come

Alright, alright
Alright 'cause the music plays forever
I hope it's gonna be alright
And the music plays forever
Alright, alright

The year three thousand
May still come to pass
But the music shaw last
I can hear it on a timeless wave length
Never dissipating
But giving us strength

It's alright
I think it's gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
'Cause the music plays forever
