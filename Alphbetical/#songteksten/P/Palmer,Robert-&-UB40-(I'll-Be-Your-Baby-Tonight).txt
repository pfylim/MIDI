Title  : I'll Be Your Baby Tonight
Singer : Robert Palmer & UB40


Shut the light - shut the shade
You don't have to be afraid
I'll be your baby tonight
Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
We're gonna let it - you won't regret it
Kick your shoes off - do not fear 
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight
Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
We're gonna forget it
Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
We're gonna let it - you won't regret it
Kick your shoes of - do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I'll be your baby tonight (3x)
