3. LEARNING TO FLY - TOM PETTY

Well I started out 
Down a dirty road.
Started out all alone.
And the sun went down 
As I crossed the hill
And the town lit up, 
The world got still.

Chorus
I'm learning to fly, 
But I ain't got wings.
Coming down is the hardest thing.

Well the good ol' days may not return
And the rocks might melt 
And the sea may burn

Chorus

Well some say life will beat you down
Break your heart, steal your crown
So I've started out for God knows where
I guess I'll know when I get there

I'm learning to fly, around the clouds.
But what goes up must come down.

Chorus

I'm learning to fly, around the clouds.
But what goes up must come down.
I`m learning to fly.
I`m learning to fly.
