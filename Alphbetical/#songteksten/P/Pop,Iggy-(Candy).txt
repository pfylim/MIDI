Title  : Candy
Singer : Iggy Pop


It's a rainy afternoon in 1990
The big city geez it's been 20 years
Candy - you were so fine
Beautiful beautiful girl from the north
You burned my heart with a flickering torch
I had a dream that no one else could see
You gave me love for free
Candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me 
I loved you so
Candy I can't let you go
Life is crazy, Candy baby
Yeah, well it hurt me real bad when you left
I'm glad you got out but I miss you 
I've had a hole in my heart for so long
I've learned to fake it and just smile along
Down on the street those men are all the same
I needa love, not games, not games
Candy I can't let you go
All my life you're haunting me
I loved you so
