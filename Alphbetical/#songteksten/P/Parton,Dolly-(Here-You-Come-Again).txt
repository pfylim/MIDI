Title  : HERE YOU COME AGAIN

(Words & music: Barry Mann/Cynthia Weil)

Here you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Pretty soon I'm wond'ring how I came to doubt you

All you gotta do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses

Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has right to
And shakin' me up, so that all I really know is

Here you come again
And here I go
