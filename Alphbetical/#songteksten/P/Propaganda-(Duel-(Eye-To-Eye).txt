PROPAGANDA - DUEL (EYE TO EYE)

Eye to eye stand winners and losers
Hurt by envy cut by greed
Face to face with their own disillusions
The scars of old romances still on their sheet

And when the blow be slow
The passion dies
Sweet little deaths
Just have been lies
Some memories of gone by times
Will still recall the lines

Refrain:
The first cut won't cut at all
The second only makes you wonder
The third will have you on your knees
You start bleeding
I start screaming
It's too late
The decision is made by fate
Time to prove what forever should last

Whose feelings are so true
And to stand the test
Whose demands are so strong
As to parry all attacks

And when blow by blow
The passion dies
Sweet little deaths
Just have been lies
Some memories of gone by times
Will still recall the lines
