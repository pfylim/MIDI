Title  : BABY IT'S YOU

(Words & music: L. & B. Knauer)

You're here with me now
But you're saying
You don't want me anymore
You're holding me now
But you're saying
You can't see me no more
You whisper goodbye
Then cling tighter to me
I can't take no more

Baby, it's you
Who makes me feel the way that you do
You know I can't forget you so soon
Baby, it's you

Running your fingers through my hair
But saying you care no more
You're kissing my ear
With a heart chilling breath
But you can't no more
Laying beside me with your legs around me
I care no more, oh no

Baby, it's you
Who makes me do the things that I do
You know I can't cast aside you so soon
Baby, it's you

Changing the show
Adding dramatics to help love grow
Your heart is your life
Cut it carefully with your knife
Don't leave the world, stay right here
Don't make, don't make anything rough

Baby it's you
Who makes me feel the way that you do
You know that I can't forget you so soon
Baby it's you
Baby it's you
Who makes me do the things that I do
You know I can't cast aside you so soon
Baby, it's you
