PET SHOP BOYS - HEART

(Words & music: ...)

Every time I see you
Something happens to me
Like a chain reaction
Between you and me
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time

If I didn't love you
I would look around for someone else
But every time I see you
You have the same effect
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time

Every time I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you
I mean what I say
I'm in love with you
And you don't know what it means to be with you
Beat beat beat heartbeat
Beat beat beat heartbeat

Every time I see you
No matter what we do
There's sa strange reaction
Can you feel it too
My heart starts missing a beat
My heart starts missing a beat
Every time
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time I hear your heart beat next to me
I'm in love with you
I mean what I say
I'm in love with you
And you don't know what it means to be with you
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time
Oh oh oh every time

Beat every time
Beat every time

Beat heartbeat
Beat heartbeat
Beat heartbeat

Heartbeat
