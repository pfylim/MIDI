Title  : SMILE

(Words & music: Werner Theunissen)

There were days I couldn't weep
Nights I couldn't sleep
And everything I did just turned out wrong
Till there was you to dry my tears
Whisper love words in my ears
And this is why I'm glad you came along

Now there's a smile
To cheer me up when I'm lonely
That I can call whenever I'm feeling down
Smile and yo know that I'm only
Longing for the minute you'll be around
Help me 'cause I'm trying to get over
The way I thought of love so many times before
If ever you should go away
And nobody else would be near
There's always a smile to remember 
That you were here

If I could fly I'd fly away
To a bright blue summerday
Trying to share my love
With you forever more
Darling yo made my life complete
You're everything  need
I'll never be the same I was before

Now there's a smile
To cheer me up when I'm lonely
That I can call whenever I'm feeling down
Smile and yo know that I'm only
Longing for the minute you'll be around
Help me 'cause I'm trying to get over
The way I thought of love so many times before
If ever you should go away
And nobody else would be near
There's always a smile to remember 
That you were here
