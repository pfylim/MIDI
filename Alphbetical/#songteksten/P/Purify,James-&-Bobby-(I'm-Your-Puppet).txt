Title  : I'M YOUR PUPPET

(Words & music: Dan Penn/Lidon Oldham)

Pull a string and I'll wink at you
I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to
I'm your puppet
I'm yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control
Of your puppet

Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips
I'm your puppet
Snap your fingers and I'll turn you some flips
I'm your puppet
Please be good
And I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet and you hold my strings
I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet

I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'd be warm or cold, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you, I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet

Just pull another string
And I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right, or make me do wrong
I'm your puppet

Your every wish is my command
All you've got to do is wiggle your little hand
I'm your puppet
I'm your puppet
I'm your walking, talking, living, loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string
I'll do anything
Yeah, I'll hug you, I'll kiss you
I'll be your loving puppet
I'm hanging on a string
I'll do anything
I'm your puppet
