Title  : THEN THE MUSIC STOPPED
Artist : PUSSYCAT

(Words & music: Pussycat)

When the music stopped
All the lights went out
Someone's crying out
Time to go
For a moment we
Wished reality
Wasn't there to be hurting so

Chorus:
A falling star
Music and candlelight
You know where they are
So darling, lead me through the night
When the music stopped
We just walked away
Into everyday
Where peoople go
Cloudy summernight
Dying city light
Now I know that I need you so
Please stay by me
'Cause I can still feel the falling rain
I wanna be loved by you
And the music starts again

Come along with me
I wanna be loved by you
And the music starts again
I wanna be loved by you
And the music starts again
