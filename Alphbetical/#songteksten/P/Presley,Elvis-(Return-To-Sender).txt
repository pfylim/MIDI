I gave a letter to the postman;
he put it in his sack.
Bright and early next morning, 
he brought my letter back.

She wrote up on it:
Return to sender, address unknown, 
no such number, no such zone.
We had a quarrel, a lover's spat, 
I write I'm sorry but my letter keeps coming back.

So then I dropped it in the mailbox and sent it Special D.
Bright and early next morning,
it came right back to me.
She wrote up on it:
Return to sender, address unknown, 
no such number, no such zone.

This time I'm gonna take it myself and put it right in her hand.
And if it comes back the very next day,
Then I'll understand the writing on it.
Return to sender, address unknown, 
no such number, no such zone.
Return to sender, address unknown, 
no such number, no such zone.
