PET SHOP BOYS - WEST END GIRLS

Sometimes you're better off dead
There's a gun in your hand
And it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad
Too unstable
Kicking in chairs
And knocking down tables
In a restaurant
In a west end town
Call the police there's a madman around
Running down
Underground in a dive bar
In a west end town

REFRAIN:
In a west end town
A dead end world
The east end boys
and west end girls

Too many shadows
Whispering voices
Faces on posters
Too many choices
If, when, why, what
How much have you got
Have you got it
Do you get it
If so how often
Which do you choose
A hard or soft option (how much do you need)

REFRAIN: ...

You got a heart of glass
Or a heart of stone
Just you wait till I get you home
You've got no future
You've got no past
Here today
Built to last
In every city
In every station
From la Geneva
To the Finland station (how far have you been)

REFRAIN: ...

West end girls, west end girls
East end boys, east end boys (how far have you been)
