Title  : REUNITED

(Words & music: Dino Fekaris/Freddie Perren)

I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The break-up we had has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I want you back
Hey, hey

I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such a way of learning so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I need your touch
Hey, hey

Chorus:
Reunited, and it feels so good
Reunited, 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
And, sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited, 'cause we're reunited
Hey, hey

I sat here staring at the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call
I wished I could climb right through the telephone line
And give you what you want, so you would still be mine
Hey, hey

I can't go cheatin', honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce of precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together 'cause I missed your kiss
Hey, hey

Chorus: ...

Ooh, lover, lover this is sudden love

And love exactly that I'm dreaming of

All through the day 

And all through the night

I'll give you all the love I have with all my might
Hey, hey

Chorus: ...
