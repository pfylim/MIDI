PRINCE - PURPLE RAIN

I never meant to cause you any sorrow
I never meant to you any pain
I only wanted one time to see you laughing
I only want to see you laughing in the purple rain

Refrain:
Purple rain purple rain
Purple rain purple rain
Purple rain purple rain

Only want to see you bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted to be your weekend lover
I only wanted to be some kind of friend, hey
Baby I could never steal you from another
It's such a shame our friendship had to end

Refrain: ...

Only want to see you underneath the purple rain

Honey I know I know I know times are changing
It's time we all reach out for something new
That means you too
You say you want a leader
But you can't seem to make up your mind
I think you better close it
And let me guide you to the purple rain

Purple rain purple rain
Purple rain purple rain
You know what I'm thinking about up here
Come on raise your hand
Purple rain purple rain

I only want to see you only want to see you
Purple rain



QUEEN - I WANT TO BREAK FREE

I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free
