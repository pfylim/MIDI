Title  : SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING

(Words & music: Dino Fekaris/Freddie Perren)

There's nothing more that I'd like to do
Than take the floor and dance with you
Keep dancin', let's keep dancin'

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

Chorus:
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show 'em how we do it now
Shake your groove thing
Shake your groove thing, yeah, yeah
Show 'em how we do it now
Show 'em how we do it now

Let's show the world we can dance
Bad enough ta strut our stuff
The music gives us a chance
We do more out on the floor
Groovin' loose or heart to heart
We put motion ev'ry single part
Funky sounds wall to wall
We're bumpin' booties havin' us a ball y'all

Chorus: ...

We've got the rhythm tonight
All the best know we're the best
Our shadows flash in the light
Twistin' turnin', we keep burnin'
Shake it high or shake it low
We take our bodies where they want to go
Feel that beat, never stop
Oh, hold me tight, spin me like a top

Chorus: ...

Groovin' loose or heart to heart
We put motion ev'ry single part
Funky sounds wall to wall
We're bumpin' booties havin' us a ball y'all

Chorus: ...
