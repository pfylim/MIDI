Memory Melody
Fly away
Tell the world we're free.

Tell the world
Our hopes and dreams
Time has come for the truth it 'seems
Let music make them understand,
Memory Melody.

Memory Melody
Fly away
Tell the world we're free.

Tell the world
About your way
How we lived and how we do today
Though we're far from the rainbows and
Memory Melody.

Memory Melody
Fly away.
Tell the world we're free.
Memory Melody,...
