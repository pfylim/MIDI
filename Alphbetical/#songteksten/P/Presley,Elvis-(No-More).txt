No more do I see the starlight caress your hair
No more feel the tender kisses we used to share
I close my eyes and clearly my heart remembers
A thousands goodbyes could never put out the embers.

Darling, I love you so and my heart forever
Will belong to the memory of the love
That we knew before, please come back to my arms
We belong together, come to me
Let's be sweet-hearts again
And then let us part no more

No more do i feel the touch of your hand on mine
No more see the lovelight making your dark eyes shine.
Oh, how I wish I never had caused you soorrow.
But don't ever say, for us there is no tomorrow.

Darling, I love you so and my heart forever,...
