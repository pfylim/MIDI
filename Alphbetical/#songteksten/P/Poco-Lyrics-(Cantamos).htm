<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

You and I counting, desert stars and,
Lovers, one by one.
While mandolins and steel guitars,
Help our love along.
Who could show you, ever know you,
Fall into my dream.
Turn around and, them you are in
cowboy boots and faded jeans.

It's a sagebrush serenade
II's a sagebrush serenade
It's a Sagebrush serenade

All around us, it surrounds us, harmony is
In the air.
We could lose our hearts tonight and
Never even care.

It's a sagebrush serenade, sagebrush . . . .
We dance the nighl away, while
the guitars play
We'll blow your sails away, we got it made

Susannah there was peace between
our fathers
How we ceased lo be a bother
We would run together in the morning light
And separate until the cool of night
oh my Susannah

We can throw our dreams together
Though my other wing of feather
How can you stop the lightening,
In the sky and as the rains run red
One of the reasons why, oh my Susannah

It ain't safe to stay here any more
Got to load the wagon and head up north.
And rearrange their reasons in our minds
Keeping safe a way in the present times.
Keeping safe a way in the present times.

Susannah there was peace between
Our fathers
How we ceased to be a bother
We could run together in the morning light
And separate until the cool of night
Oh my Susannah, for me there ain't no other
I swear, I swear there ain't no other.
That won't stop the lightening in the sky
And as the rains run red,
One of the reasons why . . Oh yeah you're
the light in the southern Sky, Susannah

Oh yeah, Tell tie, me a story 'bout how
You been burned.
No one can hurt you, your lessons
You've learned.
All for the lover vith the stars in his eyes
Feelin' the pain of all his bye byes.
Feelin' the pain of all his bye byes.
High and Dry, High and Dry.
I could tell you things just ain't the same
Look all around you there's no one to blame.
There is o reason for all of the tears.
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears
You do less cryin', there'll be fewer tears
High and Dry, High and Dry.

You know the road doesn't end.
When it reaches, reaches the bend
High and Dry, High and Dry.

I could tell you things just ain't the same.
Look all around you there's no one to blame
There is a reason for all of those tears.
You do less crying, there'll be fewer tears.
You do less crying, there'll be fewer tears.
High and Dry, High and Dry
High ond Dry, High and Dry.

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

There he goes he's a trader, moving
On through the virgin land.
Got the word from the government that it's
Too late for a lowly man, to make a Stand.
His reasons read like a prophecy.
He made them up as he went along
Those who saw it as a falacy are
Remembered as only dead and gone.
And now we all know who was right.
And the time showed who was wrong.
We saw them wield all their might.
I guess they knew that it wouldn't be long.
I guess they knew that it wouldn't be long.
He's come to change all the wilderness
Change the course of the rivers too.
He's not about ta stop for any rest
But somebody, please say we're through
Here we go again and again
Save your woman, save the land
Save the children, they are the future hands
In the promised land
They're the future hands in the promised land
They're the future hands in the promised land.

And now they're left without a home
Somebody left them in the cold

Though its true I'm living with
A travelling heart,
And it was yours you knew from the very start
And I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding
Lost in the time that slowly cries,
Come on riding
And 8 to 5 living, it ain't a lot less than alive
Knowing there's a dream calling out of
Your window
And don't we really know when time
is moving slow
And we all go on to nowhere

And every hour to work you say , just wishing
Where have I gone today . well I've
Gone fishing
With the sun in my eyes ond burning up
The skies and the river just watches me run.

Well its true I'm living with a
travelling heart,
But it was yours you knew from the very start
And I have come to know your eyes
When they're hiding
Lost in the time that slowly cries,
"Come on riding" yeah yeah

And all the stories you can read in the city
Look real hard between the lines, do you
See me?
Well the heart in my hand is slowing me
Down again
And the river just a watches me run.
Well the heart in my hands seems to slow
Me down again
And the river just watches me run. Aha.

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Well I came out Of nowhere just to see you
Now I can't find my way home feeling so blue
I See the sign by the corner light telling
Me which way to go, but I don't know.
When you walked up to me and told
me dearly.
How you'd like me to join, you said
quite clearly
Did it ever occur to you, that I might like to
See you?
Everyday I see a different situation,
I can't find much that is true
And you know it ain't much of a relation.
Still, I'm calling on you

All the lime I keep feeling how it could be,
Between lovers who only want to be free
Just the Same I don't feel too strong.
Armed with nothing but a song for too long.
Maybe there will be a day I see direction

. . . . -Oh Bitter Blue
Ooh Bitter Blue
I keep On calling out your name
I look outside and find the rain
If I only had an idea what to do-
About you Bitter Blue
Ooh Bitter Blue

Repeat

Did you hear that telephone ring?
You'd better get ready and pack your things
It's time to be going out again
Kiss the ladies goodbye, wipe the tears
From their pretty eyes.
You'll be back sometime, but you don't
Know when
Moving on and on through the country
Moving on and on in the towns
Things are getting better in the towns for
You and me.
I wanna make it last another time around.

About an hour down the rood
Remember how good it was to go
Chalk it up to the best of all times
And all those hours on the plane,
A million miles on your brain.
No cause to wonder if it's still a good time
Moving on and on through the country
Moving on and on in the towns,
Things ore getting better in the towns for
You and me.
I wanna make it last another time around.

You hear the telephone ring
You'd better get ready and pack your things
Oh it's time to be going out again.
Kiss the ladies goodbye, wipe the tears
From their pretty eyes
You'll be back sometime but you don't
know when
Moving on and on through the country
Moving on and on in the towns
Things are getting better in the towns for
You and me
I wanna make it last another time around
I wanna make it last another time around

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

You said you'd walk up to me any day
You'd come a laughing all the while.
You'd sit by me and we'd talk about today.
whatever happened to your smile?

Keeping your word you've come to me like
A stray.
Now I've been witness to a trial
And I feel as though it was only yesterday
Whatever happened to your smile?

Whatever happened to your smile?
The look upon your face,
The sparkle in your eyes?
The way you'd laugh, but for a while.
Whatever happened to your smile?
Whatever happened to your smile?

I do believe that you will not allow
Yourself to feel like a child
And i know it's hard to live for the
Here and now
But, whatever happened to your smile?

Now that you've come I guess you'll be
On your way
And you'll be travellin' many a mile.
But when you're back i hope that I won't
Have to say
Whatever happened to your smile?

Whatever happened to your smile?
The look upon your face,
The sparkle in your eyes?
The way you'd laugh, but for a while.
Whatever happened to your smile?
Whatever happened to your smile?

<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

All the ways of your love
The hurt and tears to cry
I sit and count the reasons why I ever
Fall in love.
It seems so simple to me.
I know just how it should be
You take my lovin', so carelessly
I keep on hoping someday you'll understand
A heart that is breaking and keeps waiting
For you

And, All the ways of your love
The hurt and tears to cry
I sit and count the reasons why I ever fall
In love
When we're together you treat me like a child
You only tell me, what you think you should.
What if tomorrow I was blown out of your life?
How would you find your way, with no one
To show you

All the ways of your love
The hurt and tears to cry
I sit and count the reasons why I ever
Fall in love
All the time that's passed us by
Could it be that I could find
Hearts that act so blind
And never even try
All the ways
