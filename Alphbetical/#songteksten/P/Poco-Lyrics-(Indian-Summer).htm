There's a full moon in the sky
It's got a hold on me, I'm hyptotized
Like your love it's getting stronger
Please keep my heart a little longer

Indian Summer is on it's way
Cool at night - and hot all day
Ain't no black clouds filled with rain
Santa Ana wind blew them all to Maine

Baby takes my hand
She says she understands
About the way I feel
She knows this love is real

I'm a wide open space cowboy
I got lazy ways I got some hidden joy
Motorcycle and tons of RPM
Ain't gonna wait around till it's here again

Baby takes my hand...

Indian Summer is on it's way

Well I've thought about the things I need
And I'm willing just to let them be
There is nothing that I'd want anyway
That could take the place of you
And all the things you do and say

We've come so very far in such a little time
And looking back there is only you that I find
Who was willing to give and maybe lose
You've got me tying up my walking shoes
These walking shoes

Twenty years on the run
I've only known a setting sun
Burning out on a lonely road
I've come to feel a lighter load

And now it's time we can turn the page
I believe you and I have come of age
All along it was there to see
What was really meant to be

It's a game the only one in town
It's a game all the changes going round
It's taken twenty years to get it on the way
And all I had to do was play

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

You're a woman  - you're a child
Sometimes you're weak and then you're wild
And I just can't understand
'Cuz I'm a boy who plays the part of a man, now
It's not hard to see
Must be the way it was meant to be

You keep me guessin' all the time
You play the fool and then you shine
Can I meet you in between?
'Cuz you know we could both do without a scene, now
I don't mean to blame you
I got some work of my own to do

Ooh - We could tear it down and build it up again
I'm talkin' 'bout you and me, first of all, learnin'
And maybe then we can make amends
We could follow it through to the very end - it's true
I'm talkin' 'bout me and you
Me and you

We could tear it down and build it up again...

<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

Thought I'd seen it all before
No one could show me any more
Sunny skies and and lights so bright
Winter winds deep in the night

Then came a woman
Heaven must have sent
And like a fool
I never guessed it meant

My downfall, Down, Downfall
I never thought I'd fall at all
Downfall, Downfall

If anyone should ask you why
I keep starin' at the sky
Tell them how it used to be
Tell them how it was with me

Then came a woman
Heaven must have sent
And like a fool
I never guessed it meant

My downfall
Down, Downfall
I never thought I'd fall at all
Downfall, Downfall

Then came a woman...

My downfall...

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

I've seen you falling behind your dreams
And pictures changing without the scenes
Broken stories and borrowed lines
Ain't it hard these days
To get on your way
Well, it's still what you do
And it's not so much in what you say

And there are people who ride a train
Into the city and back again
Only to get up in the same old frame
Could you reckon with them blues
In a world that's win or lose
Any fool could see
It goes on just the same

So many people inside the past
Talkin' 'bout these days they're movin' too fast
And the future it will not last
Everybody has a dream
Take the one you can live between
'Cause you're the only one that's left to choose
What you want to win or lose

Everybody has a dream

<A NAME="6"><H2>LIVING IN THE BAND</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

In the beginning
Not so long ago
There were five country rockers
I saw the very first show
And I jumped up with the crowd
To give a standing hand
Livin', livin' in the band

There were two from Colorado
Texas and Nebraska too
Another came from Ohio
And they did not sing the blues
You had the feeling
They had nothing to lose
Livin', livin' in the band

Through the years and the changes
And with the will of a train
Some have parted strangers
Some have stayed in the game
And sooner or later you've got a winning hand
Livin', livin' in the band

Through the years and the changes...

<PRE>
(Tomothy B. Schmit/Noreen Schmit)

Here I sit in my room
Nobody here but me and a simple tune
Hope you roll on in with the risin' moon
I wanna stay with you all night
Wanna stay with you night until noon - yes I do

Sayin' nothin', but feelin' strong
I'm a pretend poet with half a song
Hope you keep your word, wanna see you soon
I wanna stay with you all night
Wanna stay with you night until noon

Baby can you stay - stay until the break of day
I wanna feel your body sway
We can let them say what they want to
They can talk themselves into shades of blue
Baby I got lots of room
Wanna stay with you night until noon

We can let them say what they want to
They can talk themselves into shades of blue
Baby I got lots of room
Wanna stay with you night until noon

And my sometime friends say "Son' you better come around -
Get your feet back on the ground,
She's tryin' to fool ya...She only wants to do ya..."
Why are they so bent on bringing me down?

Here I'll sit and here I'll stay
And I'll be right here till you come my way
Someting's in the air - just about to bloom
I wanna stay with you all night
Wanna stay with you night until noon

Baby can you stay - stay until the break of day...

Stay...

<A NAME="8"><H2>FIND OUT IN TIME</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit/Robbin Thompson)

Ain't it funny how a good day flies - when you're high
Makes you feel you're so together - you don't know why
It's such a difference from days gone by
And you wish it could go on forever

All I really wanna see is you - in the night
Give me somethin' to believe in - so hang on tight
Drive the devil right from my sight
And you wish it could go on forever
But I know I'm really not that clever

I could follow you here, I could follow you there
But what good would it do in the meantime?
If I said that I loved you would it really be fair?
If I didn't would it be a crime?

Guess we'll find out in time
Patience is the key while we're waiting in line
Find out in time - you can bet your last dime
We're gonna find out what we need in time

I could follow you here, I could follow you there...

Guess we'll find out in time...

Guess we'll find out in time...

<A NAME="9"><H2>THE DANCE</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

WHEN THE DANCE IS OVER
Spinnin' around and around in a circle,
Once you sit down you start it all over again,
Laughin' so hard you lose all track of time,
So shuffle your feet and follow the beat on down

And when the dance is over
Who will your partner be
Will both of you be takin'
The chance to dance again?
The chance to dance again...

Everyone's slippin' away to the rhythm,
Lookin' to find someone to show them the light
So stare at the floor and pretend
You don't notice it's getting later and later tonight

GO ON AND DANCE
Can you hear the sound of music playing?
Can you hear the sound of voices saying?

The night is young and there's
No need to hurry
So take your time , you don't
Have to worry
Go on and dance
Go on and dance...
Dance now darlin', you'll find romance
Waitin' just for you
There is moonlight if you care to
Stop and see it through
Go on and dance
Go on and dance...
Can you hear the sound of guitars playing?
Can you hear the sound of children saying?

The night is young...

Dance now darlin'...

NEVER GONNA STOP
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop dance, dance, dancin'
Never gonna stop
Ain't never gonna stop dance, dance, dancin'

Never gonna stop...

Never gonna stop...

(REPRISE)WHEN THE DANCE IS OVER
And when the dance is over
Who will your partner be?
Will both of you be takin'
The chance to dance again?
The chance to dance...

And when the dance is over...
