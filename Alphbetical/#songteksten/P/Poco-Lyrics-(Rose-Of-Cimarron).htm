Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Shadows touch the sand and look to see who's standin'
Waitin' at your window, watchin' will they ever show?
Can you hear them calling? You know they have fallen on
Campfires cold and dark that never see a spark burn bright

Roll along, roll on
Rose of Cimarron
Dusty days are gone
Rose of Cimarron

Trails that brought them home echo names the've known
Four days high and lonely comin' to you only
You're the one they'd turn to, the only one they knew who'd do
All her best to be around when the ship were down

Hearts like yours belong
Following the dawn
Wrapped up in a song
Rose of Cimarron

Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I

Lookin' at you and the way about you
Fallin' come easily
No one could ever guess we'd stand here
Lookin' to disagree

Where did it all go wrong?
It seems we had too many stars in our eyes
Now we are lookin' back to see
How many stars were lies

Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I
Helplessly
Hangin' on
So darlin'
Stealaway

How did it get so damn confusin'?
Who cares who's wrong or right?
We gotta move out of all this darkness
To see a little light

Stealaway
My little darling
Far away
You and I
Helplessly
Hangin' on
So darlin'
Stealaway

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Everybody says you look like a dove
I agree
I think I know what they're thinkin' of
But every time they tell me you don't know how to love
Don't you know
I know that you're just tickin' it off
Just like me

And every time you call you have given it up
You refuse
To let yourself drink from the cup
It's easy to see for you times have been tough
But don't you know
I know that you're just callin' your own bluff

Don't you ever look around?
You're not the only one who's lost but could be found
Just like me

Late at night you're thinkin' you're crazy
But you really know better
Just like me

People try to tell you that you're heavy
But you're light as a feather
Just like me

I came home on Monday you were hangin' around
Not alone
Of which I didn't know then I found
That if I choose to see with my eyes to the ground
Well don't you know
I might as well be tied up and then bound

You were handed such a prize
I can onmly hope that you came outr more the wise
Just like me

Late at night you're thinkin' you're crazxy
But you're light as a feather
Just like me

People try to tell you that you're heavy
But you're light as a feather
Just like me

Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Don't you know
Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Here we go

'Long about Saturday night
We'll be here all right
So come on over, here's our chance
To sit it down and strum along
And everybody comes to call
It don't matter at all
If they don't know how to pick a tune
A-rollin' with the girls all night

Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Don't you know
Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Here we go

Look who's got a rockin' chair
I'll bet you five dollars he's there
Fallin' asleep to any beat
He don't seem to even care
Folks come from miles around
Jumpin' up and jumpin' down
Carryin' of carrtin' on
Till the break of dawn

Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Don't you know
Company's comin'
Come a-runnin'
Company's comin'
Here we go

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

As the moon goes fading
He lies awake waiting
For a break in the night
When he makes he's lonely flight
And it's the same old story
Somebody bound for glory
And somewhere in my life
I swear it had to belong

I've been countin' the stars
As they come on through the bars
And I've been heard singin'
A sad man's song
It's time for busting
Out of this jail
And get me a gun
No time for bail
And I've been here too many nights too long

And now I wonder if
They'll find me tonight
I've been sleepin' in the day
Runnin' below the pale moonlight

Hidin' in a canebrake
From a man I can't seem to shake
And in my head
I'm hearing a southern song
Mississippi,
Roll on in my brain
And keep me sheltered
In the summer rain
I could never stay here too many nights too long

And now I wonder if
They'll find me tonight
I've been sleepin' in the day
Runnin' below the pale moonlight

Escondido en un canaveral
De un hombre que no puedo ver
Y el hombre, escondido
De donde sera
Mississippi,
Roll on in my brain
And keep me sheltered
In the summer rain
I could never stay here too many nights too long
I could never stay here too many nights too long

(Paul Cotton)

I've got my head up on the ceiling
And I can't see myself lookin' down
At a heartthat has no feelin'
And I could not care when you come around

I'm tryin' to find a way to tell you,
Oh, my woman, you got to leave
And leave my life and try to make do
To somebody who will believe

If they could see through you to all of your lies
And take some time and maybe realize
That it's over before it began
And you're leavin' to find another man, oh.

I've got my head up on the ceiling
And I can't see myself lookin' down
At a heartthat has no feelin'
And I could not care when you come around

And I could not care when you come around.

<A NAME="8"><H2>STARIN' AT THE SKY</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

I can remember when I used to see you passin' by
And it seemed in vain when it never changed
'Cause the only thing we said was 'Hi'
Then out of nowhere
We got together
'Cause we didn't try
But then just as fast as it came to pass
I was alone again starin' at the sky

I've come to discover you've got to think it out on your own
and it takes some time for the words to rhyme
To really feel what you've always knows
And when you break through
You might even feel
As though you can fly
But when it all comes down I hope I'm around
And not alone again starin' at the sky

Wonderin' why
I can't let go cause I,
I think you really know your mind
If you could show me a sign
And keep me from goin' blind.

(Paul Cotton)

If you see me fallin'
By the wayside callin'
Pick me up and let me start again
This old road has a way
Of takin' me down a little each day
And I can't see my way around the bend

All the things I like to take
Cost so much more than I make
And it's hard keepin' even either way
And so I'm headed for the bar
Or another round of cards
And like the game we play it as they lay

And we're all alone together
On a road that seems forever
To be takin' you from yours and me from mine
And though we know just where we're goin'
There are changes that ain't showin'
Night and day become the same fine line

Night and day become the same fine line

My woman dances like a southern leel
She's out to take a chance to show me how it feels
But I can't sit here in this chair anymore
She's about to take my hand and drag me on the floor
