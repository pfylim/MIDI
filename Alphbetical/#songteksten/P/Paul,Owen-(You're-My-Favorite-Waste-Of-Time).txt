OWEN PAUL - YOU'RE MY FAVORITE WASTE OF TIME

You're mine
You're my favorite waste of time
Mine
Baby, you're my favorite waste of time

Here I am I'm play daydreaming fool again
My favorite game
And you are the one
Who's got my head in the clouds again
You're the one that I love

Refrain:
'Cause you're mine
Baby, you're my favorite waste of time
Mine
Baby, you're my favorite waste of time

I don't care if being with you is meaningless
and ridiculous
If it's wrong or right
I'm gonna give you my love tonight and
tomorrow night

Refrain: ...

'Cause you're mine
I must be out of my mind
Yes you're mine all the time
I'm wasting my time

Even though the love you give to me never shows
I can take the blows
And there's one last thing
I'm gonna give you my love tonight and
the bell's gonna ring

And you're mine
Baby you're my favorite waste of time
Mine
Baby you're my favorite waste of time
You're mine
You're my favorite waste of time
Mine
Baby you're my favorite waste of time
