Title  : JOLENE

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you
Please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him
Just because you can

Your beauty is beyond compare
With flaming locks of au-burn hair
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your voice is soft like summer rain
And I cannot compete with you Jolene

He talks about you in his sleep
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name Jolene

And as I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me Jolene

You could have your choice of men
But I could never love again
He's the only one for me Jolene

I had to have this talk with you
My happiness depends on you
And whatever you decide to do Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I'm begging of you
Please don't take my man

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Please don't take him 
Even though you can

Jolene, Jolene, please don't take my man Jolene
Jolene, my happiness depends on you Jolene
