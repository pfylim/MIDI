BLUE SUEDE SHOES - CARL PERKINS



Well it's one for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready 
Now go, cat, go but don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything, but lay off my blue suede shoes.

Well you can knock me down, step on my face
Slander my name all over the place,
Do anything that you want to do, but uh uh honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.

Well, you can burn my house, steal my car
Drink my cider from my old fruit jar.
Do anything that you want to do, but uh uh honey, lay off of my shoes
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes.
