Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby,
Be - bop - a - lu - la, I don't mean maybe.
Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby,
Be - bop - a - lu - la, I don't mean maybe.
Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby love,
my baby love, my baby love.

She's the girl in the red blue jeans,
she's the queen of all the teens.
She's the one that I know.
She's the one that loves me so.

Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby,
Be - bop - a - lu - la, I don't mean maybe.
Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby love,
my baby love, my baby love.

She's the one that's got that beat,
she's the one with the flyin' feet. 
She's the one that walks around the store.
She's the one that gets more and more.

Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby,
Be - bop - a - lu - la, I don't mean maybe.
Be - bop - a - lu - la, she's my  baby love,
my baby love, my baby love.
