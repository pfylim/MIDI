(Words & music: H. Belolo/V. Willis/J. Morali)

Young man, there's no need to feel down
I said young man, pick yourself of the ground
I said young man, 'cause you're new in town
There's no need to be unhappy
Young man, there's a place you can go
I said young man
When you're short of your dough
You can stay here
And I'm sure you will find many ways
To have a good time

Chorus:
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
They have everything for young men
To enjoy, you can hang out with all the boys
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
You can get yourself clean
You can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man, are you listening to me
I said young man, what do you want to be
I said young man, you can make real your dream
But you've got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said young man put your pride on the shelf
And just go there to the Y.M.C.A.
I'm sure they can help you today

Chorus: ...

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That's when someone came up to me and said
Young man, take a walk up the street
It's a place there, called the Y.M.C.A.
They can start you back on your way

Chorus: ...
