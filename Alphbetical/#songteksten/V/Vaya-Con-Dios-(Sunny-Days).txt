Title  : Sunny Days
Singer : Vaya Con Dios


What are you gonna do,
when the sunny days are over ?
Who will you be turning to,
when the sunny days are over ?
(Will you find somebody new ?)
Will your friends still buy the rounds
When the winds of fame have let you down ?
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)

What are you gonna do,
when the sunny days are over ?
Who will you be talking to,
when the sunny days are over ?
(Who will want to talk to you ?)
When the news is hitting town
Will the pretty girls still come around ?
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)

Will it take you long to remember me ?
Will it take me leaving to make you see
That it's over
(Sunny days are over)
Will it break your heart eternally ?
I'll be hurting for no one you see
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)

Will it take you long, too long for me
I'll be hurting for no one you see
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)

What are you gonna do,
when the sunny days are over ?
You might have to face the truth. 
when the sunny days are over
(You might have to face the truth)
When your feet have touched the ground
Will you find your journey's homeward bound ?
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)

Will it take you long to remember me ?
Will it take me leaving to make you see
That it's over
(Sunny days are over)
Will it break your heart eternally ?
'Cos I'll be hurting for no one you see
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)Will it take you long, too long for me
'Cos I'll be longing for no one you see
When it's over
(Sunny days are over)
