Title  : GREASE

(Words & music: Barry Gibb)

I solve my problems and I see the light
We got a lovin' thing
We gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growing pain
Why don't they understand it's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lying, only real is real
We stop the fight right now
We got to be what we feel

Chorus:
Grease is the word
It's got a groove
It's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

We take the pressure and we throw away
Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believing now that we can be who we are

Chorus: ...

This is a life of illusion, wrapped up in troubles
Laced in confusion
What are we doing here?
