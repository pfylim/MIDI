VOICES OF AMERICA - HANDS ACROSS AMERICA

This sky so serene
Has felt the kiss of countless dreams
And this earth that smells so sweet
Cradles us all in its great heartbeat

So we must learn to love each other
See that man over there he's my brother
And when he laughs I laugh
And when he cries I cry
And when he needs me I'll be right there by his side

Hands across America
Hands across this land I love
Divided we fall
United we stand
Hands across America

Mothers and fathers daughters and sons
We should be living together as one
And I can't help thinking again and again
The heart of a stranger beats the same as a friend

So we must learn to love each other
See those people over there they're my
Sister and brother
And when they laugh I laugh
And when they cry I cry
And when they need me I'll be right there
by their side

Hands across America
Hands across this land I love
Divided we fall
United we stand
Hands across America

We are the river of hope
That runs through the valley of fear
And there's a lady whose smile shines upon us
Saying all are welcome here

So we must learn to love each other
See that man over there he's my brother
And when he laughs I laugh
And when he cries I cry
And when he needs me I'll be right there by his side
