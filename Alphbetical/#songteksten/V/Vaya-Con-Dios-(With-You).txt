Title  : With You
Singer : Vaya Con Dios


Come bon baby, set my soul on fire
Love me like no one's ever done before
Drive me crazy, baby with desire
Get me where you want me and I'll ask for more

Chorus:
I'll walk through the desert with you
Through fire and water with you
I'd climb any mountain with you
The power of love is all I'll ever need

And right by your flame I wanna feel the heat

Chorus

You know our love is gonna get us higher
And I ain't ready baby to come down
Each time we touch I'm purring like a tiger
True hot lovers from dusk to dawn

Chorus
