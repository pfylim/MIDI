MILLI VANILLI - GIRL YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE

(Words & music: B.Pettaway/S.Spencer/K.Lyles/R.Hollaman/K.Adeyma)

Bo, what are you doing back?
Well I sat back
And thought about things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me, you mean a lot to me
I really mean that much to you?
Girl you know it's true

I'm in love with you girl
'Cause you're on my mind
You're the one
I think about most every time
When you crack a smile
And everything you do
Don't you understand girl
This love is true
Your soft silky hand
Long sweet and thin
That candle like a passion
Upon your skin
It lightens my day
And that's also true
Together we're one
Separated we're two
To make you all mine
All mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality
That I admire
To put it plain and simple you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love girl, I'm so in love girl
I'm just in love girl and this is true

Girl you know it's true
Oh ooh ooh I love you
Yes you know it's true
Ooh ooh ooh I love you
Girl you know it's true, my love is for you
Girl you know it's true, my love is for you
This is so in vain girl
I can't explain
My emotions starts up
When I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice
Which rings in my ears
It stimulates my senses girl
When you are near
And with your positive emotions
Love making enjoy
There's no need to bust

It's like girl and a boy
These feelings I get
I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this
Girl just you and I

Now what you wear I don't care
The reason that I like you
Girl, is what you are
It I sit
And think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love girl, I'm so in love girl
I'm just in love girl and this is true
