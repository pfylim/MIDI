Together we will go our way
together we will leave some day
together your hand in my hand
together we will make the plans
together we will fly so high
together tell our friends good bye
together we will start life new
together this is what we'll do.

Go west life is peaceful there
go west lots od open air
go west to begin life new
go west this is what we'll do
go west sun in wintertime
go west we will do just fine
go west where the skies are blue
go west this and more we'll do.

Together we will love the beach
together we will learn and teach
together change our pace of life
together we will work and strive
I love you, I know, you love me
I want you happy and carefree
so that's why I have no protest
when you say you want to go west.

Go west life is peaceful there,...

I know that there are many ways
to live there in the sun or shade
together we will find a place
to settle down and live with space
without the busy pace back east
the hustling, rustling of the feet
I know I'm ready to leave too
so this is what we're going to do.

Go west life is peaceful there,...
