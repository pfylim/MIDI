9. Y.M.C.A. - VILLAGE PEOPLE

Young man.
There`s no need to feel down.
I said. Young man.
Pick yourself off the ground.
I said. Young man.
Cause you`re in a new town.
There`s no need to be unhappy.

Young man.
There`s a place you can go.
I said. Young man.
When you`re short on your dough.
You can stay there.
And I`m sure you will find many 
Ways to have a good time.

Chorus
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
They have everything.
What you`re meant to enjoy.
You can hang out with all the boys.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
You can get yourself clean.
You can have a good meal.
You can do what ever you feel.

Young man are you listening to me.
I said. Young man.
What do you wanna be.
I said. Young man.
You can make all your dreams.
But you got to know this one thing.
No man does it all by himself.
I said. Young man.
Put your pride on the shelf.
And just go there to the YMCA.
I`m sure they can help you today.

Chorus

Young man.
I was once in your shoes.
I said. I was
Down and out with the blues.
I felt no man
Cared if I where alive.
I felt the whole world was so jive.
That`s when someone came up to me
And said. Young man.
Take a walk up the street.
There`s a place there.
Called the YMCA.
They can start you back on your way.

It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
They have everything.
What you`re meant to enjoy.
You can hang out with all the boys.
YMCA.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
Young man young man.
There`s no need to feel down.
Young man young man.
Pick yourself off the ground.

YMCA.
It`s fun to stay at the YMCA.
Young man young man.
Are you listening to me.
Young man  young man.
What you do wanna be.
YMCA.
You find it at the YMCA.
No man young man
Does it all by himself.
Young man young man
Put your pride on the shelf.
YMCA And just go to the
YMCA
Young man young man
I was once in your shoes.
