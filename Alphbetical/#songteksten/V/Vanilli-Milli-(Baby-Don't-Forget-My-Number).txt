MILLI VANILLI - BABY DON'T FORGET MY NUMBER

Baby don't be shy
When you're holding my hand
'Cause as time goes by
You got to understand
It's you (can I dance with you)

B-b-b-baby in your eyes I see, it's so clearly
That our love is so strong
And you'll never go wrong (and he)
I got the best for you

So when you're in doubt
And you're needin' someone
Baby call my line
Call me any time (and he)
I'll be there for you
I've been searching high (high high)
I've been searching low (low low)

Chorus:
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my number
(Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby)
Love is stronger than thunder
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Don't forget my number
Love will see you through

I've been searching high
I've been searching low
Wanna spend my life with you
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Can I dance with you
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Love will see you through

B-b-b-baby in your eyes I see it so clear
That our love is so strong
And you'll never go wrong (and he)
I got the best for you

So when you're in doubt
And you're needin' someone
Baby call my line
Call me any time (and he)
I'll be there for you
I've been searching high
I've been searching low
