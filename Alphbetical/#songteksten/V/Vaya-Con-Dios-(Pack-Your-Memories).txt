Title  : Pack Your Memories
Singer : Vaya Con Dios


Pack your memories and leave
Don't give it a second thought
All he's given you is grief
And pain you can do without
Pack your memories and leave, girl
You know love is just a game of chance
There's always someone, can't you see
Leading someone, a pretty dance

Chorus:
You can moan about your worries
You can howl at your regrets
Drink them all away
Stay out 'til the morning, get it going
But they will be there by the break of day

Pack your memories and leave
Don't try to look behind
The things he made you believe
Girl, you must have bee blind
Pack your memories and leave
And run as far as you can
Let the song in the breeze
Take you by the hand

Chorus
