Title  : JUST WHEN I NEEDED YOU MOST

(Words & music: Randy Vanwarmer)

Packed in the morning, I stared out the window
And I struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more than I missed you before
And now where I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me

Chorus:
Just when I needed you most
You left me just when I needed you most

Most ev'ry morning I stare out the window
And I think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cause I need you more that I needed before
And now you left me

Chorus: ...

I loved you more than I needed before
And now I'll find comfort, God knows
'Cause you left me

Chorus: ...

Packed in the morning, I stared out the window
And I struggle for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more than I missed you before

Chorus: ...
