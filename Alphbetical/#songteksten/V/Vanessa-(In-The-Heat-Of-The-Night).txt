Artist : VANESSA

Angelo
Don't hide the tears you show
Once you knew
I was the one for you
I'd give you everything
If you needed anything
In the heat of the night

Love is blue
If you don't know what to do
Do you say
There's no need for me to stay
Well, I gave you everything
When you needed anything
In the heat of the night

Chorus:
Help me, help me
I'm feeling so alone
I can't make it on my own
Touch me, need me
Like I am wanting you so bad
In the heat of the night

Years went by
I've learned how to hide my pride
So Angelo
If ever you should change your mind
'Cause I've missed you twice as much
Ooh, your magic touch
In the heat of the night

Help me, help me
Can't make it through the night
I got you on my mind
Touch me, need me
Like I am wanting you, so bad
In the heat of the night

Help me, help me
In the heat of the night
In the heat of the night
In the night
Touch me, need me
In the heat of the night
So bad, in the heat of the night

Chorus: ...

In the heat of the night
