Title  : RELEASE
Artist : PATTI LABELLE

(Words & music: Allen R. Toussaint)

Now is the time, time to release
Time to release your love (2x)
We've been in a stale-mate so long
Like being locked up in a prison
And I don't want to be that way with you

Chorus:
Release, release the tension
There's too much tension in the world
Release, show some emotion
And let the motion rock us away
Rock on, rock on, release

Now is the time, time to release
Tome to release your love (2x)
We've been in a stand-still so long
And it's ;not getting any better
Slowly, slowly, slowly drifting apart

Chorus: ...

And it's not getting any better
Slowly, slowly, slowly drifting away
