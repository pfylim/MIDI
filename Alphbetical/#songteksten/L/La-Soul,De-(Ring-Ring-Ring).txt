Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave
Ya name and ya number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave
Ya name and ya number
And I'll get back to you
DOVE
Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the day glo
Knockin' at the doe sayin' a yo yo
Knockin' at the doe sayin' a yo yo
I got a funky new tune
With a fly banjo
I can't understand
What the problem is
I find it hard enough
Dealin' with my own biz
How day get my name
And number down
Then I stop and think
And wonder bout
A plan ya man
I gotta step out town
Ya wanna call me up
Take my number down
It's 222-2222, I got
An answering machine
That could talk to you

REFRAIN:
   POS
   Exit the old style enters the new
   But nothing's new
   Bout being hawked my a few
   Or should I say a flock cuz
   Around every block there's
   Harry, Dick and Tom
   With a demo in his palm
   Now I'm with helping
   Those who want to help themselves
   And flaunt a nut
   That's dogie as a dough
   Put it's not the move
   To hear the tales of limosines and
   Pails of money
   They'll make like a pro
   I'd be like yo black
   Just play me the tape
   Would actally show the time
   To spare or just make
