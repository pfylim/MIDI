Singer : LITTLE RIVER BAND 
Title  : HOME ON MONDAY

(Words & music: Beeb Birtles/Glen Shorock)

Can you guess where I'm calling from
The Las Vegas Hilton
I know it's hard to hear
It's just the echo on the line
Yes that's right I'm calling you
From the Las Vegas Hilton
I just want you to say that I'm feeling fine

Chorus:
I'll be home on a monday
Somewhere around noon
Please don't be angry
I'll be back with you real soon

I was hoping to catch a glimpse
Of the man from Memphis
They told me that he had gone
Never leaving a trace
I just could never get involved
With those one armed bandit
Sure am craving for the smile on your face

Chorus: ...

You looked so lovely
When I left
I nearly didn't go
Twelve thousand miles is such a long way
Help me get to grips with Hollywood
You're getting through to me
Hollywood you're in my movie

Chorus: ...
