TONE LOC - WILD THING

Working all week, nine to five for my money
So when the weekend comes, I can go get live with the honey
Rolling down the street, I saw this girl and she was pumping
I winked my eye she got into the ride, went to a club
It was jumping
Introduced myself as LOC she said you're a liar
I said I got it going on baby doll And I'm on fire
Took her to the hotel, she said you're the king
So be my queen, if you know what I mean
And let's do the Wild Thing

refrain:
Wild Thing, she loved to do the Wild Thing
Wild Thing, Please baby baby please

Shopping at the mall, looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl, she cold rocked my world
And I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said
You got plans for the night
I said hopefully if things go well, I'll be with you tonight
So we journeyed to her house, one thing led to another
I saw a key in the door, cold hit the floor
Looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say, I was hanging by a string
She said hey you two, I was once like you
And I liked to do the Wild Thing

refrain: ...

Posse in effect, hanging out is always hyped
And with me and the crew, leaving a shindig
With a girl who's just my type
Saw this luscious little frame, I'm not lying fellows she was fine
This sweet young miss, cold gave me a kiss
And I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine, still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over
and gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock, she was like static cling
But that's what happens, when bodies start slapping
From doing the Wild Thing

refrain: ...

Doing a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick, was on my jock, so I said what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and to a little dance
So I said chill for now, but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished, I took her round the way
And what do you know, she was good to go, without a word to say
We was all alone and she said Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need fifty dollars to make you holler
I get paid to do the Wild Thing
Say what, you luv you must be kidding
Yo Walk you ready, let's break on outta here
Hasta la vista baby, Wild Thing
