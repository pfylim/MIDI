Singer : LONG TALL ERNIE & THE SHAKERS 
Title  : REMEMBER

(Words & music: A.J. Britnell/A. Treffers)

Think of all the stars from the fifty scene
Jukebox heroes and all the screams
Buddy Holly, and Peggy Sue
Ricky Nelson, got his Mary Lou
Do you remember
Do you remember

There were Don and Phil
When they sang Bird Dog
Buona Sera Senorita
Rock Around The Clock
Little Richard and Bobby Rydell
Elvis Presley, Heartbreak Hotel
Do you remember
Do you remember
Do you remember
