Title  : SHINE SILENTLY

(Words & music: Nils Lofgren/Dick Wagner)

Just another room
Just another town
Same old crazy people hanging around
Still you shine silently
Starin' into space
Coming down alone
Feel like packin' all my bags and runnin' home
Well you shine silently

Chorus:
Shine silently
I don't need no light in the darkness
Shine silently
Ooh no, I won't get lost
While your love shines, shines on me
Shines on me

People at the door
People on the phone
Same old story, no time of my own
Still you shine, silently

Nothing left to say
Nothing left to prove
When it's said and done there's
Nothin' left but you baby
Shining silently

Chorus: ...
