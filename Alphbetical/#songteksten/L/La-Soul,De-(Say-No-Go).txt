DELA SOUL - SAY NO GO

(Words & music: P.Huston/P.Mercer/D.Jolicoeur/V.Mason/S.Scipio
D.Hall/J.Oates/S.Allen)

Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could have talks that soon
In the delivery room
It would have asked the nurse for a hit

The reason for this
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me
Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new life

What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me
To understand the path
To be base head
Consumer should erased it
In the first wave
'Cause second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it
Then even talk to it
And say you got the body
Now you want my soul
Well I can't have none of that
Tell 'em what to say Mase

Say no go, say no go
Say no go, say no go

Naw no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this word
Word to the mother
I'll tell the truth
So bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like pleather
You don't want to wear it
No need to ask that question
Just don't mention
You know what the answer is
Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made
Held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade
Did he take any heed naaa
The boy was hooked
You could phrase the world base
And the kid just shook

In his fashion class once A
now F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes mad for Oshkosh
Has now converted to nothing but stonewashed

Now hopping in a barrel
Is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down son
'Cause that could mean down and out
As an action
What does it lead to
Dum dum dum dum
People say what have I done
For all my years
My tears show my hard earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
'Cause a pusher's a jerk

Say no go, say no go
Say no go, say no go

Believe it or not
The plot forms a fee
More than charity
But the cost doesn't coincide
With the ride of insanity
Is it a chant to slant the soul to fill for it
I know it's the border that flaunts the order
To kill for it

Standing
Scheming on a young one
Thinking this time
Eight ball for a cool player
Racked it all
Tried to break
Miscued got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I asked what's the fix
For the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should've been no

Run me a score from the funky hour
Plus one more (it's the joint)
Rewind the back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch the zombies scream it's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

Say no go, say no go
Say no go, say no go

Don't even think about it

Say no go
