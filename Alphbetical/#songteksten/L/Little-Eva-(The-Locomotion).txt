
       Do the Lokomotion              Little Eva


Everybody's doin'a brand new dance now
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
i know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance now
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
my little baby sister can do it with ease
it's easier the learnin'your a b c's
so come on come on do the locomotion with me

Refrain

You gotta swing your hips now
come on jump up jump back
oh well i think you got the knack


Oh now that you can do it let's make a chain now
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
chug-a-chug-a motion like a railroad train now
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
do it nice and easy now don't lose control
a little bit of rythm and a lot of soul
so come on come on do the locomotion with me

Synthisolo

Move around the floor in a locomotion
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
do it holdin' hands of you get the notion
(C'mon baby do the locomotion)
there's never been a dance that's so easy to do
it ever makes you happy when you're feelin blue
so come on come on do the locomotion with me
