ROK THE NATION

Text + Musik: 
Interpret   : Leila K.
--------------------------------------------------------

Coolin' around in a merry-go-round
East west north and south I spread the sound
Sophisticated like an African queen
The K. once again in the light
Nation wide I kick microphone
Knowledge mean like SM bondage
I'm hyped up like a 747
Leila K. all the way to MC heaven
You thought I was a onetimer
You thought I was a fake
Don't you know the L.E.I.L.A.
will never perpetrate
I gain fame EL Khalifi my last name
My occupation you listen to the game
But don't relax get your ass on the floor
The K. will score for sure
`Causen you want more. Let's raise the roof
Can you feel the vibration 'cause we are here to
Rok the nation
--------------------------------------------------------
Just for fun bang bang like a drum
Not on the run just rhyme and having fun
Just for fun bang bang like a drum
Want me to move you it's done
--------------------------------------------------------
Love is No.1, No.2 is a gun
'Cause you got to be safe when you're on the run
Back in time I couldn't show my face
I had a street name and crime brought me fame
Bounty Killers Michael Jackson Thrillers
A bad kind of girl in a spooky world
A young female serious attitude
Not on the run just rhyming and having fun
Queen of Revolution I got the solution
On the radion confusion not like the other
Rap sisters and brothers, bad mothers
What is right and what is wrong
Let me teach you a lesson on the microphone
Let's raise the roof
Can you feel the vibration 'cause we are here to
Rok the nation
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm doing, I'm moving prooving the funky
grooving as the lyrics get funkier
I see the people after me I don't really care
Flirt with their money, I say "call me later honey"
Hahaha that's kind of funny for a lady like me
cause I'm not like that you see
Let's raise the roof
Can you feel the vibration
'Cause we are here to
Rok the nation
