Title  : MY MAN

(Words & music: Janschen & Janschens)

He was workin' on the railroad
In a sturdy tough guy's world
And that night
He was the watchman
When a muffled sound he heard
He went in quest of
Where it came from
He saw two man
They had a fight
When he tried to separate them
A shot rang through the night

Refrain:
My man, only one shot took my man away
My man, life will never be the same
We were so much in love
My man, only one shot took my man away
My man, it will never be the same

He was working
For the future
'Cause we married very soon
People say now
He was a hero
They have his picture
In their room
A lot of money I get offered
From the railroad company
But how could I ever spend it
While I wanted a family

Refrain: ...2x...
