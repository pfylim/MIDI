HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS - STUCK WITH YOU

We've had some fun
Yes we had our ups and downs
Been down that rocky road
But here we are still around
We thought about some else
But neither one took the bait
We thought about breaking up
Now we know it's much too late
We are bound by all the rest
Like the same phone number
All the same friends and the same address

Refrain:
Yes it's true
I am happy to be stuck with you
Yes it's true
I am happy to be stuck with you
'Cause I can see
That you're happy to be stuck with me

We've had our doubts
We never took them seriously
And we've had our "ins" and "outs"
But that's the way it's supposed to be
We thought about giving up
But we could never stay away
Thought about breaking up
But now we know it's much too late
And it's no great mystery
If we change our minds
Eventually, it's back to you and me
