DE LA SOUL - ME MYSELF AND I

Mirror, mirror on the wall, tell me mirror what is wrong
Can it by my De La clothes or is it just my De La song
What I do ain't make believe people say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La it's just me myself (play it now)
and I

refrain:
Oh oh oh hey hey hey oh oh oh oh oh
It's just me myself and I
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It's just me myself and I
Oh oh oh oh hey hey hey hey
It's just me myself and I
Hey I oh oh oh oh hey oh oh oh oh oh oh

Now ya tease my Plug One style and my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies no we're not
That's pure plug bull always pushin' that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One it's just me myself (play it now)
and I

refrain: ...

Proud I'm proud of what I am poems I speak the Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be himself not what you
read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written on the soul De La that is
Style is surely our own thing not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul and this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie and from me myself and I

refrain: ...

Glory glory halleluh glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied by Kcids and gooky eyes
People think they diss my person by stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Qtip and he states (black is black)
Mirror, mirror on the wall, shovel chestnuts in my path
This keeps all nuts with the nuts so I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them in the fourth day of July
Cuz they tried to mess with third degree that's me myself and I

refrain: ...
