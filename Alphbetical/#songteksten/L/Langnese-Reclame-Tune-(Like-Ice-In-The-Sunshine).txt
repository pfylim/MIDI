               Like ice in the sunshine


Like ice in the sunshine like ice in the sunshine
I'm meltin away on a sunny day
like ice in the sunshine like ice in the sunshine
I'm meltin away on a sunny day

When you walk along the bridge see the boys and girls
hand in hand
relax in the midday heat with an icecream in your hand

Refrain

Like ice ...


If you wanna have some fun feeling groovy down
by the sea
lay down in the sumer sun feel the good
vibration with me
 
Refrain

Like ice ...


When you're at the ocean bay see the surfers
glide on a whrich
hang on on a sunny day with an icecream on the beach

Refrain

Like ice ...
