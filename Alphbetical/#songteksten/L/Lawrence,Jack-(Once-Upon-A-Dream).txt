I know you !
I walked with you
once upon a dream
I know you !
The glam in your eyes
is so familiar a gleam.
Yet, I know it's true
that visions are seldom
all they seem,
But If I know you,
I know what you'll do;
You'll love me at once
the way you did
once upon a dream.
And I know it's true
that visions are seldom
all they seem,
But If I know you,
I know what you'll do;
You'll love me at once
the way you did
once upon a dream.
