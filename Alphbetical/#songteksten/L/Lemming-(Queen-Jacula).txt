Title  : QUEEN JACULA

You're my queen of mystery
Yes, you're my queen of love
Every step that you will take
I'm watching from above

You rule the death, you take the breath
Of any human being
When nights are cool the vampires rule
And live their mystic scene

We adore you Jacula
At your service Jacula
We will follow Jacula

Take my hand and be my crutch
So I can be with you
Then I will kiss your pretty lips
And share my life with you

Then I get just what I want
So I can dethrone you
And all the evil and your hate
Will vanish just like you

We adore you Jacula
At your service Jacula
We will follow Jacula
