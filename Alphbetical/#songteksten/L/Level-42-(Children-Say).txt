LEVEL 42 - CHILDREN SAY

I keep to myself what I might share with others
But they don't seem to understand
I open my mouth to rediscover
That I don't have the words at my command
Holding out for a world so much better
But I'm a stranger in a stranger's land
All my friends have sold out
Couldn't handle the pressure
Counting their blessings trying to salvage
What they can

refrain:
Children say, children say
We open our minds as one
But one more day slips away
Why don't the dreams of the young 
Ever come to be

When I overhear my parents' conversations
Well I'm stuck by the things they say
It seems they traded the years for more complications
Whoever thought it could end this way
They closed the door but they can't lock it
'Cause something of their childhood remains
And they've felt it before when the man in their pocket
Counted the cost of their material gains

Children say come what may
Be strong for the friends you've known
But one fine day far away
Will we remember the love we used to own

refrain: ...

Everybody hear them say

Well you knew what I was saying
But did you know what it meant
When you saw that look in my eye
Did you know that it was heaven sent
Was it all a waking dream
All that time we must have spent
Well I guess it must have been
Somehow that feeling came and went

Children say come what may
Be strong for the friends you've know
But one fine day far away
Will we remember the love we used to own

refrain: ...

And our children say
Children say, children say
