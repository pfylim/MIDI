PATTY LaBELLE & MICHAEL McDONALD - ON MY OWN

Ooh so many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On my own, on my own, on my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own, once again now
One more time, by myself

No one said it was easy, no
But it once was so easy
Well I believed (I believed)
In love (In love)
Now here I stand
I wonder why, ooh

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way (on my own)
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
(on my own)
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you it cuts like a knife, hey
You walked out
And there went my life
I don't want to live without you
On my own (this wasn't how it was supposed to end)
On my own (I wish that we could do it all again)
(I never dreamed I'd spend)
On my own (one night alone)
By myself

(On my own) I've got to find where I belong again
(On my own) I've got to learn to be strong again
(On my own) I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
(By myself) By myself, by myself

Oh I've got to find out what was mine again
(On my own) My heart is saying that it's time again
(On my own) And I have faith that I will shine again
(By myself) I have faith in me
