Singer : AMANDA LEAR 
Title  : ENIGMA

(Words & music: R. Pietsch/A. Lear)

Give a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Give a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
And your eyes like a laser
Every time cut me deeper

Choir : Give a bit of mmh to me
Amanda: You're a mystery
Choir : And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Amanda: It's so confusing
Choir : Give a bit of mmh to me
Amanda: You're a mystery
Choir : And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Amanda: Or am I dreaming?
Are you devil or angel?
Are you question or answer?

For you I'll break all the rules
And for you I'll go to the moon
'Cause you're the one, there's no one else

For me you are an enigma
For me you are really a mystery
A mystery, a mystery

Spoken:
I just can't make you out
Are you real or am I dreaming?
This is all very confusing
Specially when you start singing

Give a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Give a bit of mmh to me
And I'll give a bit of mmh to you
Are you devil or angel?
Are you question or answer?
For me you are an enigma
For me you are really a mystery
A mystery, a mystery
For you I'll break all the rules
And for you I'll go to the moon
'Cause you're the one, there's no one else
For you I'll break all the rules
And for you I'll go to the moon
'Cause you're the one, there's no one else
