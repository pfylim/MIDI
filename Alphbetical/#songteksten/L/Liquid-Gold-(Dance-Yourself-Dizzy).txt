Title  : DANCE YOURSELF DIZZY

(Words & music: A. Baker/E. Seago)

Tonight they're turning on the beat
Tonight you're in for such a treat
Tonight put on your dancin' feet
And dance, dance, dance

Tonight we'll leave the world behind
Tonight from now the place and time is right
So put your hand in mine
And dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance yourself dizzy

Chorus:
Dance yourself dizzy when they boogaloo
L.A. to Manhattan is an open door for you
So dance yourself dizzy, this is dynamite
Baby, we should be dancin' back to back tonight

Tonight there's something in the air
Tonight to set this mad affair alright
I'm burning ev'rywhere, so dance, dance, dance
Tonight
Tonight, will be a boogie-oogie night
So dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance yourself dizzy

Chorus: ...
