Title  : HOUSE FOR SALE

The sign went up one rainy morning
Just a couple of hours of the door
Mrs Hadley peeked out through her curtains
Wondrin' what was going on
Neighbors said over coffeecups
That nice young couple is breaking up

In the living room the linen and the crystal
Sit all packed and set to go
I tell myself once more I won't be here
The spring to see my roses grow
All the things you tried to fix
The roof still leaks the door still sticks

House for sale
You can read it on the sign
House for sale
It was yours and it was mine
And tomorrow some strangers
Will be climbing up the stairs
To the bedroom filled with memories
The one we used to share

I know you always loved that painting
From that funny little shop in Spain
Remember how we found it
When we ducked in from that
Sudden summer rain
But I think I'll keep the silver tray
My mother gave us on our wedding day
