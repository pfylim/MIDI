Title  : SOMEONE IS WAITING FOR YOU

Someone is waiting for you
In a waiting room
Open the door and find
Maybe that someone is the one
That you've been looking for

And someone is hiding himself
Behind a masquerade
Open his eyes and find
Maybe that someone is the one
That you've been looking for
Somehow

You meet always somebodies
That you like
But most of those somebodies
Don't treat you right

Someone is waiting for you
In a waiting room
Open the door and find
Maybe that someone is the one
That you've been looking for

And someone is hiding himself
Behind a masquerade
Open his eyes and find
Maybe that someone is the one
That you've been looking for
Somehow
