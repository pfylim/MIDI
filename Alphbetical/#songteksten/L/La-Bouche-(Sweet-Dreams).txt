Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through th enight
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night
Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night
When your body is movin', the music's gooving
I wanna take you home tonight
Ola ola eh ola ola eh
Ola ola eh ola ola eh
Keep dancin hard give this groove more feeling
Dance trance, dance more dealing
In, out, up, down, all around
On the dance fllor getting down
Take the time, yes you sure improve
We can make your body move
Totally yes the party started
Sweet dreams keep coming harder
I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what i?m saying
Now everything will be alright
