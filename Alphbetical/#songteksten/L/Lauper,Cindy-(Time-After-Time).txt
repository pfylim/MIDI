Title  : Time After Time
Singer : Cyndi Lauper


Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick, 
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion
Is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories
Time after time

Sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Chorus:
If you're lost you can look
And you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you
I'll be waiting
Time after time

After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm O.K.
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time

Chorus

You said go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds

Chorus
Time after time (4x)
