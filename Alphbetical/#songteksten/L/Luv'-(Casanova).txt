Singer : LUV' 
Title  : CASANOVA

(Words & music: Janschen/Janschens)

In the summer of '75
He said you'll play a part in my life
In the autumn of '75
He sid would you, would you be my wife
In the winter of '76
He said, thanks for the wonderful time
I'm not the type of a family man
You go your way, so I go mine

La la la la la la la la

Chorus:
Ooh ooh, aah, aah, he's such a Casanova
If you meet the man
Do remember then
Keep away from the sofa
He's such a Casanova
In the dancing place
You will know the face
By the glance of his eyes
He'll come and ask you for some tango
He'll say you're dancing quite alright
Aah, aah, you're drinking too much vino
With him aah, you can stay the night
He's such a Casanova
In the dancin' place
You will know the face
By the glance of his eyes

Talent leather boots over tight pants
Open shirt and well manicured hands
Shiny chain round the wrist and the neck
Ooh that man is as sharp as a tack
If you want him, to me it's alright
Though you know that you're not bein' smart
There's only one thing I guarantee you
That one day soon he'll break your heart

Chorus: ...
