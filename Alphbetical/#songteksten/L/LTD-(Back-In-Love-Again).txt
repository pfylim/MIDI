Title  : BACK IN LOVE AGAIN

(Words & music: Len Ron Hanks/Zane Grey)

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
Every time I turn around
I'm back in love

I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me, I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know

Chorus 1:
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
Back in love again
Do do do do do
Back in love

When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
I just can't, I can't decide

Chorus 2:
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
Right back, right back, in love again
Seems like, seems like I'm back in love again

I was once your lover
Now it's hard to be your friend
There's something else I discovered
I guess I just don't ever want it to end

Chorus 1: ...

Chorus 2: ...
