COUPLE DAYS OFF - HUEY LEWIS AND THE NEWS


I like my job
And I don't mind the work
But eleven out of twelve
Is bound to hurt
The pay's pretty good
And the benefits are fine
But I got a little girl
And I wanna make her mine
I don't mind tellin'
You I get a little mad
To get a bit ahead
Takes all the time I have
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not gettin' soft
All I want is a couple days off

I don't need another
High song to sing
I don't need a shiny
New diamond ring
I don't need to meet nobody else
I just need a little time for myself
'Cuz I am only human
I am no machine
I need a little R and R
If you know what I mean
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not gettin' soft
All I want is a couple days off

I don't need another
Long coffee break
I had as much coffee
As aman can take
I need to change my disposition
Change my point of view
I need time to figure out
What I'm gonna do
Believe me when I tell you
It gets a little rough
We work a little harder
But it never is enough
I'm not afraid
To say I'm a total loss
All I want is a couple days off   
akt this is the
cult of snap
