Title  : COME AWAY

(Words & music: Leal/Lucia/Lewis)

Come away, come away, come away
To the Southsea Caribbean Island
Come away, come away, come away
To the place where the living is for fun (2x)

I had to get up early
No time for breakfast
Then I just get so hungry
Working at my job I think I've had enough
Of the crowded city crew
I guess I've had enough
But I haven't had enough of you

I hear the island calling
Each day and the night time
I see a star is shining
And now is the right time
To think we could be swimming
And lying on a beach
And we could be drinking
All the juices from the coconut tree
