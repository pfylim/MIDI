Singer : LIBERATION OF MAN 
Title  : YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE

(Words & music: Mol/Bergman/Veerhoff/Van Prehn/Hessing/Flint)

Hey baby when you look at me
I see it all in harmony
Oh, is this reality, please tell me
I saw a lot of girls, 'cause I've travelled much
But since the day I've found you baby
I just can't get enough

You say you never compromise
But I'm telling you no lies
What's that mystery in your eyes
Please tell me
Is it the game of love, where you are thinking of
You keep me moving baby
I just can't get enough

Refrain:
Oh, you're so important to me
You're my number one
Oh, you're so important to me
You're the only one

Oh when you get very close to me
No other place I wanna be
This got to be my destiny
Please tell me
Let the music turn you on
The night will soon be gone
But don't worry baby
'Cause my love for you is so strong

Refrain: ...

Oh, I touch the sky for you
All you want me to do
Oh, my love is so true
Believe me baby it's up to you

Refrain: ...

Hey baby when you look at me
I see it all in harmony
Oh, is this reality, please tell me
I saw a lot of girls, 'cause I've travelled much
But since the day I've found you baby
I just can't get enough
