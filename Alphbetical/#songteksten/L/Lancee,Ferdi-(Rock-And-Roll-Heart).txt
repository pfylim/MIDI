Title  : ROCK AND ROLL HEART

(Words & music: Frank Klunhaar)

We played all night in the morning light
Amused the people made them feel alright
A travelin' band but I just don't understand
Why I left home leaving you all alone
Tears in my eyes telling words of lies
A last goodbye dark clouds in the sky

Refrain:
It's the reward for a rock and roll heart
Tried so hard but we had to part
Rock and roll heart head it from the start
I'll pay you the price it's my sacrifice

If you want some instant love
I got it
If you want an instant smile
I got it
But I'm still counting the days
Since I went away
Still remember you beggin' me to stay

Refrain: ...
