(Words & music: Gary DeCarlo/Dale Frashuer/Paul Leka)

Chorus:
Na na na na (2x)
Hey hey hey, goodbye

He'll never love you the way that I love you
'Cause if he did, no no, he wouldn't make you cry
He might be thrilling, baby, but my love's so doggone willing
So kiss him, go on and kiss him goodbye

Chorus: ...2x...

he's never near you
To comfort and cheer you
When all those sad tears are falling, baby, from your eyes
He might be thrilling, baby, but my love's so doggone willing
So kiss him, go on and kiss him goodbye

Chorus: ...2x...
