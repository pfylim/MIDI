  5. ICE IN THE SUNSHINE (LANGNESE-WERBUNG)
  
  Like ice in the sunshine
  Like ice in the sunshine
  I'm melting away
  On a sunny day.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine 
  Like ice in the sunshine
  I'm melting away
  On a sunny day.
  
  When you are alone on the beach
  See the boys and girls hand in hand
  Relax in the midday heat
  With an ice-cream in your hand.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine
  Like ice in the sunshine
  I'm melting away
  On a sunny day.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine 
  Like ice in the sunshine
  I'm melting away
  On a sunny day.
  
  If you want to have some fun
  Feeling groovy down by the sea
  Lay down in the summer sun
  Feel the good vibration with me.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine
  Like ice in the sunshine
  I'm melting away
  On a sunny day.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine (sunshine) 
  Like ice in the sunshine (sunshine)
  I'm melting away (sunshine)
  On a sunny day.(sunshine)
  
  When you're at the ocean base
  See the surfers flying on a ridge
  Have fun on a sunny day
  With an ice-cream on the beach.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine (sunshine)

  On a sunny day.
  
  Like ice in the sunshine (sunshine)
