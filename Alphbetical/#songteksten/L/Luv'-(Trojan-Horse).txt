Title  : TROJAN HORSE

(Words & music: Janschen & Janschens)

You came in through the door, like a Trojan Horse
You came on to the floor, like a Trojan Horse
You looked around and saw me
But your eyes remained the same
But soon you would show more, like a Trojan Horse
La la la la la la la

Chorus:
Come on now one, two three
You're gonna dance with me
One, two, three, four, five
You say I'll be your wife

You move a little fast
Now wait a little while
If you want to last
You show a little style

The gates are not yet opened
So the horse can't come in
When you tell a happy story
At the beginning you begin

Chorus: ...

You got to take your time
I don't know what's on your mind
Like a Trojan Horse
Like a Trojan Horse
You came, you saw, you conquered
But you move a little fast
You made your plan just fine
Like a Trojan Horse
La la la la la la la la la
