Singer : LOS ALEGRES 
Title  : YES, I DO LIKE YOUR BERMUDA

(Words & music: W. Stips/Reyckjavick)

As I walk in my bermuda
See the sun and I see you there
you came walking up to me
And we danced into the sea
Feel the sunshine on my head it's summertime
Yes, I do like your bermuda
You like mine

Somewhere laying in the shade
Think we are coming home too late
Mr. Pepper and his band
Take us down to lover's land
Feel the sunshine on my head it's summertime
Yes, I do like your bermuda
You like mine

Somewhere laying in the shade
Think we are coming home too late
Mr. Pepper and his band
Take us down to lover's land
