Title  : FUNKY TOWN

(Words & music: Steve Greenberg)

Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
Town to get me movin', keep me groovin' with some energy
Well, I talk about it, talk about, talk about it
Talk about it, talk about it, talk about moving
Gotta move on, gotta move on, gotta move on

Won't you take me to funky town?
Won't you take me to funky town?
Won't you take me to funky town?
Won't you take me to funky town?
Wont you take me down to funky town?
Wont you take me down to funky town?
Won't you take me to funky town?
Won't you take me to funky town?
