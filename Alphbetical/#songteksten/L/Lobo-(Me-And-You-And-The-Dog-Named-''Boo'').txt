                        ME AND YOU AND A DOG NAMED "BOO"     

     As performed by: Lobo                                                                  


     I remember to this da-ay....the bright red..Georgia clay-ay....
     and how it stuck to the ti-iles..after the summer rain.....
     Will-power made that old car go-o,...
     a woman's mind told me that's so-o....
     Oh, how I wish we were..back on the roa-oad again..........

     Me an' you an' a dog named "Boo",...
     travellin' an' livin' off the la-and....
     Me an' you an' a dog named "Boo",
     how I love bein'..a free-- man..........

     Now I can still reca-all...the wheat fields of St. Pau-aul,....
     an' the mornin'..we got caught..robbin' from an' o-old hen........
     Old McDonald, he made us wor-ork,...
     but then he paid us..for what it was wor-orth.....
     Another tank o' gas an'..back on the roa-oad again........

     Me and you an' a dog named "Boo",...
     travellin' an' livin' off the la-and...
     Me an' you an' a do-og named "Boo",
     how I love bein'..a free-- man........

     Now I'll never forget the da-ay...
     we motored, stately into..Big L.A-a....
     The lights of the city put settlin' down..in my brain......
     Though it's only been a month or so-o,...
     that old car's buggin' us to..go-o...
     We gotta get away an' get..back on the roa-oad again.....

     Me an' you an' a dog named "Boo",...
     travellin' an' livin' off the la-and...
     Me an' you an' a do-og named "Boo",
     how I love bein'..a free-- man....

     Me an' you an' a dog named "Boo",...
     travellin' an' livin' off the la-and...
     Me and you an' a do-og named "Boo",
     how I love bein'..a free-ee ma-a-an....

     Me and you an' a dog named "Boo",..
     travellin' an' a livin' off the la-and...
     Me an' you an' a dog...
