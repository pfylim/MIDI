Singer : LOU & THE HOLLYWOOD BANANAS 
Title  : KINGSTON, KINGSTON

(Words & music: Alan Ward/Lou)

Took a cruise to the Caribbean
My yacht made a stop in Jamaica just 'cause it was hot
Took my can of red stripe and adventure into the night
So we danced reggae till light

Chorus:
Kingston, Kingston
Kingston, Kingston

Sipping rum and daily gleaner on my knee
Watched the girls on the sun-deck tan their body
Man, it took me some time to take my eyes off behind
Her skin was blacker than mine

They walked by and a smile, it set my heart alight
Put their arms all around me, should I start a fight
Cried out, what should I do
She said, we'll look after you
You praise Jah when we are through

Like a bull in a pen, a lion in his den
Man, I stayed with the dark girls till I don't know when
Now if you think that I'm bad
It might just be you are sad
About the fun that I had
