LUV' - WELCOME TO MY PARTY

(Words & music: R. Sommer/M. Schimschemer/J. van Katwijk)

Hey boy (hey boy) I wanna know it it's true
You take out a girl and make her feel brand new
Hey boy (hey boy) the talk's all over town
That you are the guy if you wanna get down
'Cause I'm sure to find out if what they say is alright

Oh you are always welcome to my party
To my party, baby don't hesitate
Yeah, you are always welcome to my party
To my party, baby don't make me wait

For so long (so long) I've been waiting for you
For somebody special, yeah someone like you
So long (so long) I've been wondering why
It took me so long to find that special guy
Now it seems that I don't have to look anymore
Did I find exactly what I've been waiting for

Oh you are always welcome to my party
To my party, come and set me free
Yeah, you are always welcome to my party
To my party, baby here's the key

You're always welcome to my world of fun
We'll have a good time until the morning sun
And baby in the morning light
The future will look so fresh and bright

Oh you are always welcome to my party
To my party, baby don't hesitate
Yeah, you are always welcome to my party
To my party, baby don't make me wait
