
12. SCHWARZ GREIFT EIN - JOHNNY LOGAN

So many times I thought of leaving.
Packing my bags and slip away.
I close my eyes and see my freedom.
A different world where I could stay.
But then I`d stop. I do always hesitate.
I`d see confusion in those eyes.
I realize you have to keep your faith.
I know I never say goodbye.
 
Chorus:
But I`m no hero. More like a fool in paradise. 
I`m no hero who chose to sacrifice.
I`m no hero. I`m no angel in disguise.
I`m just a dreamer who had to realize.
That beneath the brightest light.
Some people have to fight to survive.
But I`m no hero.

So many times I stopped leaving.
I needed help to carry on.
So I reached for you for one more reason.
The power of love to make me strong.
And you picked me up when I kept falling down.
You put my feet on higher ground.

Chorus

To stay alive.
I`m no hero.
I`m no hero.
