Title  : I've Been Thinking About You
Singer : Londonbeat



Hey hey hey
We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you baby
And I got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love, oh baby
What can I do

I've been thinking about you (4x)

Hey suddenly we're strangers
I watched you walking away
She was my one temptation
I did not want her to stay
Deep down I'm still confused about you
Oh yes I am baby
I feel so in love
Oh baby what can I do

I've been thinking about you (3x)
Oh yeah
I've been thinking about you
Got you on my mind
I've been thinking about you (3x)
Got you on my mind
Hey hey what good is being here without you
I want to know
I feel so in love oh baby what can I do
I've been thinking about you (4x)
Can't get you off my mind
You're with me baby all the time
Thinking about you (2x)
On my mind
Thinking about you
