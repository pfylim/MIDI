  6. IF THIS IS IT - HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS
  
  I'VE BEEN PHONING NIGHT AND MORNING
  I HEARD YOU SAY "TELL HIM I'M NOT HOME"
  NOW YOU'RE CONFESSING, BUT I'M STILL GUESSING
  I'VE BEEN YOUR FOOL FOR SO SO LONG
  GIRL DON'T LIE, JUST TO SAY MY FEELINGS
  GIRL DON'T CRY, AND TELL ME NOTHING'S WRONG
  GIRL DON'T TRY TO MAKE UP PHONEY REASONS
  I'D RATHER LEAVE THAN NEVER BELIEVE...
  
  CHORUS:
  IF THIS IS IT
  PLEASE LET ME KNOW
  IF THIS AIN'T LOVE YOU BETTER LET ME GO
  IF THIS IS IT
  I WANT TO KNOW
  IF THIS AIN'T LOVE BABY, JUST SAY SO
  
  YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
  AND I'VE BEEN DRINKING
  WE BOTH KNOW THAT IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT
  NOW YOU'RE PRETENDING
  THAT IT'S NOT ENDING
  YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING TO AVOID A FIGHT
  GIRL DON'T LIE, AND TELL ME THAT YOU NEED ME
  GIRL DON'T CRY, AND TELL ME NOTHING'S WRONG
  I'LL BE ALRIGHT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER
  SO LET ME GO OR MAKE ME WANT TO STAY...
  
  CHORUS
