Title  : Fortune Fairytales
Singer : Lo‹s Lane


Heard the news, there's a story going 'round
For all I know
It's a lie, they say you made a fortune and ran away
With a girl
A princess in a white silk gown, Ahaha
Fairytales, you didn't even care to say goodbye
I wake up and I see
Sun lights up your face
And I touch and I feel
It's all a dream

Chorus:
In a sleeping world nothing seem absurd
Fortune fairytales rolling by in a frame
When you wake it has passed and gone

Had the luck, I found the perfect stranger
To take me home
To a place so filled with diamonds
I had to close my eyes
Was locked up far away
Tears ran down my face
I wake up and I see
It's all a dream

Chorus

Gone when you wake it has passed and gone

Chorus
