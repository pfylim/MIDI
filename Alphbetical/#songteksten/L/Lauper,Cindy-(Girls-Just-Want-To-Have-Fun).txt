CYNDI LAUPER - GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN


I come home in the morning light
My mother says when you gonna live your life right
Oh momma dear we're not the fortunate ones
And girls just wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells what you gonna do with your life
Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one
But girls just wanna have fun
Oh girls wanna have

Refrain:
That's all they really want some fun
When the working is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
(Girls they wanna, wanna have fun
girls wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

Refrain: ...(2x)...
