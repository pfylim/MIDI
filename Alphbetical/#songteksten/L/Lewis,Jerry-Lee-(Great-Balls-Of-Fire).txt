  1. Great Balls Of Fire - Jerry Lee Lewis
  
  You shake my nerves
  And you rattle my brain
  Too much love
  Drives a man insane
  You broke my will
  But what a thrill
  Goodness gracious
  Great balls of fire.
  
  Ah, let you love
  But I thought it was funny
  You came along
  And moved me, honey
  I've changed my mind
  This looks fine
  Goodness gracious
  Great balls of fire.
  
  Kiss me baby
  Mmm feels good
  Hold me, baby
  Well, I'm off to love you
  Like a lover should
  You're fine 
  So kind
  Like to tell this world 
  That you're mine...
