Singer : LIMOUSINE 
Title  : SEVENTY FIVE

If you're tired of life
'Cos nothing's going right
You don't seem to find the answers
To all your questions inside
This big cruel world is falling down on you
And there's no one to help you out of the blue
But don't give up you must try to be strong
For people like you I'm singin' this song

Refrain:
Seventy-five, a year to change your life
Seventy-five, a year to stand up and fight
Come together there's a new day
Come together see a new day
One for all and all for one
Help each other remember this song yeah
Help each other remember this song yeah

You and me, he and she must try to change this world
So many things to be done by every boy and girl
Be like God planned us to be
He made this world peaceful and free
Everywhere people try to ruin this world
Shooting our soldiers and raping our girls

Refrain: ...
