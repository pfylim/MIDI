        Woman         John Lennon


Woman, I can hardly express
my mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness.
After all I'm forever in your debt.
And woman, I will try to express 
my inner feelings and thankfulness
for showing me the meaning of success.

Ooh, well, well, Doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh, well, well, Doo doo doo doo doo
Woman, please let me explain,
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain.
So let me tell you again and again and again:
I love you, yeah, yeah, now and forever.

Woman, I know you understand
the little child inside the man.
Please remember my life in your hands.
And woman, hold me close to your heart.
However distant, don't keep us apart.
After all, it is written in the stars.

Ooh, well, well, Doo doo doo doo doo
Ooh, well, well, Doo doo doo doo doo
Woman, please let me explain,
I never meant to cause you sorrow or pain.
So let me tell you again and again and again:
I love you, yeah, yeah, now and forever.
