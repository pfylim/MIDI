Singer : LUCIFER 
Title  : I CAN SEE THE SUN IN LATE DECEMBER

I bet ya you can't even see the sun
But the sun is shining right before our eyes
I bet ya you can't even see yourself
'Cause when you're lost sometimes yourself is
hard to find

I can see the sun in late december
I see forgotten treasures neath the sea
That defeat divinity washing away the
Beauty that was in our mind

I bet ya you can't even see the moon
'Cause through your eyes you only see the darkest sight
I bet ya you can't wish upon a star
'Cause your pride has past your dreams aside
I can hear the sound you don't remember
The sound of birds and trees in harmony
Chords being blown by a gentle breeze
Making the perfect melody you left behind
