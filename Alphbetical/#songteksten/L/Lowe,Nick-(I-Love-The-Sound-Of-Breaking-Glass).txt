Title  : I LOVE THE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS

(Words & music: Lowe/Bodnar/Goulding)

I love the sound of breaking glass
Especially when I'm lonely
I need the noises of destruction
When there's nothing new
Oh, nothing new
The sound of breaking glass

I love the sound of breaking glass
Deep into the night
I love the sound of its condition
Flying all around
Oh, all around
The sound of breaking glass
Nothing new
The sound of breaking glass

Oh, all around
The sound of breaking glass
Nothing new
The sound of breaking glass
Save at last
The sound of breaking glass

I love the sound of breaking glass
Deep into the night
I love to work on anything new
Our change of mind
Change of mind
The sound of breaking glass
All around
The sound of breaking glass
Nothing new
The sound of breaking glass
Breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
The sound of breaking glass
