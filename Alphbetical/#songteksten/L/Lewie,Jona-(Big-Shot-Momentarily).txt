If you've got the cheek and wanna be awfully awfuly neat
and wanna be taken to your seat you'd better consider.
If you want to sell and wanna be awfully awfully swell
and wanna be at the Ritz Hotel where you'll be bigger.

Big shot - they tell me that's what I could be
Big shot - they tell me that's what I could be
But it's - momentarily
you know it's - momentarily
they put you in a wigwam
and make you do it on a programme on T.V.
you're gonna be on T.V. T.V.
you're gonna be on the silver screen
you're gonna be knighted by the queen
you're gonna be rich and awfully mean
you're gonna be what they call the scene
you're gonna be noticed where you've been
you're gonna be, oh, you're gonna be, oh, too much.

If you wanna be King you've gotta be awfully awfully keen
you've gotta be taken where you've been you've gotta be noticed.
Everywhere you go you're gonna be talking on the phone
they're gonna be nothing where you go you're gonna be posted.

Big shot - they tell me that's what I could be...

They'll put you in a wigwam
and make you do it on a programm on T.V.
Big shot - big shot
but it's momentarily
you know it's momentarily
you know it's momentarily,...
