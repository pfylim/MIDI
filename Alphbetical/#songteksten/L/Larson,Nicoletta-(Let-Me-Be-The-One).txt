I should at be so hard for a man.
Only once to do the best you can.    
It's so easy to see but why can't let be.
Freedoms girl are append.           

So little fay no rainbow sain,
He keeps looking just and run away.
Hold on me I can allredy see.
In your eyes - paradise.

Let me be the one, take me to the star.
Take this dream no one else can take it away.
You can hold it by the way.
Be for me the one, be my only heart.
Here I am let me hear my heart away.
This is where I want to stay.

How long can you run,
Can you every known the sun.
Will you early ending when enough.
I wanna know you I wanna show you,
Darling every day,
Just pick up on you without all.
