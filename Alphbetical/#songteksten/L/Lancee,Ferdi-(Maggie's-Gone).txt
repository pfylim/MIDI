Title  : MAGGIE'S GONE

(Words & music: Ferdi Lancee)

Sitting in the waiting room
Waiting for the train
Don't know where she's going to
She just wants to go away
The train arrived and she got in
She cried the night away
Until the morning came at last
To start a bright new day
She left a note for mum and dad
In which she wrote so long
I love you both but I have left
To find a life of my own

Maggie's gone, Maggie's gone
Maggie's gone away
Maggie thinks she's got it made
A brand new start today
Maggie's gone, Maggie's gone
Maggie's gone away
Maggie thinks she's got it made
A brand new start, a brand new start
A brand new start

Maggie's gone but it took so long
She's finally got away
She tried so hard and now it shows
A brand new start today
She left a note for mum and dad
In which she wrote so long
I love you both but I have left
To find a life of my own

Maggie's gone, Maggie's gone
Maggie's gone away
Maggie thinks she's got it made
A brand new start today
Maggie's gone, Maggie's gone
Maggie's gone away
Maggie thinks she's got it made
A brand new start, a brand new start
A brand new start
