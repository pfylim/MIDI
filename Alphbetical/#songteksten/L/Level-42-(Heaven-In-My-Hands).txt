LEVEL 42 - HEAVEN IN MY HANDS

(Words & music: M. King/B. Gould)

Hey yeah, hey yeah
I'm going nowhere
Gotta face up to it
Gotta wake up to it
I feel so guilty
Killing time is a sin
There's no way you can win
A dam burst of dreams flows through me
They show me where I could be
Flashpoint feelings flow
Through my mind moving

From the mountain to the sea
I'll run across this land
Looking out for strength and beauty
A diamond in the sand
I will chase the four winds over
Trying to understand
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands

I won't let nobody
Turn me off the track
Now there's no turning back
Won't let no worries
Turn my head inside out
Now there's no room for doubt
I'm heading for my destiny
And if feels electric to me
Flashpoint feelings flow
Through my head

I was lonely going nowhere
Drowning on dry land
I was almost stranded there
A shipwreck on the sand
But now I'll chase the whole world over
Making my demands
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands
Hey yeah

From the mountain to the sea
I'll run across this land
Hoping you're anywhere
Looking out for strength and beauty
A diamond in the sand
I will chase the four winds over
Trying to understand

And my baby's stopping me
And I won't stop until I'm holding
Heaven in my hands
I was lonely going nowhere
Drowning on dry land

And I was a shipwreck
I was almost stranded there
A shipwreck on the sand
And I will go anywhere
But now I'll chase the whole world over
Making my demands
