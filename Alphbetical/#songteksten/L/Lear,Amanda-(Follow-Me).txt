Singer : AMANDA LEAR 
Title  : FOLLOW ME

(Words & music: A. Lear/A. Monn)

I'm getting out, I'm moving on
And from now on, address unknown
I should be difficult to find
So follow me, just follow me

I'll sell you dreams and new desires
I'm trading hopes, I'm opened
I am the night, I am your fate
So follow me, just follow me

Faust was right, have no regret
Gimme your soul, I'll give you life
And all the things, you want to get
So follow me, just follow me

I'll give you wings, I'll sell you fame
Merry-go-round, maybe to hell
I am the key to your problem
So follow me, just follow me

Unbelievable maybe
You'll have a new identity
For a second of vanity
I want to change your destiny

Unbelievable maybe
You'll have a new identity
For a second of vanity
I want to change your destiny

Follow me, follow me
I'll give you anything you want
Your wish is my command
If you agree to follow me
