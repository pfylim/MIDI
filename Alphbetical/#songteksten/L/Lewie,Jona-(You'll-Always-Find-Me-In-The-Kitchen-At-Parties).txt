Title  : YOU'LL ALWAYS FIND ME IN THE KITCHEN AT PARTIES

(Words & music: Jona Lewie/Keith Trussell)

I'm no good at chatting up and I always get rebuffed
Enough to drive a man to drink, I don't do no washing up
I always leave the stuff piled up, a piled up in the sink

But you will always find him in the kitchen at parties

My and my girlfriend, we arrived and she ran away from home
She must 'of found somebody new and now I'm all alone
Living on my own
What am I supposed to do?

That's why you'll always find him in the kitchen at parties

Then I met this debutante, I said: I like new wave rock
She was into French cuisine, but I ain't no cordon bleu
This was at some do in Palmers Green
I had no luck with her
You will still find him in the kitchen at parties
