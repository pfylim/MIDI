Singer : LONG TALL ERNIE & THE SHAKERS 
Title  : GOLDEN YEARS OF ROCK'N'ROLL

(Words & music: A. Treffers/A.J. Britnell)

Chorus:
Golden years of rock and roll
Every Saturday we had a ball
Dancing and swaying while the bands were playing
Golden years of rock and roll

Petticoats spun, stiletto heals run
Saturday nights were a whole lot of fun
Had a good time
Drinking milkshakes and wine
The jukebox played and only needed a dime

Chorus: ...

Cherry, cherry baby (3x)
Cherry, can you come out tonight
Maddy told Harry about the thing she saw
I do the big horn like a woolly dog, woolly boolly

Yeah, that's  right, woolly boolly

Never been late for my latest date
In my daddy's car we didn't have to wait
We kissed in the back and there was Wolfman Jack
Moving and grooving to the latest track

Chorus: ...

Buona sera, signorita, buona sera
It's time to say goodnight to Napoli
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera
With that old moon above the mediterranean sea
In the meantime let me tell you that I love you
Buona sera, signorita, kiss me goodnight

Slippin' and slidin'
Peepin' and hidin'
Been told a long time ago (2x)

I've been told baby, you have been bold
Ain't gonna be your fool no more

Golden years of rock and roll

You can rock and you can roll
Do the stomp and even stroll it at the hop
When the record's spinning, you calypso
When you're chickin' at the hop

Do the dance sensation that's sweepin' the nation at the hop
Let's go to the hop, yeah baby (4x)
