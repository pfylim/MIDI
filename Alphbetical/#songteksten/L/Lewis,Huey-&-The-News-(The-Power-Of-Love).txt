HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS - THE POWER OF LOVE

The power of love is a curious thing
Make one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling
That's the power of love

Tougher than diamonds, bricks like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, make a wrong one right
Power of love that keep you home at night

Refrain:
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go 'round

Refrain: ...

And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
But you know what to do when it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it
Hmmmm

Refrain: ...

It don't take money, and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
But you won't feel nothin' 'til you feel
You feel the power of love
Just feel the power of love
That's the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love
