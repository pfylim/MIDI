Title  : GET YOURSELF TOGETHER

Get yourself together
Get yourself together
Fly with me baby reach for the sky
There ain't no bad weather for you and I
You and me baby got the world in our hand
When we're together ain't love grand
Get yourself together
Get yourself together
Baby it's gonna be like this
Come on sugar
Get yourself together
Get yourself together

Come on lover I'm taking you higher
Keep close to me honey, I'm the cosmic flyer
We're up here, with the world down below
Hold me tight satellite, now you know
Baby it's gonna be like this
Come on sugar
Get yourself together
Get yourself together

Baby I'm on fire, don't let me go
Like a ro deet ship I'm on a trip for ever more
We're up here, with the world down below
Hold me tight satellite, now you know
Baby it's gonna be like this
Come on sugar
Get yourself together
Get yourself together
