NICK LOWE - HALF A BOY AND HALF A MAN

You'd better run, you'd better hide
You'd better lock your house and keep
The kids inside
Here comes the 20th century latest scam
He's half a boy and half a man

He ain't a fool, but he's a tool
Because his left don't know what his
right hand's doin'
He'd keep a King Kong eating out of the
palm of his hand
But he's half a boy and half a man

Best be the fleet upon your feet
Or else the SPG's gonna be clearing the streets
They never made no provision in the original plan
For half a boy and half a man

Oh, when his fingers do the walking
In the middle of the night
When his people stalk in
Baby let me tell you, nothing comes out right

Best be the fleet upon your feet
Oh, when his fingers do the walking
You'd better run, you'd better hide
