Title  : Nobody Told Me
Singer : John Lennon


Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom
Just below the stairs
Always something happening
And nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China
So finish what you got

Chorus:
Nobody told me there'd be days like these (3x)
Strange days indeed - most peculiar, mama

Everybody's running and no one makes a move
Everyone's a winner and no one seems to lose
There's a little yellow idol
To the north of Katmandu
Everybody's flying
And no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying
No one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies
You just gotta stay around

Chorus

Everybody's smoking no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFO's over New York
And I ain't too surprised

Chorus
