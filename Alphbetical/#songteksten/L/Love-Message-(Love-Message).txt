1. LOVE MESSAGE - LOVE MESSAGE

Chorus
We are sending out 
A love message to the world.
A love message to the world.
Can you hear the message of love.
We are sending out 
A love message to the world.
A love message to the world.
Can you hear the message of love.

Please save your life.
Save your life.
Love message.

Loosen up `cause it`s about time.
Love and sex felt just no fine.
From Aids disease but a little late.
It`s serious and it`s no game.
Everybody needs information.
Here and there in every nation.
Go up have fun but trust no luck.
Protect yourself get up and suck.

Ding didi ding didi ding ding dong.
All the people in the world think wrong.
Keep control donït drive to fast.
Save your soul and make it last.
HIV is my worry.
Rather be safe than sorry.
Awareness of what`s going on.
Do the right thing, put it on.

Chorus

Love message, can you feel it.
Love message, can you see it.
Love message.
Can you hear the message of love.
Love message
Love message, can you feel it.
Love message, can you see it.
Love message.
Can you hear the message of love.

Yeah. Save your life.
Love message.

Love, love, love is all around.
Don`t forget it if you found
Someone for satisfaction.
Do think first and use protection.
Sex, sex, sex is fun
But don`t be silly.
Use a Billy Boy.
Don`t break your hands.
Trust those words `cause we are friends.
Friends oh friend and you can think.
But please be aware of HIV.
It`s a free nilly illness 
But boy you pay.
For you or me to take Z to A.
Pass the word around don`t be dumb.
You wanna make love
Then you better use a condom.
Now it`s time to put a stop.
Protect your friend 
If you wanna be on top.

Chorus

Love message, can you feel it.
Love message, can you see it.
Love message.
Can you hear the message of love.
