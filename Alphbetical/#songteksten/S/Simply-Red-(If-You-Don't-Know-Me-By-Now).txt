SIMPLY RED - IF YOU DON'T KNOW ME BY NOW

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me ooh

All the things that we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Oh, don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
'Cause we only act like children

If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (no you won't) ooh
If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (no you won't) ooh

We all got
Our own funny moods
I've got mine
Woman you got yours too
Just trust in me
Like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye oh

If you don't know me by now (if you don't know me)
You will never never never know me (no you won't) ooh
If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me ooh ooh
If you don't know me by now ooh
(You will never never never know me) ooh
