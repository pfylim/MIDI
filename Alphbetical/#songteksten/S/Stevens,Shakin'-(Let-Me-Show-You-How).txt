Well, you're gonna boogie woogie and you know it's right,
you want to rock 'N' roll all through the night,
oooh-ee, baby ooh-ee baby now.
Well, c'mon baby, let me show you how.

You wore a clinging dress that fit so tight,
you slid up to me and it felt so right.
Oooh-ee, baby ooh-ee baby now.
Well, c'mon baby, let me show you how.

Now you've got the fever, and you're feelin' hot,
you want to give a lot of what you've got,
oooh-ee, baby ooh-ee baby now.
Well, c'mon baby, let me show you how.

You wore a clinging dress that fit so tight,
you slid up to me and it felt so right.
Oooh-ee, baby ooh-ee baby now.
Well, c'mon baby, let me show you how.
