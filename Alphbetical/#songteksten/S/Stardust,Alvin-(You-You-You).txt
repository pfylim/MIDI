Title  : YOU YOU YOU

You you you are all I live for
'Cause no one needs you like I do
I want you you you 'cause you I'd die for
I love you always, love me do

Little doll in my dreams almost lost you
Now I'll never go to sleep until you're near
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You you you are all I care for
I love you always, love me do

You you you are all I live for
'Cause no one needs you like I do
I want you you you 'cause you I'd die for
I love you always, love me do

Little doll in my dreams almost lost you
Now I'll never go to sleep until you're near
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You you you are all I'd die for
I love you always, love me too like I do
I love you always, want me too, want me too
I'll never find another girl like
You you you are all I live for
Honey please I'm so helpless without you
I want you you you're the one I'd die for
I can't help it, so love me too

I need you you you are all I live for
Honey please I'm so helpless without you
I want you you you're the one I'd die for
I can't help it, so love me too
