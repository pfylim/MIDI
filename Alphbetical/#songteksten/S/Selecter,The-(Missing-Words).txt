Title  : MISSING WORDS

(Words & music: N. Davies)

Last night when I told you
All that stuff about the way things are
You didn't understand a word
But you said you did
Now I'm not the honest Joe I might seem
I can't take your lies
It's late I'm tired
Your words just crackle along the wire

Chorus:
It's all over now
It's all over now
You thought you had it made
It's over, it's over

It just don't make sense
The way you did the things you did
You might have thought that I was dumb
But now I'm all wised up
Game's up, move on
Why don't you get out of my hair
I wonder if you ever did really care
