Title  : WOMAN IN LOVE
Artist : BARBRA STREISAND

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb)

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
It's a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall, but I give you it all

Chorus:
I am a woman in love
And I'd do anything
To get into my world
And hold you within'
It's a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do? (2x)

I am a woman in love
And I'm talking to you
I know how you feel,
What a woman can do
It's a right I defend
Over and over again

Chorus: ...

With you eternally mine is love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away, you feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever to lie, I stumble and fall
But I give you it all

Chorus: ...
