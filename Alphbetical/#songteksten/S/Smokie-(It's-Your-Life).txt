Title  : IT'S YOUR LIFE

(Words & music: Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman)

Who said the web of life was woven in a dream
'Cause your life is filled with dreams you can't believe
So the only way you live with it is acting every scene
And you play the part so well but who's deceived

Now and again you'll find you ain't got a friend
Who knows I come and I go

Refrain:
But it's your life
It's your life
Said it's your life

World is overcrowded you'll still found an empty place
And I know it leaves you helpless and confused
And your search for love has often left you staring into space
Just another broken heart so what's the use

How many times have I been so hard to find
You know I come and I go

Refrain: ...

Though the how does it feel
When he's not around
Can he be real
When he can't be found nowhere

Who lit the flame upon the candle tonight
And who let herself be led so easily
Who let it burn until the early morning light
And in the early morning gave herself to me

And so at last you know

Refrain: ...

That it's your life
It's your life
Said it's your life

Refrain: ...
