Title  : NOBODY DOES IT BETTER

(Words & music: Marvin Hamlish/Carole Bayer Sager)

Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby you're the rest

I wasn't looking but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

Nobody does it better
Sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Did you have to be so good

The way that you told me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it coming
You'd learn to do the things you do

And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, baby you're the best
