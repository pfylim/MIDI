       HEAVEN CAN WAIT        SANDRA


1) I saw your face an' you saw mine
   an' then we got much higher
   i can't deny you came in time 
   to set the night on fire
   close your eyes close your eyes an' say
   you're the one don't feel the same

Refrain:
An' heaven can wait cause you're my desire
heaven can wait you're turnin' up in time
so take up my heart livin' for this day of joy
it's never too late an' heaven can wait

2) I saw your eyes an' you saw mine
   you can not be a liar
   by day an' night saw what you like
   i'll keep my laove much higher
   close your eyes close your eyes an' say
   you're the one don't feel the same

Refrain:
An' heaven can wait cause you're my desire
heaven can wait you're turnin' up in time
so take up my heart livin' for this day of joy
it's never too late an' heaven can wait
