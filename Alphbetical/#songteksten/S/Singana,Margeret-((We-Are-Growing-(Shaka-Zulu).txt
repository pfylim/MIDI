MARGARET SINGANA - WE ARE GROWING (SHAKA ZULU)

(Words & music: Van Blerk/Singana/Laxton/Pollecut)

Hear the children
They are talking to you
Hear the wind blow
It is calling for you
See the grass grow
It whispers your name
See the fire glow
Your heart is the same

Be a man of greatness now
A man so tall, a man so kind
Be a man of wisdom now
A man of mind, a man not blind
Be a man of kindness now
A man so big and strong in mind
Be a man so humble now
A man of men now let it shine

This is what you are
This is what it was planned now
This is what to be
And what kind of man now
This is what to say
With what kind of meaning
This is what to feel
With what kind of feeling

We are growing young man, higher and higher
We are growing, higher and higher
He is growing, higher and higher
We are growing, higher and higher
