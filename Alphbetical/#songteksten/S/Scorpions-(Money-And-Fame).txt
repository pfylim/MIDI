You know nothing about loving
you lost somewhere down the line
you know nothing about giving
you should draw the line.

You keep looking out for something
something you're never gonna find
when will, will you show your feelings
you will lose your mind.

Who's to blame my love
you play a dangerous game
who's to blame my love
all you want is money and fame.

You play, play with emotions
you need, need a stepping stone
you're out, out for sensations
don't you, don't you feel alone.

Who's to blame my love
you play a dangerous game
who's to blame my love
all you want is money and fame.
