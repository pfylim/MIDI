4. YOU AND I - SCORPIONS

I lose control because of you babe.
I lose control when you look at me like this.
There`s something in your eyes
That is saying tonight.
I`m not a child anymore.
Love has opened the door.
To a new exciting life

It`s all written down
In your your lifelines.
It`s written down inside your heart

Chorus
You and I just have a dream.
To find our love a place
Where we can hide away.
You and I were just made
To love each other now
Forever and a day

I lose control because of you babe.
I lose control. Don`t look at me like this.
There`s something in your eyes
That is saying tonight.
I`m so curious for more
Just like never before
In my innocent life.

It`s all written down
In your your lifelines.
It`s written down inside your heart

Chorus

Time stands still
When the days of innocence.
Are falling for the night.
I love you girl I always will.
I swear I`m there for you
Till the day I die.

Chorus repeat and fade out
