Singer : SHEILA & THE BLACK DEVOTION
Title  : SPACER

(Words & music: Edwards/Rodgers)

He's a ladie's man
Always greets with a kiss on the hand
He protects us all
At the ready to answer our call

In his own special way he is gentle and kind
Oppression he hates
Love in his eyes
My heart skips a beat when I'm by his side

Chorus:
He's a spacer
Star chaser
A spacer

In our galaxy
You can't trust everyone that you meet
I'm so lucky
He's the only one I'll ever need

He will blast off tonight
He puts life on the line everytime he's in flight
A man you can't trace
But our love will last beyond time and space
