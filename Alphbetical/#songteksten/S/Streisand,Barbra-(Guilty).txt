Title  : GUILTY
Artist : BARBRA STREISAND

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

Shadows falling, baby
We stand alone out on the street
Anybody you meet, got a heartache of their own
Make it a crime to be lonely or sad
You got a reason for living, you battle on
With the love you're livin' on you gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day, just a matter of time

Chorus:
And we got nothing to be guilty of
Our love will climb any mountain, near or far we are
And we never let it end
We are devotion
And we got nothing to be sorry for
Our love is one in a million
Eyes can see that we got a highway to the sky
I don't wanna hear your goodbye

Pulse's racing, darling, how grand we are
Litlle by little we meet in the middle
There's danger in the dark
Make it a crime to be out in the cold
You got a reason for livin' in
You battle on with the love you're building on
You gotta be mine
We take it away
It's gotta be night and day,
Just a matter of time

Chorus: ...
