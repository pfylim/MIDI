Many's the time I've been mistaken
and many times confused
yes, and often felt forsaken
and certainly misused
but I'm all right, I'm all right
I'm just weary to my bones
still, you don't expect to be
bright and bon vivant
so far away from home,
so far away from home.

And I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
or driven to it's knees
but it's all right, it's all right
we've lived so well so long
still, when I think of the road
we're traveling on
I wonder what went wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what went wrong.

And I dreamed I was dying
and I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
and looking back down at me
smiled reassuringly
and I dreamed I was flying
and high up above my eyes could clearly see
the Statue of Liberty
sailing away to sea
and I dreamed I was flying.

We come on the ship they call the Mayflower
we come on the ship that sailed the moon
we come in the age's most uncertain hour
and sing an American tune
but it's all right, it's all right
you can't be forever blessed
still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
and I'm trying to get some rest
that's all I'm trying to get some rest.

I'm trying to get some rest ?
