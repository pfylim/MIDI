Singer : SLADE 
Title  : THE BANGIN' MAN 
 
When you wake up in the mornin' 
And you can't remember much about the night before 
Then the lady who's beside you gets up 
She goes right to the bathroom door 
And your head won't stop singin' 
The phone won't stop ringin' 
Your plane is gonna leave at twelve fifteen 
It was close to six o'clock before you 
Got to know a little dream 
 
Refrain: 
Look at the bangin' man he says he can 
Time after time 
He'll get down down to bangin' back home 
Oh look at the bangin' man he says he can 
Time after time 
He'll get down down to bangin' back home 
 
I been in fifty diff'rent towns 
In fifty diff'rent days they all got diff'rent names 
I been in fifty limousines in fifty hotelrooms 
You case needs unpackin' 
They all look the same 
And you won't stop crackin' 
The only sound is from the tv screen 
Until a knock comes on the door 
And standing there's another little dream 
 
Refrain: ... 
 
When you wake up in the mornin' 
And you can't remember much about the night before 
A small reminder of the state you were in 
Are all the tattered clothes across the floor 
And your head still keeps singin' 
The phone still keeps ringin' 
Remember just exactly where you've been 
'Coz there ain't no doubt about it 
There's no better things to see 
Than what you've seen 
 
Refrain: ...
