Why are these women here,
dancing on their own ?
Why is there this sadness in their eyes ?
Why are the soldiers here,
their faces fixed like stone ?
I can't see what it is that they despise.
They're dancing with the missing;
they're dancing with the dead.
They dance with the invisible ones;
their anguish is unsaid.
They're dancing with their fathers;
they're dancing with their sons.
they're dancing with their husbands;
they dance alone.
They dance alone.

The only form of protest they're alowed.
I've seen their silent faces, they screamed so loud.
If they were to speak these words,
they'd go missing too.
Another woman on the torture table.
What else can they do ?
They're dancing with the missing;
they're dancing with the dead.
They dance with the invisible ones;
their anguish is unsaid.
They're dancing with their fathers;
they're dancing with their sons.
they're dancing with their husbands;
they dance alone.
They dance alone.

One day we'll dance on their graves;
one day we'll sing our freedom.
One day we'll laugh in our joy, and we'll dance.

One day we'll dance on their graves;
one day we'll sing our freedom.
One day we'll laugh in our joy, and we'll dance.

(spoken)
Ellas danzan con los desaparecidos,
danzan con los muertos.
Danzan con amores invisibles.
Con silenciosa angistia.
Danzan con sus padres, con sus hijos,
con sus esposos.
Ellas Ddazan solas, danzan solas.

Hey, Mister Pinochet, you've sown a bitter crop.
It's foreign money that supports you;
one day the money's going to stop.
No wages for your torturers,
no budget for your guns.
Can you think of your own mother 
dancing with her invisible son?

They're dancing with the missing;
they're dancing with the dead.
They dance with the invisible ones;
their anguish is unsaid.
They're dancing with their fathers;
they're dancing with their sons.
they're dancing with their husbands;
they dance alone.
They dance alone.
