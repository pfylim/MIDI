So you think your schooling's phoney,
I guess it's hard not to agree.
You say it all depends on money,
and who is in your family tree.
Right, right, you're bloody well right,
you know you got a right to say Right,
you're bloody well right,
you know you got a right to say.

Ha ha, you're bloody well right,
you know your right to say.
Yeh, yeh, you're bloody well right,
you know your right to say
and me I don't care anyway.

Write your problems down in the datail,
take them to a higher place.
You've had cry no I shouldn't say wail,
in the mean time, hush your face.

You got a bloody right to say,
you got a bloody right to say.
