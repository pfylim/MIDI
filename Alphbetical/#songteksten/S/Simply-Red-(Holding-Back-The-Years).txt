SIMPLY RED - HOLDING BACK THE YEARS

Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of Peter
Hoping for the arms of Mater
Get to meet her sooner or later
I'll keep holding on
Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all
I've known
There's nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
Nothing had the change to be good
Nothing ever could
I'll keep holding on
I've wasted all those tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
Coz nothing ever could
Oh, I'll keep holding on
That's al I have today
That's all I have to say
