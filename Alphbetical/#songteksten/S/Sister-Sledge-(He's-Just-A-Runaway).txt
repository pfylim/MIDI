Title  : HE'S JUST A RUNAWAY
Artist : SISTER SLEDGE

(Words & music: Narada Michael Walden/Kathy Sledge)

Chorus:
He's just a runaway, runaway
He'll run and break your heart
He's just a runaway, runaway
He'll run and break your heart

She was standing there, all alone
Had no money left, love hangs on the phone
No one's home

It was Saturday, gettin' hot
Consciousness walked away
Can his heart be caught
Love is not bought
Still she wants

Chorus: ...2x...

Yes, he has honest eyes
And a lonely face
It happens everytime
Innocence lies
But the weekend pass on reality
Served to bring him back
Love was just an act for so long
Now he's gone

Chorus: ...4x...

Yes, he has honest eyes
And a lonely face
It happens everytime
Innocence lies
But the weekend pass on reality
Served to bring him back
Love was just an act for so long
Now he's gone

Chorus: ...5x...
