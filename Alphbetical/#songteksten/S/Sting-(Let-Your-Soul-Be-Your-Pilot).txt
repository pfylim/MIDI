3.  LET YOUR SOUL BE YOUR PILOT - STING

Let your soul be your pilot.
Let your soul guide you, 
He'll guide you well.

When you're down and they're counting,
When your secrets, all found out.
When your troubles, take to mounting,
When the map you have leads you to doubt.
When there's no information,
And the compass turns 
To nowhere that you know well.

Just let your soul be your pilot.
Let your soul guide you, 
He'll guide you well.

When the doctors failed to heal you,
When no medicine chest 
Can make you well.
When no counsel leads to comfort,
When there are no more lies, they can tell.
No more useless information,
And the compass spins,
The compass spins 
Between heaven and hell.

Just let your soul be your pilot.
Let your soul guide you, 
He'll guide you well.

And your eyes 
Turn towards the window pane,
To the lights upon the hill.
The distance seems so strange to you now,
And the dark room seems so still.

Let your pain, be my sorrow,
Let your tears, be my tears too.
Let your courage, be my model,
That the north you find, will be true.
When there's no information,
And the compass turns 
To nowhere, to nowhere 
That you know well.
Just let your soul be your pilot.
Let your soul guide you, 
Let your soul guide you, 
Let your soul guide you, 
He'll guide you well.

Let your soul guide you upon your way.
Let your soul guide you upon your way.
Let the soul guide you upon your way.
Let your soul guide you.
Let your soul guide you.
Let your soul guide you.
Let your soul guide you.

When the doctor failed to heal you,
Oh, there are so many lies they can tell.
No more useless information,
Trust your soul guide you,
Let your soul guide you,
Let your soul guide you,
Let your soul guide you,
Let your soul guide you.
Let your pain, be my sorrow,
Let your tears, be my tears too.
Let your courage, be my model,
That the north you find, 
That the north you find, will be true.
