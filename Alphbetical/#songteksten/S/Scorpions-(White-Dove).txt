
12. White Dove - Scorpions

A place without a name
Under a burnin' sky
There's no milk and honey here
In the land of god
Someone holds a sign, it says
We are human, too
And while the sun goes down
The world goes by

Chorus
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry

Waves big like a house
They're stranded on a piece of wood
To leave it all behind
To start again
But instead of a new life
All they find is a door that's closed
And they keep lookin' for
A place called hope

Chorus
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry

Can anyone tell me why
The children of the world
Have to pay the price
And now you're telling' me
You've seen it all before
I know that's right
But still it breaks my heart
Well, the golden lamb
We've sent
Makes us feel better now
But you know it's just a drop
In a sea of tears

Chorus
White dove fly with the wind
Take our hope under your wings
For the world to know
That hope will not die
Where the children cry
