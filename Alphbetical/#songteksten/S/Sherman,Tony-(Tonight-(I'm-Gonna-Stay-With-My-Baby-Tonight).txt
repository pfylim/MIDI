Title  : (TONIGHT) I'M GONNA STAY WITH MY BABY TONIGHT

I'm gonna stay with my baby tonight
I'm gonna lay with my baby tonight

Ev'rything it looks alright
There's no trouble nowhere in sight
I'm gonna lay with my baby tonight

I'm gonna stay with my lover tonight
I'm gonna lay with my baby tonight
I'm gonna lay with my baby tonight

An' you know it's not the first time
Surely won't be the last
An' the future looks mighty fine for us
An' it's anything like tonight
An' you know it's getting better ev'ry day
An' if it's ever be a moment like tonight
