Title  : GHOST TOWN
Artist : SPECIALS

(Words & music: Jerry Dammers)

This town is coming like a ghost town
All the clubs have been closed down
Bands won't play no more
Too much fighting on the dance floor
Do you remember the good old days
Before the ghost town
We danced and sang as the music
Played in a de boomtown

This town is coming like a ghost town
Why must the youth fight against themselves
Governmet leaving the youth on the shelf
This town is coming like a ghost town
No job to be found in this country
Can't go on no more, people getting angry
This town is coming like a ghost town (5x)
