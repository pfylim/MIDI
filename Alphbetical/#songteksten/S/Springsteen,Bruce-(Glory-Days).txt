I had a friend was a big baseball player
back in high school
he could throw that speedball by you
make you look like a fool boy
saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in and he was walking out
we went back inside sat down, had a few drinks
but all he kept talking about was
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory Days, glory days.

There's a girl that lives up the block back
in school she could turn all the boys' heads
sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by and 
have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed.

Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I gues it's two years gone by now
we just sit around talking about the old times,
she says when she feels like crying
she starts laughing thinking about
Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory Days, glory days.

Think I'm going down to the well tonight
and I'm going to drink till I get my fill
and I hope when I get old I don't sit
around thinking about it but I probably will
yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
a little of the glory of, but time slips away
and leaves you with nothing mister but
boring stories of glory days.

Glory days well they'll pass you by
Glory days in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory Days, glory days.
