Well, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa men have named you,
you're so like the lady with the mystic smile,
is it only cause you're lonely they have blamed you,
for that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile ?

Well, is your smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa,
or  is this your way to hide a broken heart ?
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
they just lie there, and they die there.

Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa,
or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
In a villa, in a little old Italian town
lives a girl whose beauty shames the rose.
Many yearn to love her but their hopes all tumble down.

What does she want ? I guess nobody knows.
Is your smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa,
or  is this your way to hide a broken heart ?
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa,
or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.
