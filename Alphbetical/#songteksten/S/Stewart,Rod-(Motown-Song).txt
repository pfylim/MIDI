        Motownsong             Rod Steward


There's a soul, in the city, watching over us tonight
There's a soul, in the city, there's a whole world
waiting out there, oh yeah

Do, do, do, do, do...

Bring over some of your old motown rabits
we put this beat cause in the window and the cold
On the roof they listen to the miracles echoe
to the alley down below

Let's dance together just for the nigth
Let's not worry about the future or nothing else
Cause just like the music song we got to take chances
Go here just doing it and trust yourself
There's a soul in the city watching over us tonigth
There's a soul in the city saying everything's gonna 
be allrigth

They wish us luck but they think we're just dreaming
That's proof I'm wrong babe cause you Know what luck is
Luck is believing you what luck is that's all
And showing just a little bit of faith
There's a soul in the city wathing over us I sweare
There's a soul in the city there's a whole world
waiting out there, oh year

Do, do, do, do, do...

Listen I got plans for us, they're like a skip of
miracles all nigth long
But when we walk that do, and still wait and step
out of the roof
I know what we're feeling shan't be wrong, oh year
