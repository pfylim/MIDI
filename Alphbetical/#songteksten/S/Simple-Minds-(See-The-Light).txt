Summer's gone
Winter's in your eyes
I can feel the thunder storms inside
I wake up every morning
And the cold winds cover me
All I've
Got's a ghost
Of what could be
If you can see the lights
Shine in front of me
If you can see the lights
Shout out where you'll be
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm in a broken dream
I stare out into space
You know I called you up 
Cos nothing takes your place
I've got a heart of stone
And it's sinking deep inside
I want to tell you love
I'm too proud to cry
--------------------------------------------------------
If you can see the lights
Shine in front of me
If you can see the lights
Shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone
And I can't tell you lies
Oh forgive me love
I'm too proud to cry
If you could see the lights
Shine in front of me
If you can see the lights
Shout out where you'll be
Summer's gone
And I can't tell you lies
Forgive me love
I'm too proud to cry
Too proud to cry
Too proud to cry
Too proud to cry
