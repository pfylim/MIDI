I remember that first night we met
Dancing to the sounds of clarinet
Dancing cheek to cheek
Oh how sweet
You and me and the fantasy
Oh I remember our first night.

I remember how we carried on
Arm in arm until the light of dawn
From the very start
Stole my heart
Knew right there that we'd never part
Oh, I remember that first night.

Remember that first night
(4X)

I saw your love life through the candles glow
Champagne was flowing
And so I let myself go
And when the night was over
The people looked around the room
Remember darling
Chairs on the table
And only me and you.

I remember how we carried on
Arm in arm until the light of dawn
From the very start
Stole my heart
Knew right there that we'd never part
Oh, I remember that first night.

Remember that first night
(4X)
