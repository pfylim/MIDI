                 Wind Of Change                   Scorpions


I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park,
Listening to the wind of change. An August summer night, soliders passing by,
Listening to the wind of change.
Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory nihgt,
Where the children of tomorrow dream away in the wind of change.
The world is closing in. 
Did you ever think that we could be so close, like brothers ?
The future's in the air, I can feel it everywhere, blowing with the wind of change.

Refrain 

Take me to the magic of the moment on a glory night,
Where the children of tomorrow share their in the wind of change.

Walking down the street,Distant memories are buried in the past forever.
I follow the Moskva down to Gorky Park, Listening to the wind of change.

The wind of change blows straight in the face of time,
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell for peace of mind.
Let your balalaika sing what my guitar wants to say.
