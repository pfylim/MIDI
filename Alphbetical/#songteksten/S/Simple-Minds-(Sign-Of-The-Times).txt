In France a skinny man died of
a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend across a
needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen year old
boys and their idea of fun
Is being a gang  called the "Disciples"
high on crack and
toting machine gun
Time - Time -
--------------------------------------------------------
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a
church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and
every other story is telling you
somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cause
she couldn't afford tofeed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried
reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse it's June
Times - Times -
--------------------------------------------------------
When a rocket ship explodes and
everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't
happy unless a man truly dies
Oh why? Time - Time -
Baby make a speech star wars fly neigh-
bors just shine it on
But if a night falls and the bomb falls
will anybody see the dawn?
Time - Time -
--------------------------------------------------------
It's silly no when a rocket
blows and everybody
still wants to fly
Some say man ain't
happy truly 'til man truly dies
Oh why? Oh why?
Sign o'the times!Time - Time -
--------------------------------------------------------
Sign o'the times
mess with your mind+
hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love got married
have a baby we'll call him Nate
if it's a boy Time - Time
