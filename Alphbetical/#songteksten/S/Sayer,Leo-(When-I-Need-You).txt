Title  : WHEN I NEED YOU

(Words & music: Carol Bayer Sager/Albert Hammond)

Refrain:
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I saw wanna give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day

A thousand miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do

Refrain: ...

It's not easy when the road is goodbye love
Honey that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a life time
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do

Refrain: ...

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day
