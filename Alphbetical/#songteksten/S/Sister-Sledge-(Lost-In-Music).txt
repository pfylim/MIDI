Singer : SISTER SLEDGE
Title  : LOST IN MUSIC

(Words & music: Bernard Edwards/Nile Rodgers)

Chorus:
We're lost in music, caught in a trap
No turning back, we're lost in music
We're lost in music, feel so alive
I quit my nine to five, we're lost in music

Have you ever seen some people lose ev'rything
First to go is their mind
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time

I want to join a band
And play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me a melody
That's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

Chorus: ...

In the spotlight, the band plays so very tight
Each and every night
It's not vanity, to me it's my sanity
I could never survive

Some people ask me
What are you gonna be?
Why don't you get a job?
All that I can say
I won't give up my music
Not me, not now, noway, no how!

Chorus: ...
