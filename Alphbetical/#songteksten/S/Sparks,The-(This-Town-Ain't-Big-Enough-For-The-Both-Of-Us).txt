Singer : SPARKS 
Title  : THIS TOWN AIN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE BOTH OF US

Zoo time is she and you time
The mammals are your fav'rite type
You'd better want her tonight
Heart beat increasing heart beat
You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos
Elephants and tacky tigers
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me who's gonna leave

Flying domestic flying
And when the stewardess is near
Do not show any fear
Heart beat increasing heart beat
You are a khaki colored bombardier
It's Hiroshima that you're nearing
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me who's gonna leave

Daily except for Sunday you dawdle
Into the cafe where you meet her each day
Heart beat increasing heart beat as
Twenty cannibals have hold of you
They need their protein just like you do
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me who's gonna leave

Shower another shower you've got to look
Your best for her and be clean ev'rywhere
Heart beat increasing heart beat
The rain is pouring on the foreign town
The bullets can not cut you down
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
And it ain't me who's gonna leave

Census the latest census, there'll be more
Girls who live in town though not enough to go round
Heart beat increasing heart beat you know that
This town ain't big enough, not big enough
for the both of us
This town ain't big enough for the both of us
I ain't gonna leave
