SADE - LOVE IS STRONGER THAN PRIDE

(Words & music: Adu/Hale/Matthewman)

I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
But I can't hate you
Although I have tried I

Refrain:
I still really, really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really, really love you, mmm

I won't pretend that I intend to stop living
I won't pretend I'm good at forgiving
But I can't hate you
Although I have tried ooh I

Refrain: ...

Sitting here wasting my time
Would be like
Waiting for the sun to rise
It's all too clear yeah things come and go
Sitting here waiting for you
It's gonna be like waiting for winter
It's gonna be cold
There may even be snow

I still really, really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really, really love you
Love is stronger
I still really love you
Love is stronger than pride yeah
