Why do lovers break each others hearts?
Oh tell me why do lovers have to drift apart?
When we met my world was bright
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others hearts?

Why do lovers break each others hearts?
Oh tell me why can't lovers finish what they start?
A year ago we were one
Now just look at what you've done
Why do lovers break each others hearts?

Help me, help me, I don't understand
Why we always hurt the one we love?
Tell me, tell me, where's the life we planned
Where are the dreams that we were dreamin' of?

Why do lovers break each others hearts?
Oh tell me why do lovers have to drift apart
When we met my world was bright
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others hearts?

When we met my world was bright
Now I'm crying every night
Why do lovers break each others hearts?
