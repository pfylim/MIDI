Well I'm holding you baby
I want to hold you oh so tight,
I want to love you baby,
ooh all through the night,
don't turn your back on my advice,
oooh when I'm tryin' to be so nice.

We'll get on down and I know you'll come around,
you've got me reelin' and a rockin',
oooh baby I'm a hound,
don't turn your back on my advice,
oooh baby when I'm tryin' to be so nice.

You've got me crawling like a reptile,
you want to grab my tail.
Well, hold on pretty baby,
and you'll make me wail,
it took a little time,
oooh baby, ooh that's fine.
Now you're feelin' good,
oooh like I knew you should.
Well you took my advice,
oooh baby ooh that's nice.
