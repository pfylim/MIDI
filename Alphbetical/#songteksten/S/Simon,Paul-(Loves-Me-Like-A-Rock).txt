When I was a little boy
and the devil would call my name
I'd say "now who do,
who do you think you're fooling ?"
I'm a consecrated boy
singer in my Sunday choir
my mama loves, she loves me
she gets down on her knees and hug me
she loves me like a rock
she rocks me like the rock of ages
and she loves me.

When I was grown to be a man
and the devil would call my name
I'd say "now who do,
who do you think you're fooling ?"
I'm a consummated man
I can snatch a little purity
my mama loves, she loves me
she gets down on her knees and hug me
she loves me like a rock
she rocks me like the rock of ages
and she loves me.

If I was President
and the Congress call my name
I'd say "now who do,
who do you think you're fooling ?"
I've got the Presidential seal
I'm up on the Presidential Podium
my mama loves, she loves me
she gets down on her knees and hug me
she loves me like a rock
she rocks me like the rock of ages
and she loves me
she loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me.
 more time
(Oh no)
see I already left you
and you're better off left behind
(Oh no, oh no)
