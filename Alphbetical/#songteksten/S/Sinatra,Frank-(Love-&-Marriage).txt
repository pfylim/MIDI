Title  : Love And Marriage
Singer : Frank Sinatra


Love and marriage (2x)
Got together like a horse and carriage
This I tell ya brother
You can't have one without the other

Love and marriage (2x)
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry and they will say
It's elementr'y

Try, try try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try try and you will only come to this conclusion :

Love and marriage (2x)
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one
You can't have none
You can't have one without the other!


Words & Music : Sammy Cahn, James van Heusen
