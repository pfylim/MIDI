SPARGO - LADY

Oh yeah
Lady, what you're tryin' to tell me
No nothing has changed
I just rearranged my life
So baby, I think you'd better go now
'Cause I don't need you, I don't want
you anymore babe
Now what you're waitin' for babe
Just stop talkin'
You'd better start right on walkin'
away from me
I wanna be free
Oh, I don't need you, I don't want you

Refrain:
Lady we can't put it right
You can't take me home tonight
Lady I don't wanna fight
So lady get out of my sight (sight, sight, sight)

Lady, you're actin' kinda shady
You're always fakin' I can't take it
anymore now
I'll show you to the door now
Mmm, what you're tryin' to say
Do you really wanna stay with me today
No way 'cause I don't need you, I don't
want you

Refrain: ...

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (I don't need you)
Oh oh I don't want you oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh lady we can't
put it right
You can't take me home tonight
Lady I don't wanna fight
So lady get out of my sight (sight, sight, sight)
