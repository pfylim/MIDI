          Maniac            Michael Sembello 


Just a small town girl on a Saturday night,
Looking for the fight of her life ;
In the real time world noone sees her at all,
They all say she's crazy.
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart ,
Changing movement into light ,
She has danced into the dangerzone
When the dancer becomes the dance.

It can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be .

Refrain 

She's a maniac , maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before.
She's a maniac , maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before.


On the ice blue line of insanity is a place most never see ;
It's a hard won place of mystery , touch it , but can't hold it.
You work all your life for that moment in time ,
It can come or pass you by.
It's a push , shove world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night.
There's a cold kinetic heat struggling , stretching for the peak ,
Never stopping with her head against the wind.

Refrain 

She's a maniac , maniac on the floor ...

It can cut like a knife if the gift becomes the fire ...

She's a maniac , maniac on the floor ...
She's a maniac , maniac on the floor ...
