Title  : YOU DON'T KNOW ME

(Words & music: Dave Jordan)

You say you know me
You really know me
You say you need me
But do you need me

But you don't know me at all
You wonder how did you fall

Thinking that I just don't care
Any minute I'm not there
Sitting all alone
Picking up the phone to call
Swear it can't be true
That I could care the way I do

Then you don't know me at all
Shooby doo down down
I'm not fooling round
It's nothing now in telling
You this heart of mine beats
Just for you

Shooby doo down dum
You're the only one

There is no reason I should ever lie
Wo-oh wo-oh
