If blood will flow
when flesh and steel are one,
drying in the color of the evening sun.
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away,
but something in our minds will always stay.

Perhaps this final act 
was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument
that nothing comes from violence,
and nothing ever could.
For all those born beneath an angry star,
lest we forget how fragile we are.
On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star.
On and on the rain will say how fragile we are,
how fragile we are.
