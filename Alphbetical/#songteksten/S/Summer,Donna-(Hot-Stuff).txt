Sitting here eating my heart out waiting
waiting for some lovers call
dialed about a thousand numbers lately
almost rang the phone off the wall.

Looking for some hot stuff, baby, this evening
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evening.
Gotta have some hot stuff, gotta have some love tonight.

Hot stuff, I need hot stuff,
I want some hot stuff,
I need hot stuff.

Looking for a lover who needs another
don't wanna another night on my own
wanna share my love with a warm-blooded lover
wanna bring a wild man back home.

Gotta have some hot stuff, baby, this evening,...

Hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot, hot stuff
hot, hot, hot.
