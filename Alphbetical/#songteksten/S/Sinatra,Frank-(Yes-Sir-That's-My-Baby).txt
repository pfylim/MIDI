       Yes Sir that's my baby


Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now
Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Yes ma'am, we've decided
No ma'am, we won't hide it
Yes ma'am, you're invited now
By the way, by the way,
When we reach the preacher I'll say
Yes, sir that's my baby,
No, sir don't mean "maybe",
Yes, sir, that's my baby now

Who's that comming down the street?
Who's that looking so petire?
Who's that comming down to meet me here
Who's that you lenow who I mean,
Sweetest "who" you're ever seen,
I could tell her miles away from here

Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now
Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now

Well, well "look it" that baby
Do tell, don't say "maybe"
Nell's bells won't she cause some row
Pretty soon, pretty soon,
We will hear that Lohengrin tune
Who for should she be sir, 
No one else but me sir,
Yes, sir, that's my baby now

Who's the who I rave about?
Who do I feel blue without,
In the winter, summer, spring and fall
Who was I just "gonna" say,
I forget, but any way,
Her's the most important thing of all

Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now
Yes sir, that's my baby,
No sir, don't mean "Maybe"
Yes sir, that's my baby now
