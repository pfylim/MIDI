It's too late
There's no time for a tango
You have to go home
Not even time for some love oh
My husband will come
Besides I have a lumbago
From dancing too long
And I have to do the mambo
With my man

There's no time for a tango
My man he is there
He's peeping right through the window
You better take care
He jumps around like a jojo
Now run if you can
Now it's time to do a tango
With my man

Chorus:
So hard to give you all my love
(Shame on you, shame on you)
'Cause my man is takin' all I've got
(It's not true, it's not true)
Don't wanna be wicked, you dig it
Don't wanna trick him
But tango I can give enough

It's too late
There's no time for a tango
You have to go home
Not even time for some love oh
My husband will come
Besides I have a lumbago
From dancing too long
And I have to do the mambo
With my man

Chorus: ...
