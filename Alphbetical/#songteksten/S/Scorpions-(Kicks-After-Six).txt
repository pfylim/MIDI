Another morning, such as ordinary day
she's doin' time from nine to five
the hours waste away
there's no escape, she's a part of the big machine
she's a slave to the suit and tie
seven days a week.

But every night
she can hardly wait
it feels alright
to give it all away.

Good girls get their kicks after six
good girls get their kicks after six
(she needs it bad, real real bad)
she wants what she never had
all the things that make a good girl bad
she gets her kicks after six.

Some days it's hard to face the cruel reality
just waitin' for the bell to ring
she wants to be free
it feels so good to start another endless night
she spreads her wings for another flight
she's running wild.

And every night
she can hardly wait
it feels alright
to give it all away.

Good girls get their kicks after six
(she needs it bad, real real bad)
good girls get their kicks after six
(oooh yeah shake it for me baby)
she wants what she never had
all the things that make a good girl bad
she gets her kicks after six.

Good girls get their kicks after six
(she needs it bad, real real bad)
good girls get their kicks after six
(oooh yeah nothin's gonna stop her)
she wants what she never had
all the things that make a good girl bad
she gets her kicks after six.

Good girls get their kicks after six
(she needs it bad, real real bad)
good girls get their kicks after six
(c'mon baby take it to the limit)
she wants what she never had
all the things that make a good girl bad
she gets her kicks after six.
