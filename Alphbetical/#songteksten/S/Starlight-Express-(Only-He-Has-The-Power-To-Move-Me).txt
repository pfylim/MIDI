  10. Only He Has The Power To Move Me - Starlight Express
  
  Look at me a woman
  Calm and in control
  No silly girl whose head's always turning
  Nobody would guess that
  Deep inside my soul
  A brand new flame is burning
  
  Only he has the power to move me
  And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
  But i couldn't see before
  That only he has the power to move me
  Take me hold me mould me change me and improve me
  It's not funny anymore
  Only he can be my burning light
  Only he can make the wrongs be right
  Only he can make the shadows bright and make the darkness clear and white
  He him and me
  Only he has the power to move me
  
  All the life I've wasted
  Dreaming all the time
  Well I've discovered the one to guide me
  Searching the horizon didn't realise
  That all the time he was beside me
  
  Only he has the power to move me
  And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
  Hope and pray that I'm in time
  Only he can stand and wait that longer
  Stand by me if I was going wrong
  What if he couldn't wait
  Have I left it too late
  
  Only he has the power to move me
  And together we'd make the whole world move in sympathy
  Him and me we'd be sublime
  And he still would never guess
  That next time I'm gonna answer yes
  Does he know if he comes back today
  This time I'm gonna make him stay
  He, only he, only he has the power
  Every day every hour he moves me.
