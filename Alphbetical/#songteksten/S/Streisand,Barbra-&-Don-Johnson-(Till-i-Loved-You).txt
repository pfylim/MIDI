BARBRA STEISAND & DON JOHNSON - TILL I LOVED YOU

(Words & music: M. Yeston)

Don: Nothing lived nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever grey
Never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And sometimes I would wonder
Could the one to save me
Possibly be you

Barbra: I was lost I was blind
Till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new
You were my friend, dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never thought I'd feel the way I do

Both: Until that certain moment
When I loved you

Don: And now I can't ever imagine
My living without you

Barbra: It seems I spend all my time
Thinking only about you

Both: Once I dreamed, in a dream
I would find you
Never thought that the dream
Would come true
Until that curtain lifted
Parted drifted from you
Until that certain moment
When I loved you
Until that certain moment
Certain moment
When I loved you
When I loved you

Both: Nothing lived nothing grew
Till I loved you
Every sky ever grey
Never blue

Don: You came along stole my heart completely

Barbra: And I thought could the one
To save me possibly be you

Don: Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Barbra: Ha ha ha ha 
