SIMPLE MINDS - ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID

Don't you look back on a big lost world
(Crying out tomorrow)
Don't you look down like the heroes say
(Tell me all about it)
Take me to the streets where the bonfires burn
Take me in your arms and I'll fade away
When I hear you say what you got to say

Anywhere you go
You know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said she said
Little darling close your eyes
There'll be no compromising
Of all the things she said she said

Throw me to the streets
Where the heartbeat's beating
(It's beating all around me)
To the peaceful revolution
And the perfect wave surround me
Tell me 'bout the ocean moving in slow motion
I see it glitter in the sun
Then it's freezing in the moonlight
Never look back
Never look back
Never look away

If freedom comes and goes
You know I'll still be waiting
All the things she said she said
You've fought the fight so long
No surrender to temptation
All the things she said she said

Stars will fall out for you
Luck will surrender
I'm calling out to you
(Oh to be near you in the first morning light)
I'd be with you I dream about you
(If I could leave here I would leave here tonight)
I'd be with you I'd stay with you tonight

Anywhere you go know I'll still be waiting
Of all the things she said she said

When I look into your eyes
I see a new day rising
Of all the things she said she said
Through the eyes of love
And to never know what hate is
Of all the things she said she said
She said this in our time
She said this in our place
This is the space my heart wants to be
Little darling close your eyes
There'll be no compromising
All the things she said she said
