REBELL YELL - SCOOTER


In the midnight hour

Last night a little dancer
Came dancing to my door.
Last night my little angel
Came stomping on the floor.
She said: Oh come on baby.
I got a licence for love.
And if it expires 
Pray help from above because

Chorus
In the midnight hour 
She cried more, more, more.
With a rebell yell
She cried more, more, more.
In the midnight hour babe
More, more, more.
With a rebell yell
More, more, more.
More, more, more.

She dealt like slavery.
She won`t sit and beg.
But when I taught her lonely
She sees me to bed.
What set you free
It brought you to me babe.
What set you free
I need to hear from me because

Chorus

I walked a wall with you babe.
Eight thousand miles with you.
I dried your tears of pain.
Eight million times for you.
I`d sell my soul for you babe.
For money to burn for you.
I`d give you all and have none babe.
Just to just to just to just to
To have you here by me because

Chorus

More, more, more, more, more
