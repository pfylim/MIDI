Title  : Skin Deep
Singer : The Stranglers


Many people tell you
That they're your friend
You believe them, you need them
For what's round the river bend
Make sure that you're receiving
The signals they send
Cause brother, you've only
Got two hands to lend

Chorus:
Oo, better watch out for the skin deep (2x)
Better watch our, watch out for the skin deep (2x)
Better watch out for the skin deep

Maybe there's someone
Who makes you weep
And some bights loom up ahead
When you're asleep
Some days there's things
On your mind you should keep
Sometimes it's tougher
To look than to leap

Chorus

One day the track
That you're climbing gets steep
Your emotions are frayed
And your nerves are starting to creep
Just remember the days
As long as the times that you keep
Brother, you better watch out
For the skin deep

Chorus
