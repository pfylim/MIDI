We got to say ,that we remember you
sorry that her's day there gone you , came out of the blue

Take good care of my baby , we don't ever make her blue
just tell her that you love her , make's you your thinking of her 
and everything you saying true

I saw her today , I saw her face , it was a face I love and I knew
I had to run away , and get down on my knees and pray
that they go away,and still they begin , needles and pins
because of all my pride , the tears I gonna hide
what still they begin , needles and pins

Oh love is a life and so it begins
foolishly laying the hearts on the table , stumblin in
oh love is a flame and burning within
now and then , far life will catch us , stumblin in
wherever you go , whatever you do
you know this reckless father of mad , following you

So she cry just a little for a few dollars more
she lie just a little like she's gonna before
she'll take it she 'll break it for a few dollars more
she'll show you her heart , and she'll show you the door
you kow she'll die just a little for a few dollars more
even fly just a little like she's gonna before
she'll take it she'll break it for a few dollars more
she'll show you her heart and she'll show you the door 

If you want my sympathy , just open your heart to me
you're given whatever you need
you think that's too high for you
oh baby , I would die for you
and there's nothing left you know where I'll be
lay back in the arms of someone give in to the charms of someone
lay back in the arms of someone you love
lay back in the arms of someone
when you think you're apart of someone
lay back in the arms of someone you love .

So if you think you know how to love me
and if you think you know what I mean
and if you really , really you want me to stay
you got to leave the way

Sally called and she got the word 
she said I supposed I heared ... about Alice
well I rushed to the window and I looked outside
and I could hardly believe my eyes
and the big limousine went off , into Alice's drive
Oh , I don't know where she's leaving the way she's gonna go
I guess she's got a reason but I just don't want to know
'cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice
twenty-four years just waiting for a chance
to tell her how I'm feeling maybe get a second glance
now I got to get used in not living next door to Alice

Mexican girl don't leave me alone
I got a heart as big as a stone
and I need you , believe me , to hear her and love me tonight
Mexican girl I want you to say
you know my heart is longing to say
as a long as I live I will always remember the one that I called
my Mexican girl

As you were soft as the growing sky
and her hair was shine in the moonlight
I was smoking the grey when the night turn to day
and I hold her tight
and she looked at me with her dark brown eyes
and she whispered 'Hasta la vista'
I don't know what that means but it's sound was so good
so I kissed her

Mexican girl .....
