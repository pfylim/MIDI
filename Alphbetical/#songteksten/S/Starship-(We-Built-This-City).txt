STARSHIP - WE BUILT THIS CITY

We built this city
We built this city on rock'n'roll

Say you don't know me
Well recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes
To that kind of place
Knee deep in the hoop-la
Sinking in my fight
Too many runaways
Eating up the night

REFRAIN:
Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio
Don't you remember
We built this city
We built this city on rock'n'roll

Someone's always playing
Corporation games
Who cares they're always changing
Corporation names
We just want to dance here
But someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible
And write us off the page

REFRAIN: ...

Bridge:
And it's another sunday
In a tired old street
The police have got the choke hold
And we just lost the beat

Who counts the money
Underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into your guitars
Don't tell us you need us
We're the ship of fools
Looking for America
Crawling through your schools

REFRAIN: ...
