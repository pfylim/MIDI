
SCATMAN'S WORLD - JOHN SCATMAN

I'm callin' out from Scatland
I'm callin' out from Scatman's world
If you wanna break free you better listen to me
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy.

I'm callin' out from Scatland....

Everybody's talkin' something very shocking
Just to keep on blockin' what they're feeling inside
But listen to me brother, you just keep on walkin'
'cause you and me and sister ain't got nothing to hide

Scatman, fat man, black and white and brown man
Tell me 'bout the colour of your soul
If part of your solution isn't ending the pollution
Then I don't want to hear your stories told.
I want to welcome you to Scatman's world.

I'm callin' out from Scatland
I'm callin' out from Scatman's world
If you wanna break free you better listen to me
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy.

Everyone's born to compete as he chooses
But how can someone win if winning means that someone loses.
I seat and see and wonder what it's like to be in touch
No wonder all my brothers and my sisters need a crutch

I want to be a human being, not a human not a human doing
I couldn't keep the pace up if I tried.
The source of my intention really isn't crime prevention.
My intention is prevention of the lie
Welcome to the Scatman's world

I'm callin' out from Scatland
I'm callin' out from Scatman's world
If you wanna break free you better listen to me
You got to learn how to see in your fantasy.
