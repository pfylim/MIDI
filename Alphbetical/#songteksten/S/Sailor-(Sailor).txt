Singer : SAILOR 
Title  : SAILOR

Sailor get your feet on the ground
Get your leave get your money
Get your ass into town
(Lonely town needs you around)
Sailor won't you stay for a while
There's a town full of girl
That could do with a smile
(Lonely girls brush up your curls)

Get in the game pick out the dame
(dum dedum dedum)
This is the place where you set the pace
(dum dedum dedum)
The streets are lit with the good
times rolling
The bars are filled with the good
stud floating
Set me up Joe let the booze flow

Give out the juice she won't refuse
(dum dedum dedum)
This is your chance for love and romance
(dum dedum dedum)
Your leave is short but the action's growing
Get in the sheets before you start slowing
Down down down

Hey sailor is there anything wrong
There's a dame in your lap but you
don't get it on
(She's o.k. so why don't you play)
Sailor is it true what they say
That you mess with the boys
When the girls are away
(Bad bad boy wrong kind of toy)

Do what they said, get into the bed
(dum dedum dedum)
Don't be afraid she knows her trade
(dum dedum dedum)
You've got to live up to all those stories
Sailor boy with your sexed up glories
Set me up Joe let the booze flow
Pull up your socks pull out the stops
(dum dedum dedum)
Do what you can she'll understand
(dum dedum dedum)
It's hard to make up for all that sailing
Out on the sea you lose all your training
Let the booze flow, let yourself go
