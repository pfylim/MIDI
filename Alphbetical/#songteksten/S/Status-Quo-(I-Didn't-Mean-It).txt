4. I DIDN'T MEAN IT - STATUS QUO

One-two-three-four
When you say those words those three little words
You're in at the deep end
Give up the night times, give up the high times,
Give up the weekends
Give up the chance to be your own man
Let the feeling take over
The only way out is to lie if you can
But you don't have the knack
And you'll come crawling back

Say: I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said
I didn't mean it

I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said
It was only a game

I didn't mean, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words
I didn't mean it

I felt tied down
My pride's down
That I put that lie down
The price now for you is me

Well I was like you
And all I could do
Was give up and surrender
The people could drink what they did at my place
But that is pretenders
They told me listen be acting today
'Cause a lie is sinful and impure
But funny if you found you made a mistake
The medicine's worse than the cure
And you'll be back for sure

Say: I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said
I didn't mean it

I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said
It was only a game

I didn't mean, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words
I didn't mean it

I felt tied down
My pride's down
That I put that lie down
The price now for you is me

Give up the chance to be your own man
Let the feeling take over
The only way out is to lie if you can
But you don't have the knack
And you'll come crawling back

Say: I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said when I said
I didn't mean it

I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to say what I said
It was only a game

I didn't mean, I didn't mean it
I didn't mean to tell you in so many words
I didn't mean it

I felt tied down
My pride's down
That I put that lie down
The price now for you is me
