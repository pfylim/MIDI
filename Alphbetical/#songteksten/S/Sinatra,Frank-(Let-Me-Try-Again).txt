Singer : FRANK SINATRA 
Title  : LET ME TRY AGAIN

I know I said that I was leaving
But I just couldn't say goodbye
It was only self deceiving to walk away
From someone who means everything in life to you
You lean from every lonely day and I've come back to stay

I was such a fool to doubt you to try to go
it all alone
There's no sense to life without you now
All I do is just exist and think about
the change I've missed
To fake is not an easy task
But pride is such a foolish mask

Let me try again let me try again
Think of all we had before
Let me try once more
We can have it all
You and I again
Just forgive me or I'll die
Let me try again
