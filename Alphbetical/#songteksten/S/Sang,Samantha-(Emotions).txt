Title  : EMOTIONS

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

It's over and done
But the heartache lives on inside
Ah, and who is the one you're clinging to
Instead of me tonight

Chorus:
And where are you now
Now that I need you
Tears on my pillow
Wherever you go
I cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion, that's taking me over
Tied up in sorrow, lost in my soul
And if you don't come back, come home to me darling
You know that there'll be nobody else in this world
To hold me tight, nobody left in this world
To kiss goodnight, goodbye, goodbye

I'm there at your side
I'm part of all the things you are
Ah but you got a part of someone else
You got to find your shining star

Chorus: ...
