
12. BACK IN THE UK - SCOOTER

This is the journey 
Into the past, the present and the future
Now close your eyes and join the trip
It`s six a.m. in the morning
And we find ourselves somewhere in England

Welcome for say

We`re kicking up

Once again we have the plan
Driving you all as good as we can
Don`t stop us now 
We gonna make you move
Raving outside to the passionate groove

I want it shut the microphone
I want it shut the microphone     
I want it shut 
I want it shut 

The rave, the first
The M C H B Scooter
Back in the UK

Yes call

Somewhere in England
Back in the base
Join our trip to this weird place
Back to nature where we can be
Pass and harder, loud and free

I want it shut the microphone
I want it shut the microphone     
I want it shut 
I want it shut 

The rave, the first
The M C H B Scooter
Back in the UK

Please yes call

We started in 1994
In 1996 we`re still on the case
Hold joined grow
Together no one can stop us now

Never stop the hard core

So I want it shut the microphone
I want it shut the microphone     
I want it shut 
I want it shut 

The birds, the trees
The cows, the seas
The rick, the flowers
And M C H B

Hold joined par se
