Mademoiselle Ninette  -  The Soulful Dynamics


In my last holiday, I took a trip to the USA,
Well, I did fine, I had a very good time.
Guess what happened to me, I met a girl
And one, two, three, we fell in love,
We got the heaven above.

Mademoiselle Ninette !
No, no, I've never had a girl like you !

We spent every day, it was so nice
That even today, I see Ninette,
Can't get her out of my head.
In my next holiday I'll take a trip to the USA,
And I'll be fine, I'll have a good time.

Mademoiselle Ninette !
No, no, I've never had a girl like you !
