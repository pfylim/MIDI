
12. STILL LOVING YOU - Scorpions

Time in its time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there.

Love only love
Can bring back your love some day
I will be there
I will be there.

Fight baby fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there.

Love only love
Can bring down that love some day
I will be there
I will be there.

Here we go again
On the way from the start
I would try to change 
Things that killed our love
Pride has built them all
So strong that they can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again?
I'm loving you.

Try baby try
To trust in my love again
I will be there
I will be there.

Stop our love
Just change every family
I will be there
I will be there.

Here we go again
On the way from the start
I would try to change 
Things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride
In an hour what you could do
You should give me a chance 
Please give me the end
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
A real love
I'm still loving you
Still loving you, baby.
