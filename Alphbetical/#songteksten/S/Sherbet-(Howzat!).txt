Title  : HOWZAT!

(Words & music: Garth Porter/Tony Mitchell)

You told me I was the one
The only one who got your head undone
And for a while I believed the line that you spun

But I've been looking at you
Looking closely at the things you do
I didn't see you the way you wanted me to

How, how, howzat?
You messed about, I caught you out, howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's goodbye, well, howzat?
It's goodbye

You only came for a smile
Even though you're really not my style
I didn't think that you'd run me round like you do

How, how, howzat?
You messed about, I caught you out, howzat?
Now that I've found where you're at
It's goodbye, well, howzat?
It's goodbye
