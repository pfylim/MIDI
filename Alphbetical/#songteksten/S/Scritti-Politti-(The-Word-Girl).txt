SCRITTI POLITTI - THE WORD GIRL

To do what I should do
To long for you to hear
I open up my heart
And watch her name appear

A word for you to use
A girl without a cause
A name for what you lose
When it was never yours

Refrain:
Oh do do do do
The first time baby that I came to you
I'd do things that you want me to
The second time baby that I came to you
Oh you found my love for you

The third time baby that I came to you
Oh oh oh I knew
The last time baby that I came to you
Oh how your flesh and blood
Became the word

A name the girl outgrew
The girl was never real
She stands for your abuse
The girl is no ideal

It's a word for what you do
In a world of broken rules
She found a place for you
Along her chain of fools

Refrain: ...

Oh how your flesh and blood
