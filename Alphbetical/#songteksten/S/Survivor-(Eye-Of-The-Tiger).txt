                             EYE OF THE TIGER

     As performed by: Survivor     1982 Scotti Brothers Records 


     Risin' up,..back on the stree-eet,...
     Took my time, took my cha-ances...
     Went the distance now I'm back on my-y feet, 
     just a man..and his will to survi--ve...

     So many times,..it happens too fa-ast,.. 
     you trade your passion for glo-ory...
     Don't lose your grip..on the dreams of the-e past..
     You must fight..just to keep..them ali--ve.

     It's the..eye of the tiger, it's the cream of the fight,
     risin' up..to the challenge of our ri-ival..
     And alas no survivors 'cause he's there in the night 
     and he's watchin' us all with the eye----- of the ti-iger--...

     Face to face, out in the hea-eat,.. 
     panicked up, stained and hu-ungry...
     Lays back the odds..'til we take to the street,
     for the kill..with the skill to survi---ve.

     It's the..eye of the tiger it's the cream o' the fight,
     risin' up to the challenge of our ri-ival.
     And alas, no survivors 'cause he's there in the night 
     and he's watchin' us all with the eye--- of the ti-iger---...

     BRIDGE....................

     Risin' up, straight to the to-op,.. 
     had the guts got the glo-ory...
     went the distance now I'm not gonna stop, 
     just a man..and his will to survi---ve..

     It's the..eye of the tiger it's the cream of the fight,
     rising up to the challenge of our ri-ival
     And alas, no survivors 'cause he's there in the night 
     and he's watchin' us all with the eye----- of the ti-iger---...

     The eye of the tiger.......
     The eye of the tiger........
     The eye of the tiger.........
