9. SOMETHIN' STUPID - NANCY & FRANK SINATRA

I know I stand in line until you think
You have the time to spend the evening with me
And if we go some place to dance I know
That there's a chance you won't be leaving with me
Then Afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saving something stupid
Like I love You
I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lies
You heard the night before 
And though it's just  lying to you
For me it's true and never seems so right before
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to
make the meaning come true
but when I think I'll wait until the evening it's late
And I'm alone with you
The time is right your perfume thrills my hair
The stars get bright and all the night so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saving something stupid
Like I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
