Singer : SHEILA & THE BLACK DEVOTION 
Title  : LOVE ME BABY

(Words & music: M. Wickfield/P. Racer)

Love me baby with emotion
Baby love me with devotion
I see tenderness in your eyes
It's a feeling that you can't disguise
Love me baby, baby love me
In the starlight, in the moonlight
Love me like a flower loves the sun
Love me every moment from now on

Only yesterday I was lonely in a bar
Playing Spanish music on my Spanish guitar
Then you walked in girl
Looking like a movie star
Now that we're together
Please don't love me from afar

Love me baby with affection
Baby love me to perfection
Love me like a breeze loves to play
Blowing through the leaves a summer day
Love me baby, baby love me
Love me truly, love me dearly
Love me like green grass loves the rain
Love me like a night fly loves the flame

Lucky, lucky me found a honey girl like you
All I do is love you turn into honey dew
Sunlight in your eyes 
Don't you feel the same way too
Now that we're together
Please don't love me from afar

Love me baby with emotion
Baby love me with devotion
I see tenderness in your eyes
It's a feeling that you can't disguise
Love me baby, baby love me
Love me even when I'm crazy
Love me when I sing and when I dance
Love me like young lovers, love in France
Sweetly, love sweetly
Gently, love me gently
Only, love me only

Now that we're together
You love me and I'll love you
Love me gladly, love me madly
Don't you tease me, come on squeeze me
Love me all the day and all the night
Love me like a man should love his wife

Love me baby with emotion
Baby love me with devotion
Love me all the day and all the night
Love me like a man should love his wife

Love me baby with affection
Baby love me to perfection
Love me all the day and all the night
Love me like a man should love his wife
