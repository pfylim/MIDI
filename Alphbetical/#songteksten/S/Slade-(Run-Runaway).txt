  Singer  : SLADE 
  Title   : Run Runaway
  Written : By Noddy Holder/Jim Lea

  I like black and white
  Dreaming in black and white
  You like black and white
  Run Runaway

  See chameleon
  Lying there in the sun
  All things to everyone
  Run Runaway

  If you're in the swing
  Money ain't everything
  If your're in the swing
  Run Runaway

  See chameleon
  Lying there in the sun
  All things to everyone
  Run Runaway

  If you gotta crush
  Don't beat about the bush
  When I gotta crush
  Run Runaway

  See chameleon
  Lying there in the sun
  All things to everyone
  Run Runaway

  Oh now can't you wait
  Love don't come on a plate
  Oh now can't you wait
  Run Runaway

  See chameleon
  Lying there in the sun
  All things to everyone
  Run Runaway

  Run Runaway
  Run Runaway
  Run Runaway
