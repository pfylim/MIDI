We rode all night across an endless desert
We had no moon to light our way
And though a million stars were slowly turning
We're like the conscious of those who prey
Our horses were running like a devil tizzers
Those feet they hardly touched the ground
You sound familiar with the grey wolves howled
But I'm certain I've never heard this sound.

The ones who pay on judgement day
Will Jesus strike me down
If I should pray
This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
The distant sun
You, shining light
You'll be my dark sunshine
Tonight.

I've been a rolling stop low on the planet
I've been a sinner all my days
When I was living with my hand on the trigger
I had no sense to change my ways
The priest had asked if
I would embrace the resurrection
To suck the poison from my life
Just like an extra special cowboy villain
This was all balanced on my knife.

The ones who pay on judgement day
Will Jesus strike me down
If I should pray
This cowboy song is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
The distant sun
You, shining light
You'll be my dark sunshine
Tonight

Overnight overnight
All my distant sins are far.

This cowboy song  is all I know
To bring me back into your arms
This cowboy song, this cowboy life
I'll be your dark star shining
Tonight.

Dark star
Dark star
Dark star
Dark star
Dark star...
