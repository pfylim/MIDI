SNOWY WHITE - BIRD OF PARADISE

Slowly flying by
A flash of turquoise blue
Just had to try
To keep your life from view

Refrain:
My bird of paradise
Sweet bird of paradise

Wishing I could fly
I'd be beside you now
But I could only sigh
And watch you circle round

Refrain: ...(2x)...

My bird of paradise
Saw you fly away
When will you come again
So I can watch you play
In the pouring rain

Refrain: ...(2x)...

My bird of paradise
