Title  : My Ever Changing Moods
Singer : Style Council


Daylight turns to moonlight and I'm at my best
Praising the way it all works, gazing upon the rest
The cool before the warm
The calm after the storm
I wish to stay forever, letting this be my food
But I'm caught up in a whirlwind
And my ever changing moods

Bitter turns to sugar, some call a passive tune
But the day things turn sweet
For me won't be soon
The hush before the silence
The winds after the blast
I wish we'd move together, this time she bosses sued
But we're caught up in the wilderness
And an ever changing mood

Teardrops turn to children who've never had the time
To commit the sins they pay for through
Another's evil mind
The love after the hate
The love we leave too late
I wish we'd wake up on day an 'everyone feel moved
But we're caught up in the dailies
And an ever changing mood

Evil turns to statues and masses form a line
But I know which way I'd run to if the choice was mine
The past is knowledge, the present our mistake
And the future we always leave too late
I wish we'd come to our senses
And see there's no truth
In those who promote the confusion
For this ever changing mood
