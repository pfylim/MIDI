Title  : RUNAWAY BOYS
Artist : STRAY CATS

(Words & music: Setzer/ McDonnel)

Chorus:
Get kicked out for coming home at dawn
Your mum and dad cursed the day you were born
Throw your clothes into a duffel bag
Shouting and slam the door
At home it's a drag

Who can I turn to, where can I stay?
I've heard of places open all night and all day
There's a place you can go, where the cops don't know
You can act real wild
They don't treat you like a child

Runaway boys

Your hair's all greasy and you can't get a job
You're only 15 and you can't get a job
Run into the lunchette and shoot a few games
Who's a lonely boy, man, it's always the same
Steal a couple of bucks to buy a new toy
Slip into the alley with the runaway boys

Runaway boys

Running faster
Faster all the time
You're under age
And God knows that's a crime

Chorus: ...
