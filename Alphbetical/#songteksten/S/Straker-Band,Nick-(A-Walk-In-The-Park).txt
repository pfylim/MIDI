A walk in the park,
I've got to get some sense back into my head
I'm in the dark and I can't see where I am being led
I'd give the world to set the clock back and act like a man
where can I turn to save myself from this confusion.

A walk in the park, a step in the dark.
A walk in the park, a trip in the dark
I'm getting away escaping today.

A walk in the park
away from all the busy streets of my mind
I seek a straighter path
I seek a shady glade in which to unwind
but why do we go on in spite of mistakes, in spite of destruction
life can be fun depending on your situation.

A walk in the park, a step in the dark,...
