STAR SISTERS - A TRIBUTE TO MARILYN MONROE

The French are glad to - die for love
They delight in - fighting duels
But I prefer a man who lives
And gives expensive jewels

While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddie
But when I do I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes my heart belongs to daddy
Da da da da da da daha

So I want to warn you laddy
Tho' I know you're perfectly well
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy - he treats it so well

I wanna be loved by you
Just you, nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you - alone

I wanna inspire do anything higher
Than to feel the desire
To make you my own
Pa da pa di di li di di oeh

I wanna be loved by you
Just you, nobody else but you
I wanna be loved by you
Pa da pa da di li di di li oeh poeh
Pi do

A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girls best friend (2,3,4)
A kiss may be grand but won't pay the rental
On your humble flat or help you at the automat

Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all loose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't
loose their shape
Diamonds are a girls best friend

Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all loose our charms in the end
But square cut or pear shape these rocks don't
loose their shape
Diamonds, diamonds
I don't mean rhinestones
Diamonds are a girls best
Best friend
