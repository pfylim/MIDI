Singer : THE SWEET 
Title  : FOX ON THE RUN

Don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before
O.K. you think you got a pretty face
But the rest of you is out of place
You looked alright before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes arunning
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox on the run
Fox on the fun and hide away

You talk about just every band
But the names you drop are second hand
I've heard it all before
Don't wanna know your name
'Cause you don't look the same
The way you did before

Fox on the run
You scream and everybody comes arunning
Take a run and hide yourself away
Fox on the run
Fox on the fun and hide away
