Teeny hoper, my teenage lover,
I caught your waves last night
It set my mind a wond'rin'
You're such a groove please don't move
Please stay in my lovehouse by the river

Like I told you, can you dig it ?
If you want to groove I'll be glad to have you
I love you so please don't go
please stay here with me in Mendocino.

Mendocino, Mendocino, where life`s much a groove
You blow your mind in the morning
We used to walk trough the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino.
Fast talkin' guys,with strange red eyes
Have put things in your head
And set your mind a wond'rin'
I love yoe so please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino.

Like I told you, can you dig it ?
If you want to groove I'll be glad to have you
I love you so please don't go
Please stay here with me in Mendocino.

Mendocino,Mendocino, where life`s much a groove
You blow your mind in the morning
We used to walk trough the park
Make love along the way in Mendocino.

Mendocino,    Mendocino,    Mendocino
