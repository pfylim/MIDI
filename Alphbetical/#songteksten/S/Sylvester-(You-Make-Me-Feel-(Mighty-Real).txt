Title  : YOU MAKE ME FEEL (MIGHTY REAL)

(Words & music: Sylvester/Wirrick)

You make me feel, mighty real (5x)

When we're out there dancing on the floor, darling
And I feel like I need some more
And I feel your body close to mine
And I know my love it's about that time

Make me feel mighty real
Make me feel mighty real
You make me feel, mighty real
You make me feel, mighty real

When we get home darling
And it's nice and dark
And the music's in me
And I'm still real hot
Then you kiss me there
And it feels real good
And I know you'll love me
Like you should, yeah

Chorus:
Oh, you make me feel mighty real (3x)
Make me feel mighty real (4x)
I feel real, I feel real, I feel real real real
I feel real, I feel real, I feel real wooooh

I feel real, I feel real
Wooh, I feel real
I feel real, I feel real

You make me feel mighty real (4x)

Ooh, I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you kiss me
I feel real when you touch me
I feel real when you hold me

Chorus: ...
