Singer : SNOOPY
Title  : RAIN, SNOW AND ICE

(Words & music: Meijer/Jansen)

Chorus 1:
I don't like rain, hate snow and ice
Praying for some sunshine
I don't like rain, hate snow and ice
Ain't giving me a good time

Take me back to my sunny island
Take me back to my tropical land
Take me back to my sunny island
Far away from where it's cold and wet

Chorus 2:
January, your rain goes tick-tack-a-tie
February, brings snow, oh no
March, I'm still waiting for a sunny day
To put on my shoes and dance away

Chorus 1: ...
Chorus 2: ...
