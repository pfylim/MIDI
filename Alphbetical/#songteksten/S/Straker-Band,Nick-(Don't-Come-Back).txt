You, you say you're leaving me
You want your life to be the perfect mystery
When, when will you sort it out
That mind of yours I doubt will ever let you see
That you are living in unreality
And you are giving in far too easily
And you will realise, too late, you've run out of time.

So don't, don't come back
Although I want you back
Don't come back.
Don't, don't come back
Although I need you back, don't come back.

You, you want to be carefree
But want security
Why won't you ever see.
Soon, soon you will need someone
Someone to whom you'll run
For consolation.
But you are living in unreality
And you are giving in far too easily
And you will realise too late you've run out of time.


So don't, don't come back, ...

So don't, don't come back, ...
