Title  : YOUNG GIRL

(Words & music: Sue Saad/James Lance)

My mamma told me to be clean and behave
I'd always listen or she's slap me in the face
I never swore, I never said no dirty words
Didn't play with boys, 'cause mamma said I'd get hurt

When I was a young girl, oh oh oh
When I was a young girl, oh oh oh

I'd walk to school and skip the cracks in the cement
I use to watch the boys through the holes in the fence
I kept my distance, didn't wanna break the rules
I knew what mamma would say, but it seems so cruel

When I was a young girl, oh oh oh
When I was a young girl, oh oh oh
When I was a young girl
Remember, remember

Hey, mamma, can I go out tonight?
Please, mamma, there's a party tonight
Oh, daddy, won't ya say it's all right?
Please, daddy, won't ya say it's all right?
Oh, mamma, I'll behave myself
Promise I'll be home by quarter to twelve
Oh, daddy, won't you say it's all right?
Well, tell mamma it'll be all right for me
Please daddy, tell mamma it'll be all right, please

When I got older all my friends began to change
Since I learned to kiss the boys things have never been the same
I make my own choice now, I got my own way
Don't have to worry nomore 'bout what mamma might say

Like when I was a young girl, oh oh oh
Like when I was a young girl, oh oh oh
When I was a young girl
oh oh oh oh oh
