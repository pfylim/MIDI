Title  : A Good Heart
Singer : Feargal Sharkey


I hear a lot of stories
I suppose they could be true
All about love and what it can do to you
High is the risk of striking
Out the risk of getting hurt
And still I have so much to learn
Well I know 'cause I think about it all the time
I know that real love is quite a price

Chorus:
And a good heart these days
Is hard to find
True love the lasting kind
A good heart these days is hard to find
So please be gentle with this heart of mine

My expectations may be high
I blame that on my youth
Soon enough I'll learn the painful truth
I'll face it like a fighter
Then boast of how I've grown
Anything is better than being alone
Well I know 'cause I learn a little every day
I know 'cause I listen
When the experts say that...

Chorus

As I reflect on all my childhood dreams
My ideas of love
Weren't as foolish as they seemed
If I don't start looking now
I'll be left behind
And a good heart these days
It's hard to find
Well I know it's a dream
I'm willing to defend
I know it will all be worth it in the end

Chorus
