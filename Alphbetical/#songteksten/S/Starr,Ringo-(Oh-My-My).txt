Singer : RINGO STARR 
Title  : OH MY MY

I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said come on over I said do I have to
My knees started shaking my wrist started aching
When my doctor said to me

Oh my my oh my my can you boogie can you slide
Oh my my oh my my you can boogie if you try
Oh my my oh my my it's guaranteed to keep you alive

The head nurse she blew it just like a tornado
When they started dancing I jumped off the table
I felt myself heaving and as I was leaving
This is what my doctor said to me

Oh my my oh my my can you boogie can you slide
Oh my my oh my my can you boogie you can fly
Oh my my, if you try
It's guaranteed to keep you alive

Now if you should slow down and you're feeling low down
Don't call up the doctor just grab you a partner
It's what you've been missing I've got your prescription
That boogie woogie remedy

Oh my my oh my my you can boogie you can slide
Oh my my oh my my can we boogie till we die
Oh my my oh my my it's guaranteed to keep you alive
