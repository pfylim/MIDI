Title  : IT'S ME

(Words & music: A. Treffers/A.J. Britsnell/H. van Hooff)

So finally I look into the mirror
What do I see, oh, it's me
I feel a strange sensation
My mind can't get free, oh, it's me
Mink and diamonds, signs of wealth
Masquerade as someone else
Splintered mirror on the floor
Do I see more

Live my life, live my past
Found emotions that can't last
Friends I find just fade away
Only me, I stay

Refrain:
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me
Oh, can't you see
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me
Oh, can't you see
It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me
Oh, can't you see

Reflections from the wall
Don't they ever lie at all
It hurts not knowing who you are
Or when you go too far
Consider breakin' up my friend
When my thoughts collide
Oh, will I ever be free
From the fear that grows in me, in me
The vicious circle that I live
Only takes and will not give
Walk the world in shades of grey
Sun can't break my lonely way
I struggled, I took the blow
And now I still don't know

Refrain: ...
