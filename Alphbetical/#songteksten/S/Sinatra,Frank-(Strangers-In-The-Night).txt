
              Strangers in the night



Strangers in the night , exchanging glances ,
Wond'ring in the night , what were the chances ?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through.
Something in your eyes was so inviting,
Something in your smile was so exiting,
Something in my heart told me I must have you.

Strangers in the night , two lonely people ,
We were strangers in the night up to the moment
When we said our first hello.
Little did we know ,love was just a glance away ,
A warm embracing dance away.

And ever since that night we've been together,
Lovers at first sight in love forever,
It turned out so right for strangers in the night.

Love was just a glance away , a warm embracing dance away ,
Ever since that night we've been together...
