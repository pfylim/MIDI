ROD STEWART - LOST IN YOU

(Words & music: Rod Stewart/Andy Taylor)

Hey baby you been on my mind tonight
I'm so lonely I just had to sit down and write
I spent all yesterday
Trying to figure out what I'm gonna say
A letter from my heart
Is so hard to start, baby
How's your momma, how's the weather
How's that son of mine

Hey baby been a long time since we made love
I'm stone cold, the bed's hard, and the work is tough
I'm never gonna leave you again
This job ain't worth the pain
No money in the world ain't worth
Being away from you
Ooh baby I don't sleep without you by my side
Listen

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
But so much more than that
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you

Hey baby you don't know what you've done for me
I'm so happy as any man can deserve to be
I was living in a life of sin
God knows what a mess I was in
So glad you fond me
I ain't getting any younger
Hey baby I just hope it ain't all a dream

I'm in love with you woman
It's a common known natural fact
And I've found what I'm looking for
But so much more than that
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you
I'm lost in you

I miss your laughing eyes
I miss our baby crying
I want to lay you out, and kiss you all over
I'm coming home real soon
Be ready cause when I do
I'm gonna make love to you
Like fifteen men
I'm lost in you, and I love it
I'm lost in you, and I love it
I'm lost in, I'm lost in, I'm lost in you
I'm lost in, I'm lost in, I'm lost in you
And I just love it, hey baby I love it
Child I love it, I'm lost in you
