Title  : ROCK THIS TOWN
Artist : STRAY CATS

(Words & music; Brian Setzer)

Well, my baby and me went out late last saturday night
I had my hair piled high and my baby just looked so right
We'll pick you up at ten
Gotta have you home by two
Mama don't know what I catched off you
But that's alright, 'cause we're looking as cool as can be

Well, we found a little place that really didn't look half bad
I had a whisky on the rocks
And change of a dollar for the jukebox
Well, I put cold rock into that can
But all they played was disco man
Come on baby, let's get out of here right away

Chorus:
We're gonna rock this town, rock it inside out
We're gonna rock this town, make 'em scream and shout
Let's rock, rock and rock, I'm gonna rock till we pop
Gonna rock till we drop
We're gonna rock this town, rock it inside out

Well, we're having a ball just a-bopping on the big dance floor
Well, there's a real square cat, he looks a 1974
Wel, he look at me once, he look at me twice
Look at me again and there's gonna be a fight
We're gonna rock this town
Gonna rip his place apart

Chorus: ...
