The higher you build your barriers,the taller I become

The farther you take my rights away, the faster I will run

You can deny me, you can decide to turn..your face..away

No matter cause there's


SOMETHING INSIDE SO STRONG, I KNOW THAT I CAN MAKE IT

THOUGH YOU'RE DOING ME WRONG SO WRONG

YOU THOUGHT THAT MY PRIDE WAS GONE, OH NO

THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE SO STRONG, OOOOH, SOMETHING INSIDE SO STRONG


The more you refuse to hear my voice (OEWEE OEWEE OEWEE OEWEE)

The louder I will sing

You hide behind walls of Jericho (OEWEE OEWEE OEWEE OEWEE)

Your lies will-come tumbeling

Deny my place in time, you squander wealth that's mine

My light will shine so brightly it will blind you

Because there's

HERHAAL REFREIN

BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WHEN THEY INSIST WE'RE JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH

WHEN WE KNOW BETTER,JUST LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND SAY

WE'RE GONNA DO IT ANYWAY, WE'RE GONNA DO IT ANYWAY
