Title  : JEALOUSY

(Words & music: B. Lengs/S. May/G. Morris)

As I look into your eyes
I see the doubts and realise
You saw me with a friend, we share
You take it as a love affari
You gotta hol on me, a guarantee
I don't wanna lose you
But the more I'm free
The less I'd be
Likely to deceive you, jealousy
Why are you (jealousy)
Jealous of me
Jealousy is this how it's gonna be
Jealousy

You may play this lovers game
Pretending that you feel no pain
Thinking that you're hurting me
You mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away jealousy
Why are you (jealousy)
Jealous of me
Jealousy is this how it's gonna be
Jealousy

It's just the jealousy, jealous, jealous, jealousy
But you're the casualty you mean so much to me
I'm begging you to throw away your jealousy
Why are you (jealousy)
Jealous of me
Jealousy is this how it's gonna be
Jealousy

If you read between the lines
Or question all my alibies
You may think you know it all
But who can tell where lovers fall
Jealousy
