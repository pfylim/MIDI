Title  : I WROTE YOU A LETTER

I wrote you a letter to make you mine again, oh girl
I wrote you a letter to explain
The world is smaller than the love I've got
So won't you please please please read my letter

All I want is a girl like you, oh baby
All I want is that my dreams come true
So if you didn't find someone new
Won't you please please please answer my letter
Won't you please please please read my letter
