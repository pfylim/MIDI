  Singer  : SLADE 
  Title   : UNIVERSE
  Written : By Jim Lea

  I was coming home
  I was all alone
  In a place so cold I don 't feel
  I was there for years
  So afraid of fears
  I was lost and I was the curse

  Oh won 't you be my universe

  Oh Yeh

  I can hear the sound
  I can hear it loud
  Of the beat before time was dawn
  Through the fire and rain
  I can feel no pain
  Won 't you be the last like the first
  Oh won 't you be my universe

  How much have I travelled
  How much have I seen
  Is this reality
  Or a broken dream
  Woh Woh

  Through the raging storm
  Won 't you keep me warm
  I 'm the hunger, I am the thirst
  Oh won 't you be my universe
