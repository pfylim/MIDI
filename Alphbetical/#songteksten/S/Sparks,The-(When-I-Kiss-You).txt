
11. When I Kiss You - Sparks

Out of the doorway
Into the morning
Wish I was a bird
That was migratory
Spoken half in jest
Catch the bird
That's in my nest.

Out of the doorway
Into the morning
All of them seem 
To be selling something 
Illegal substances
Hold me now
But with no kisses
Though I'm tempted
They'll be emptied
You and your rosary
Are exempted
From the reality
Still there is a virtuality.

You'll never know it
I'll never show it
Only I hear it
Only I know that
What's abnormal for me
Made for thee be glass for me.

And the hills are alive
With the sound of music.

When I kiss you
When I kiss you
On the jolly path of failing
Will I miss you?
Will I miss you?
When the playing is on high
When I kiss you
When I kiss you
On the jolly path of failing
Will I miss you?
Will I miss you?
When I finally see the light?

Where are they going?
What are they doing?
Who are they chasing?
Who are they suing?
It's all except OK
In this fancy William's play.

What are they facing?
Who are they casing?
When you're attracted
Tell me who are you macing?
For me it's all just fun
'Cause she's a friend
Going great design.

Find yourself immaterial
A little lace and metric girl
But that's the way it goes
My life on verges it grows and grows
It's bigger than froogy
It's bigger than froogy
Sometimes she's a little screwy
But all that is upset
When we dispense with medikit.

And the hills are alive
With the sound of music.

CHORUS:
When I kiss you
When I kiss you
On the jolly path of failing
Will I miss you?
Will I miss you?
When the playing is on high
When I kiss you
When I kiss you 
On the jolly path of failing
Will I miss you?
Will I miss you?
When I finally see the light?

Out of the doorway
Into the morning
Wish I was a bird
That was predatory
Spoken half in jest
Catch the bird
That's in my nest.

As rebel advance
There's lyric dispute
Somebody shouts us
Somebody shoots us
And hits the bull's-eye, damn
Captured at the border camp.

And the hills are alive
With the sound of music.

CHORUS
