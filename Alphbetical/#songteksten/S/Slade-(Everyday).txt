Title  : EVERYDAY

Ev'ry day when I'm away I'm thinking of you
Ev'ryone can carry on except for we two
And you know that our that our love and you know
that I and you know that our love won't die
And it won't even show and no one will know
One little wave to say you'll behave
It won't even show how far love can go

Ev'ry day when I'm away and there's been a few
Ev'ry land I need a hand to help me come through
And you know that our that our love and you know
that I and you know that our love won't die
And it won't even show and no one will know
One little wave to say you'll behave
It won't even show how far love can go

And you know that our that our love and you know
that I and you know that our love won't die
And it won't even show and no one will know
One little wave to say you'll behave
It won't even show how far love can go
