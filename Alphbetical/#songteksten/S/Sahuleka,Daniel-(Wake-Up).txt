Title  : Wake Up
Singer : Daniel Sahuleka


Saturday, I can't forget that day
The night was cool
When we went out to dance
It's hard to believe,
but I was refused in a nightclub
I don't understand, I can't understand
It feels so cold, reality, nothing but reality

Chorus:
Wake up, let's put our hands together
It's time to fight for human rights (2x)

This old world is everybody's world
Black or white has got to be one world
So many times and so many slogans
And still without success
Now where's the start, the hope of love?
A storm is threatening,
It's gonna be a long hot summer.

Chorus (2x)
