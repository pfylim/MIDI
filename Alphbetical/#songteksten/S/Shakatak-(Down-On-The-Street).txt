SHAKATAK - DOWN ON THE STREET

Tonight's the night, we've waited for
A time to sing and dance like never before
The street's alive with such a carnival air
And all-night dancin' party everywhere

You and I, were happy to be
Just a part of this crazy scene

Refrain:
Down on the street
Shoutin' talkin' laughin'
Down on the street
Down on the street
Snappin' fingers dancin'
Down on the street
Down on the street
Shoutin' talkin' laughin'
Down on the street
Down on the street

Tonight's the night, you'll never forget
The best time in your life that you'll ever get
New lovers meet as they dance through the night
The moonlight falls on this magical sight

You and I, were happy to be
Just a part of this crazy scene

Refrain: ...
