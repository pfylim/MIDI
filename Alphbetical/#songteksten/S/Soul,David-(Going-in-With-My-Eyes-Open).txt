Title  : GOING IN WITH MY EYES OPEN

(Words & music: Tony Macauly)

You smiled that misty way
And something in me say
Remember the last time
Don't fall in love
I walked so blindly in
I fell and hurt my head
I can't forget it
But I don't regret it
I couldn't even stop it if I tried

Refrain:
Only this time I'm going in
With my eyes open
Won't make the same mistakes again
This time I've seen the signs
And no heart's broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way

You'd be so nice to love
Don't let it end the same
If you get uneasy
Just let me know (but please)
Don't lie or call me
By somebody else's name
Oh I couldn't take it
I know I would break it
And I want to give you everything I have

Refrain: ...
