Title  : SHADY LADY

Shady lady
You've been hanging round a week or more
Shady lady
Don't you know that it's against the law
Shady lady
I can see you hiding round those corners
Shady lady
And I think I'm gonna have to warn you
Shady lady
I can't take it
Shady lady
You won't make it

Wicked woman
You're the meanest woman that I've seen
Wicked woman
Did you really think that I was green
Wicked woman
Do you really think that you're so smart
Wicked woman
Trying to rob me of my only heart
Wicked woman
I can't make it
Wicked woman
You won't make it

I'm gonna call up the CID and the FBI and the KGB
Listen I'm gonna call up those influential faces
My influential friends in influential places

Shady lady
You had better get off on the double
Shady lady
'Cause you might find yourself in trouble
Shady lady
I'm the only human lie detector
Shady lady
I can see you're just a love collector
Shady lady
I can't take it
Shady lady
You won't make it

Murky mistress
You must think that I'm an easy target
Murky mistress
Just another for your loving market
Murky mistress
Don't you know that you're the kind of mean
Murky mistress
I'm not gonna be your love machine
Murky mistress
I can't take it
Murky mistress
You won't make it
