ALL THIS TIME - STING


I looked out the river today I saw a city in the fog
And an old church tower Where the seagulls play
I saw the sad shire horses walking home In the sodium light
I saw two priests on the ferry 
October geese on a cold winter's night
And all this time, the river flowed Endlessly to the sea
Two priests came round our house tonight One young, one old
To offer prayers for the dying To serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach Which way the cold wind blows
Fussing and flapping in priestly black Like a murder of crows
And all this time, the river flowed Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way I'd take a boat from the river
And I'd bury the old man I'd bury him at sea

Blessed are the poor For they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor Than a fat man in the eye of a needle
And as these words were spoken I swear I hear
The old man laughing What good is a used up world
And how could it be Worth having
And all this time the river flowed Endlessly like a silent tear
And all this time the river flowed Father, if Jesus exists
Then how come he never lived here The teachers told us
The roans built this place They built a wall and a temple
An edge of the empire Garrison town
They lived and they died They prayed to their gods
But the stone gods Did not make a sound
And their empire crumbled 'Til all that was left
Were the stones The workman found
