Singer : SLADE 
Title  : FAR FAR AWAY 
 
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi 
I've seen the bridges of the world and they're for real 
I've had a red light of the wrist without me even gettin' 
kissed, it still seems so unreal 
 
I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska 
I've seen the sunset in the east and in the west 
I've sang the glory that was Rome 
And passed the Hound Dog Singer's Home 
It still seems for the best 
 
Refrain: 
And I'm far far away with my my head up in the clouds 
And I'm far far away with my feet up in the crowds 
Lettin' loose around the world 
But the call of home is loud still as loud 
 
I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre 
And felt the silence hanging low in no mans land 
And all those Spanish nights were fine 
It wasn't only from the wine 
 
Refrain: ... 
 
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi 
The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on 
And all those Arigato smiles 
Stay in your memory for a while 
There seems more to come 
 
Refrain: ...
