5. Heart Of Stone - Dave Stewart

I bought your record in NYC
Discorama down on Union Square
I must have played it a million times over
I'd close my eyes imagine you were there you know
I really dig the clothes you wear
I only wish you could be my baby
I want to read about it
do you think we could have an affair

Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see
Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see

Two weeks in ElectricLady Land
Two weeks and that's all for me
I could be lucky and get off lightly
With a broken nose and the third degree
She said I really dig Disco music
And if you want to be my baby
We'd better talk about it
Maybe then we could have an affair

Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see
Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see

I want to drive east coast to west coast
Turn up my radio set myself free
Don't want to talk about it
You and me should have an affair

Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see
Maybe your heart is made of stone
Maybe I'm just too blind to see
