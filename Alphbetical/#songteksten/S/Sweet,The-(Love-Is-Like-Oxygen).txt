Singer : SWEET 
Title  : LOVE IS LIKE OXYGEN

(Words & music: Andrew Scott/Travor Griffin)

Chorus:
Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
No enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time on my side, I got it all
I've heard that pride
Always comes before a fall
There's a rumor going round the town
That you don't want me around
Every way I turn I lose

Chorus: ...

Time is no healer if you're not there
Lonely fever, sad words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

Chorus: ...
