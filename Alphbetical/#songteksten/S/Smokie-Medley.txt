We got to say that we remember you
Sorry that those days are gone and dreams are out of the blue...
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her 
make sure you're thinkin' of her
And everything you're sayin' is true
I saw her today, I saw her face
And what a face I love
And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray
That they go away
But still they begin
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide
But still they begin
Needles and pins
But still they begins 
The needles and pins
Oh I was alive
And so it begins
Foolishly layin' the hearts on the table
Stumblin' in
Her love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then fire light will catch you stumblin' in
Wherever you go
Whatever you you do
You know this reckless puzzled man's followin' you
So she cries just a little for a few dollars more 
She lies just a little like she's done it before
She'll take it, she'll fake it for a few dollars more
She'll show you her heart, then she'll show you the door
If you want my simpathy
Just open your heart to me
You're getting whatever you'll ever need
You think that's too hard for you, babe
I would die for you
When there's nothing left
You know where I'll be
Lay back in the arms of someone
Give in to the charms of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
Lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
Lay back in the arms of someone you love
So if you think you know how to love me
And if you think she knows what I mean
And if you really, really want me to stay
You gotta believe the way
Yes if you think you know how to love me
And if you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay
You gotta believe the way
Sally called when she got the word
She said "I suppesed you've heard...about Alice"
When I rushed to the window
And I looked outside
And I could hardly believe in my eyes
A big limousine rolled up into Alice's drive
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving
Nor where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice
24 years just waiting for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling and maybe get a second chance
Now I've got to get used not to living next door to Alice.

Mexican girl, don't leave me alone
I've got a heart as big as a stone
And I need you believe me to be here and love me tonight
