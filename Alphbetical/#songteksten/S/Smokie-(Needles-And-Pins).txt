Title  : NEEDLES AND PINS

(Words & music: Jack Nitzsche/Sonny Bono)

I saw her today
I saw her face
It was a face of love
And I knew I had to run away-yi-ay
And get down on my knees and pray-yay
That they'd go away
Still they'd begin
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide

Hey I thought I was smart
I'd won her heart
Didn't think I'd do
But now I see she's worse to him than me
Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see
Just how to say please
And get down on her knees
Hey that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Hurt'n her, hurt'n her

Why can't I stop
And tell myself I'm wrong
I'm wrong so wrong
Why can't I stand up
And tel myself I'm strong
