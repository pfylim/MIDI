Title  : RAGTIME PIANO JOE

(Words & music: Don Frazer)

The man who made his name in the moving picture show
Was the man whose face we saw but whos voice we didn't know
The only things we heard him say were on cards we read too slow
The man who made him speak was Ragtime Piano Joe

Chorus:
It was the only life that he knew
Ragtime Piano Joe
It was the only thing he could do
Ragtime Piano Joe
And when the heroes walked in the door
And Charlie Chaplin fell through the floor
Who was it made the show
Ragtime Piano Joe

Al Jolson mooned and crooned
And talking pictures came to town
Hoagy Carmichael played the tune
It really brought you down
Then Busby Barclay clinched the deal
And all the films had sound
Joe took his life one night
They say that he was drowned

Chorus: ...

And when the heroe walked in the door
And Charlie Chaplin fell through the floor
Who was it, who was it
Ragtime Piano Joe

It's late at night and to the movie house you go
Sit at the back, stay out of sight
You can still hear Ragtime Joe
Then the crowds had gone
The old time songs
The ones we used to know
Can still be heard but very faint
It's the ghost of poor old Joe

Chorus: ...
