Title  : THERE'S A SONG
Artist : SASKIA & SERGE

(Words & music: Saskia & Serge)

Chorus:
There's a song
That wanna make you happy
There's a star
Shining just for you
There's a friend
Walking right beside you
If you wanna see it
You'll be happy too

When I was a child
Mama always used to sing
This song for me
Still it's telling me everything
Every word is true
So I will keep it in mind
When the road is long
And the load gets heavier
This little song
Makes it easier to bear

Chorus: ...
So I write the songs
That make me feel glad inside
And I pick the stars
As on ode to the morninglight
Every day's a chance
To discover it's making friends
If you open up your heart
And face life with a smile
You can make it all
You can make it
You can make it
You can make it all worth while
