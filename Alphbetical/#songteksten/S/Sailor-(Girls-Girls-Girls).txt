2x

Well, yellow, red, black or white, add a little bit of moonlight
for this intercontinental romance.
Shy girl, sexy girl, they all like that fancy world,
champagne, a gentle song and a slow dance.
Who makes it fun to spend your money ?
Who calls you "honey", 'most ev'ry day-ay ?

ZwischenstÅck:
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls.
Well, they made'em up in Hollywood an put'em into the movies,
those lovely photographic splendours.
In and out of magazines, Miss World and beauty queens,
falling in love with the real big spenders.
But although their world may be frantic,
they're still romantic in their own way-ay -

Refrain:
Hop on, the world is swinging, don't sit and twiddle your thumbs,
get up and meet those pretty girls, girls, gi-irls.
Step on, the world keeps swinging, put on the dazzling charm.
Get up and find those pretty girls -
But don't rush, keep it nice and gentle and sentimental,
for that certain mo-ment...

Bridge
Moonlit oceans, girls full of emotions
stepping on that slow boat to China.
Next door, in Japan, they know how to please a man
dropping in for tea for my geisha.
They've got that oldfashioned feeling,
when it comes to pleasing they know their way-ay -

Refrain:
Hop on, the world is swinging, don't sit and twiddle your thumbs,
get up and meet those pretty girls, girls, gi-irls.
Step on, the world keeps swinging, put on the dazzling charm.
Get up and find those pretty girls -
But don't rush, keep it nice and gentle and sentimental,
for that certain moment, when it goes like the curtain!
1/3 vom Refrain:
Hop on, the world is swinging, don't sit and twiddle your thumbs,
get up and meet those pretty girls -

Chor
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls,
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls
