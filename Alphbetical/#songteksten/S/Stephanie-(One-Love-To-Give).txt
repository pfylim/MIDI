ONE LOVE TO GIVE

ONE
you're in my dreams
A maze of love intrigue
And passion TWO
Making me scheme
You feed the flame with your devotion
THREE
I long to see
Beyond the tears and tenderness
That I'm one
Who makes your dreams come true
We'll be together
--------------------------------------------------------
One love to give one song to sing
Two hearts to live in harmony
Our chance is just one step away
Time for us to say
One love to share one song to sing
Two hearts to care in harmony
Our chance is just one step away
Time for us to say
Time for us to say
Time for us to say
--------------------------------------------------------
Star
Distant and reel
You shine your light on our tomorrows
Two
Children are we
Enchanted by the nights that follow
Fly
Bird on the wing
How beautiful to rise above
And fall in love
The way we have today
Is it forever?
