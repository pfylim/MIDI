Title  : Nelson Mandela
Singer : The Special Aka


Free Nelson Mandela
Free, free, free free free Nelson Mandela
Free Nelson Mandela

Twenty-one years in captivity
His shoes too small to fit his feet
His body abused but his mind is still free
Are you so blind that you cannot see
I say

Free Nelson Mandela
I'm begging you
Free Nelson Mandela

He pleaded the causes of the ANC
Only one man in a large army
Are you so blind that you cannot see
Are you so deaf that you cannot hear his plea

Free Nelson Mandela
I'm begging you
Free Nelson Mandela

Twenty-one years in captivity
Are you so blind that you cannot see
Are you so deaf that you cannot hear
Are you so dumb that you cannot speak
I say

Free Nelson Mandela
I'm begging you 
Oh free Nelson Mandela, free Nelson Mandela, begging you, 
  begging you
Please free Nelson Mandela, free
Nelson Mandela, I'm telling you
You've got to free Nelson Mandela
