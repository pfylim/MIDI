(Words & music: Sylvia Robinson/Guy O'Brien/Michael Wright/Henry

Said a hip hop, the hibbit, the hippidibibby hip hip hoppa, you 
don't stop
Rouck it out to the boogie da bang-bang, boogie to the boogie da beat
Now what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove an' my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say hello
To the black, the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first I gotta bang-bang boogie to the boogie
Said up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that makes your body rock
Well, so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends aling
And next on the mike is my man Hank, c'mon Hank, sing that song

Check it out, I'm Imp the dimp, the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grand master with the three MC's
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when I come inside into the front
You do the freak, spank or do the bump
And when the sucker MC's try to prove a point
From sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating master piece,
Gonna rock the mike so you can't resist
Everybody, said it goes like this
Well, I was coming home late one dark afternoon
A reporter stop me from an interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mike and the turn table
This young reporter I did adore
So I rock a vicious rhyme like she never heard before
She said: damn fly guy, I'm in love with you
That Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby, what's your name?
She said I go by the name of Lois Lane
And you can be my boyfriend, you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said: he's a fairy, I do supposse
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said: yu need a man who has finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party till the early light?
He can satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
Igo do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
And I'm here, and I'm there, I'm big bad Hank, I'm everywhere
So throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, don't stop y'all
Take a truck y'all, you don't stop
You go hotel, motel, what you gonna do today (Say wha-at)
I'm gonna get a fly girl, get some spank and drive off in a death 
O.J.
Everybody go hotel, motel, holiday inn
You say if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends
I go skip, dive, what can I say
I can't fit them all inside my O.J.
So I just take half and bust them out
I give the rest to Master G so he can shock the house

Well, a M A S, a T E R, G with a double E
Said I go byt the unforgettable name of the man they call Master G
Well, my name is known all over the world
By all the foxy ladies and pretty girls
I'm going down in history
As the baddest rapper there ever could be
Now you're feeling the highs and you're feeling the lows
And the beat starts getting into your toes
You start popping your fingers and stomping your feet
And moving your body while you're sitting in your seat
And the DAMN, you start doin' the freak, I said DAMN, right out of 
your seat
Then you throw your hands high in the air
And rock to the rhythm, shake your derriere
Rock it to the beat without a care
We're the sure shot MC's for the affair
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I rap to the beat just the same
I got a little face and a pair of brown eyes
And all I'm here to do ladies is hypnotize
Singing on and on and a on, on, on, on
The beat don't stop till the break of dawn
Like a hot buttered pop-a-pop-pop-pop-op-op-hip-hap-pop
You don't dare stop
Come alive, give me what you got
I guess by now you can take a hunch
And find that I am the baby of the bunch
But that's ok, I still keep in stride
'Cause  all I'm here to do is wiggle your behind
Singing on and on and on, on, on
The beat don't stop till the break of dawn
Singing on and on and a on, on, on, on
Like a rock y'all throw it on the floor
Well, I freak it here and a freak it there
I'm gonna move you out of this atmosphere
'Cos I'm one of a kind and I'll shock your mind
I put the dip dip hip in your behind
I said 1,2,3,4 come on girls get on the floor
Come alive y'all, give me what you got
'Cos I'm guaranteed to make you rock
I said 1,2,3,4 tell me Wonder Mike what you waiting for

I said a hip hop the hibbit, the hippidibby hip hip-hop
Hoppa you don't stop the rocka to the bang-bang boogie
Said up jump the boogie, to the rhythm of the boogie da beat
Skiddely be bop, we rock-a-scoobie do
Guess what america, we love you
'Cause you rock and roll with so much soul
You can rock till you're hundred and one years old
I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast
But we're like hot butter on breakfast toast
A rock it out baby bubba, baby bubba to the boogie
To the bang-bang boogie, to the beat, beat
It's so unique, come on everybody and dance to the beat
Have you ever went over a friends hous to eat
And the food just ain't no good
I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas all mushed
And the chicken tastes like wood
So you try to play it off like you think you can
By saying that you're full
And your friend says: Mama he's just being polite
He ain't finished, uh uh, that's bull
So your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie
And say that you already ate
And your friend says: man there's plenty of food
So he piles some more on your plate
While the stinky food's streaming,
Your mind starts to dreaming
Of the moment it's time to leave
And you look at your plate and your chicken slowly rotted
Into something that looks like cheese
So you say: that's it, I've got to leave this place
I don't care what these people think
I'm just sitting here making myself nauseaous
With this ugly food that stinks
So you bust out the door while it's still closed
Stille sick from the food you ate
And you run to the store for quick relief
For a bottle of Kaopectate
And then you call your friend two weeks later
To see how he has been
And he says: I understand about the food, baby bubba
But we're still friends
With a hip hop, the hibbit, the hippidibby hip hip hoppa
you don't stop the rocka to the bang-bang boogie, said up
Jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie da beat
