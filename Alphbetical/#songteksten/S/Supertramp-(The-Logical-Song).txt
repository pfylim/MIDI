Title  : THE LOGICAL SONG

(Words & music: Davies/Hodgson)

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well they'd be singing so happily
Joyfully, playfully, watching me
But then they sent me away
To teach me how to be sensible
Logical, responsible, practical
And they showed me a world 
Where I could be so dependable
Clinical, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please
Please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am

Now watch what you say 
Or they'll be calling you a radical
Liberal, fanatical, criminal
Won't you sign up your name
We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, presentable, a vegetable

At night when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please
Please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am
