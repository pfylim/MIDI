Singer : THE SPINNERS 
Title  : THE RUBBERBAND MAN

(Words & music: L. Creed/T. Bell)

Hand me down my walking cane
Hand me down my hat
Hurry now and don't be late
'Cause we ain't got the time to chat
You and me were goin' out
To catch the latest sound
Guaranteed to blow your mind
So high you won't come down

Hey, ya'll prepare yourself
For the rubberband man
You've never heard a sound
Like the rubberband man
You're bound to loose control
When the rubberband starts to jam

Once I went to hear them play
At a club outside up town
I was hypnotized
By the sound these cats put down
When I saw this short fat guy
Stretch a band between his toes
Hey, I laughed so hard
'Cause the band got down
When it finally reached his nose, oh

Do doop doop doop doop do doop do doop
