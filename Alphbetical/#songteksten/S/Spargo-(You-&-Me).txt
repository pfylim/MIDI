Beide: Baby can't you see
Er:    I wanna talk it over
Beide: Baby you and me
Er:    We'll find a four leaf clover
Beide: Baby I can't see you
Er:    I wanna talk it over
Beide: Baby you and me
Er:    We'll find a four leaf clover soon.

Er:    Walkin' thru' the rain
       Feelin' so much better
       Wash away the pain,
       Tryin' to forget her.
       ('Cause you know what she said)
Sie:   Baby can't you see
       We're not good for each other
       Baby you and me
       Can't play mother and father
       I just can't be free
       When you're sayin' what's the matter
       Baby you and me
       We just cannot be together.

Beide: Baby, can't you see, ...

Sie:   Walkin' thru' the rain
       Feelin' that I miss him
       Got a lot of pain
       'Cause I can't be with him
Er:    (But you can be with me oh, yeah)
       One day you will see
       You've got to show your emotions
       Give your heart to me,
       We'll love each other with devotion
Sie:   Baby now I see
       We are birds of feather,
       baby you and me
       We just got to be together

Beide: Baby can't you see, ...
Beide: Baby now we see
       We were meant for each other
       baby you and me
       Can play mother and father
       baby now we see
       We were meant for each other
       baby you and me
       Can you play mother and father
       Baby now we see
       You and me
       Baby now w$ see, ...
