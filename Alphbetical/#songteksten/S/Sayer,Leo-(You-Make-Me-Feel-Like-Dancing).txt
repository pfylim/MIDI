Title  : YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE DANCING

(Words & music: Sayer/Poncia)

You've got a cute way of talking
You got the better of me
Just snap your fingers and I'm walking
Like a dog hanging on your lead

I'm in a spin you know
Shaking on a string, you know

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing

I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing

Quarter to four in the morning
I ain't feeling tired, no no no no no
Just hold me tight and leave on the light
'Cause I don't want to go home

You put a spell on me
Right where you want me to be

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing

I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing

Do do do do do do

And if you'll let me stay
We'll dance our lifes away

You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing
I'm gonna dance the night away
You make me feel like dancing

I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
Dance the night away
I feel like dancing, dancing
