But if only you could see them
You would know from their faces
There were kings and queens
Followed by princes and princesses
There were future power people
Throwing love to the loveless
Shining a light
'Cause they wanted it seen
Well there were cries of why not
Can I reach out for you
If that feels good to me
--------------------------------------------------------
And riders will not stop us
Cause the only love they'll find
Is paradise
And the riders will not stop us
Cause the only love they'll find
Is paradise, paradise
--------------------------------------------------------
Don't you know that
Rasciam in amongst future kings
Can only lead to no good
And besides your sons and daughters
Already know how that feels
One day all the queens
Will gather round
Spreading love and unity
So it can be found
But then the bike riders will say
It's all to do with drugs
Well inject me with your love
Inject me with your love alright
--------------------------------------------------------
   And the riders will not stop us
   Cause the only drug they'll find
   Is paradise, future love paradise
--------------------------------------------------------
One in the night
Is gonna make you feel good
Coming at you like a hurricane would
Stay close to me
I'll always be by your side
Say you will
You know that it is alright
You remind me of a girl I knew
Love's so beautiful once inside you
You make me feel
Like I need your love
Love love
Well fill me with your love
Fix me with your love alright
--------------------------------------------------------
   And the riders will not stop us
   Cause the only drug they'll find
   Is paradise, future love paradisee
