9. UNDER THE MOON OF LOVE

Chorus
Let`s go for a little walk
Under the moon of love.
Let`s sit down and talk
Under the moon of love.
I wanna tell you
That I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling let`s walk
Let`s talk under the moon of love.

You where looking so lovely
Under the moon of love.
Your eyes shining so brightly
Under the moon of love.
I wanna go all the time
And you be my love tonight
Little darling let`s walk
Let`s talk under the moon of love.

I wanna talk sweet talk
And whisper tings in your ear.
I`m gonna tell you lots of things
I know you`ve been longing to hear.

Come on little darling take my hand.

Chorus

I wanna tell you
That I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling let`s walk
Let`s talk under the moon of love.

I wanna talk sweet talk
And whisper tings in your ear.
I`m gonna tell you lots of things
I know you`ve been longing to hear.

Come on little darling take my hand.

Repeat and fade out
Let`s go for a little walk
Under the moon of love.
