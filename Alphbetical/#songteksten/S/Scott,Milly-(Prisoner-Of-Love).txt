MILLY SCOTT - PRISONER OF LOVE

You know I can't seem to break away
from this loving man who keeps me every day
with his magical touch I'm hooked on his love
Yes, I am
My friends always tell me I'm a fool
to put up with the pain he puts me thru'
but he's oh so sweet I'm so blind?
I just can't get him out of my mind

Refrain:
I'm a prisoner of love
I just can't break away, I need him every day
I'm a prisoner, I'm just a prisoner of love

I try to run I try to hide
but I can't change the way I feel inside
he treats me bad and walks away, oh the pain
makes me feel so good inside
and when he wraps his magic chain around me
my whole body starts to glow
then he'll tease me oh and squeeze me
and drive me out of control

Refrain: ...

He's my loverboy he gives me so much joy
I leave him every day
sometimes he treats me oh so bad
he even makes me mad
I need him so I just can't break away
there's one thing that's guaranteed:
I get his love and that's all I need

Refrain:
I'm a prisoner of love
I really love him so I just can't let him go
I'm a prisoner, I'm just a prisoner of love
