Title  : DON'T TELL ME STORIES

voice:
Hello darling
I see, you're not coming home tonight
Well,m what am I suppose to say
Yes, I know the reason
Goodbye

Refrain:
Don't tell me stories
You know that I love you
And when you lie to me
I hear it in your voice
Do you remember
The times we shared together
Don't let it be over
Don't hurt me again

You are my love
You're all I've part
My all, my everything
We cannot be part
When you're gone
And I'm alone
i wonder what went wrong with our love
I can't forget all the love
We shared together

Refrain: ...

voice:
Maybe it's not right to call you now
But I can't stand it anymore
I want to tell you so many things
Please, please pick up the phone
When you are gone, and I'm alone
I wonder what went wrong with our love
I can't forget all the love we shared together

Don't tell me stories
You know that I love you
Don't let it be over
Don't hurt me again
Don't let it be over
Don't hurt me again
