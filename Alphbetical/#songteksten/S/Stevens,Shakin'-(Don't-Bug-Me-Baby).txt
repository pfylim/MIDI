Well, don't bug me baby,
with your "Go, Go, Go"
don't drive me crazy
with your "Go, Go, Go"
don't bug me baby,
I love you goodness knows.
Well, don't bug me baby,
don't treat me like clay,
don't make me love you,
then you turn away,
don't bug me baby, with your Yak-e-ta-Yak
don't waste the evening just chewing the fat.

I said don't, baby don't treat me mean,
well, I don't wanna bug in my lovin' machine.
when I'm a romancing don't look at me please,
when I want a kiss,
don't turn your cheek,
when I wanna cuddle don't tell me maybe,
when I want lovin' I want you baby.
I said don't baby don't treat me mean,
well, I don't wanna bug in my lovin' machine.

when I'm a romancing don't look at me please,
when I want a kiss,
don't turn your cheek,
when I wanna cuddle don't tell me maybe,
when I want lovin' I want you baby.
I said don't baby don't treat me mean,
well, I don't wanna bug in my lovin' machine.
Well, don't bug me baby,

Well, don't bug me baby,
when you know it ain't right,
you squirm like a lizard when you hold me tight,
don't keep a jumpin' like a frog in a bag,
and don't start ziggin' when I wanna zag.

I said don't baby don't treat me mean,
well, I don't wanna bug in my lovin' machine.
Well, don't bug me baby,
well, don't bug me baby,
well, don't bug me baby.
