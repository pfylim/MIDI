SOUL SISTER - THE WAY TO YOUR HEART

(Words & music: J. Leyers/P. Michiels)

Woke up this morning with my heart on fire
Held on to what I'd been dreaming
Woke up this morning I had one desire
To get back to what I'd been seeing
Heaven, it was heaven
I have never known a bliss
Witnessed anything like this

Glowing all over as I started on my feet
Thought I heard somebody calling
Heaven, it was heaven
Now I know I've seen the light
Make it go on shining

Refrain:
I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Babe make me all the way to your heart
I want you, ooh

All the sweet kisses all the tenderness
That are being shared all around me
Only remind me of my own distress
No loving arms to surround me
Falling, I am falling
You could help me out again
Being mine forever

Refrain: ...

You got it
You got it
There'll be no doubt about it
Nobody's gonna keep me from you
Ooh I want you, I need you
I'll find a way to get through
Nobody's gonna keep me from you

Heaven, it was heaven
Now I know I've seen the light
Make it go on shining

Refrain: ...

I keep on searching for the way to your heart
Try to believe it's getting better
Baby baby baby
I want you
