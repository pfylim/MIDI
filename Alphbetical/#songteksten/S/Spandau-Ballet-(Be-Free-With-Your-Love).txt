SPANDAU BALLET - BE FREE WITH YOUR LOVE

(Words & music: Gary Kemp)

Be free with your love, free with your love
Be free with your love, free with your love

Two young babes in a foreign land
Draw no milk from the dusty sand
Close their eyes from the night so cold
Feel the love in their mothers hold

Two old man on their different shores
Stretch the world with their tug of war
Tension pulls on a tightening cord
Spread your love over Mans discord
Life's your reward
So sing it to your Lord

Be free with your love, free with your love now baby
Be free with your love, free with your love

Science stands on the threshold of life
Man could be cut by a blow of it's knife
Time to live by a new resolution
In the spirit of loves evolution

Two young girls shining in the sun
Feel your pain but they dance for everyone
Beauty lives in their innocent glow
Things so dear should be free to let grow
So let your heart flow
And sing it to your soul

Be free with your love, free with your love now baby
Be free with your love, free with your love

Be free with your love

Two young girls shining in the sun
Feel your pain but they dance for everyone

Be free with your love
