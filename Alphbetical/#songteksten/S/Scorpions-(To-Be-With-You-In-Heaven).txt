Vers 1:
---------------------------------------------------
You can shoot me down you can drag me 'round
girl I'll get you it won't be long.
You can smash my heart you can trash our love
but my desire for you is much too strong.
---------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------
To be with you in heaven
I would go through the darkest hell
in heaven there's no cure for love that kills.
---------------------------------------------------

You can waste my time but you can't change my mind
I won't stop you so just go on.
You can't play your games but it's all in vain.
Cause' my desire for you is much too strong.

Refrain: 2 *
---------------------------------------------------
To be...

Girl I'm on fire
Heaven seems so close tonight
Girl I would die for your love.
