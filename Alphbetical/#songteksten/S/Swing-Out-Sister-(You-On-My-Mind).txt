SWING OUT SISTER - YOU ON MY MIND

(Words & music: Connell/Drewery/O'Duffy)

Friends say I'll get over you soon
Thoughts of you come back to fill me with gloom
Time forgets but I'm not over you yet
There's no sense in asking why
Until the tears run dry

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending, 
That we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)

Years have flown by since you've been gone
This broken heart of mine's been waiting too long
All alone without you I can't carry on
There's no sense in asking why
Until I'm there by your side

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending, 
That we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)

We could plant tomorrow's dream now together
In a garden to last forever more
And the flowers would grow
From the seeds we'd sow ba-bada ba ba
Ba-bada boo-ooh ba-doo-dah
Ba do-da-da-da-da ba-da bada
Bada-da-da-da bada bada-dumda

There's no one but you on my mind
Searching for a perfect ending, 
That we'll never find (we'll never find)
If we could make it work this time (make it work this time)

There's no sense in asking why (always on my mind)
Waiting until the tears run dry (make it work this time)
If I could make you change your mind ( always on my mind)
If I could make it work this time (make it work this time)
There's no sense in asking why (always on my mind)
Waiting until the tears run dry (make it work this time)
If we could make it work this time (always on my mind)
(Make it work this time always on my mind)
(Make it work this time always on my mind)
