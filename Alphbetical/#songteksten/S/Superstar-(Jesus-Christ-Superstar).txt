  11. Superstar - Jesus Christ Superstar
  
  Every time I look at you
  I don't understand
  Why you let the things you did get so out of hand
  You'd have managed better
  If you'd had it planned
  Why did you choose such a backward time
  And such a strange land
  If you'd come today
  You would have reached a whole nation
  Israel in 4BC had no mass communication
  (Don't you get me wrong)
  Now you don't get me wrong
  (Don't you get me wrong now)
  Don't you get me wrong now
  (Don't you get me wrong)
  Don't you get me wrong
  (Don't you get me wrong now)
  Don't you get me wrong now
  (Only want to know)
  Only want to know
  (Only want to know now)
  Only want to know now
  (Only want to know)
  I only want to know
  (Only want to know now)
  I only want to know.
  
  Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
  Who are you?
  What have you sacrificed?
  Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
  Who are you?
  What have you sacrificed?
  Jesus Christ Superstar
  Do you think you're what they say you are?
  Jesus Christ Superstar
  Do you think you're what they say you are?
  
  Tell me what you think about your friends at the top
  Now who'd you think besides yourself's the pick of the crop
  Buddha was he where it's at? Is he where you are
  Could Mahomet move a mountain
  Or was that just P.R.?
  Did you mean to die like that
  Was that just a mistake?
  Or did you think your message
  Would be a record-breaker?
  
  (Don't you get me wrong)
  Now you don't get me wrong
  (Don't you get me wrong now)
  Don't you get me wrong now
  (Don't you get me wrong)
  Don't you get me wrong
  (Don't you get me wrong now)
  Don't you get me wrong now
  (Only want to know)
  Only want to know
  (Only want to know now)
  Only want to know now
  (Only want to know)
  I only want to know
  (Only want to know now)
  I only want to know.
