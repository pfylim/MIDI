Singer : BILLY SWAN 
Title  : EVERYTHING'S THE SAME

You went away and left me
'Cause you thought you could hurt me
But I've got news for you
I'm still strong and you are wrong
To think you'd leave and I'd turn blue

Everything's the same
There ain't nothin' changed
The sun still shines
And the rain still rains
And I'm still me
And you're still you, too, you see

Everything's the same
There ain't nothin' changed
Since you've been gone
I still do what I do
No I haven't changed my habits a bit
I still eat, I still sleep
I still go to work
And when my work day's done I split
