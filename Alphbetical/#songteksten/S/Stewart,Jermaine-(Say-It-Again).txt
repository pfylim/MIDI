JERMAINE STEWART - SAY IT AGAIN

Refrain:
Say it again ooh baby
Please say it one more time for me
I don't believe I heard you right
Did you say you love me?

We've been friends real close friends
For a long time
I can tell there is something heavy
Hanging on your mind
Action speaks louder than words
I was sure you said it right
When you said it last night
I love you

Refrain: ...

Say it again and again and again and again

Sitting here with your heard in a crazy spin
Don't be afraid to let this love affair begin
Hold me tell me what's on your mind
I'll always have the time to hear those words
I love you

Refrain: ...

Hold me tell me what's on your mind
I'll always have the time to hear those words
I love you
