Title  : WINDSURFING TIME AGAIN

(Words & music: J. Eggermont/A. Mol/E. Veerhoff/

Winter, rain and snow have disappeared
There's magic in the air
Have a check on your board, because the time has come
To go to the beach and surf along

Baby this is fun, so won't you have a try
I'm sure you can learn it pretty fast
Maybe you'll be running out for the best
(At the surfin' test)

Chorus:
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Windsurfing time again
(So easy go on, let's try ha ha ha ha)
Windsurfing time again
(The whole summer along, you won't deny)

When surfer-boy meets surfer-girl
We all stick together, singing ooh ooh ooh
Having a party oh la la
What happens then, I won't tell my papa
Ha ha ha windsurfing time again

Surfing afternoon
It's a sunny day as long as the wind blows in my sail
I feel o.k.
And when the girl of your dreams says: I think you're cute
Then your surfing day is really ending good
(And you're in the mood)

Chorus: ...
