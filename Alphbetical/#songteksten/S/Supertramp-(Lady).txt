Lady, you comin' 'cross the water,
well, don't you think you ought a be waiting a while ?
Are you acting on what your heart has told you;
is nothing gonna hold you from flying away ?
Ah ha, flying away, ah ha, flying away.

'Cause there's no where to go, though the road
is out stretching before you.
And the farther you go,
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven,
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven, 
and you know just who you are.
And you know that there's somethin' between us, 
and you like what you feel.
But I can tell that you're not gonna turn back,
well, I can tell that you're not gonna turn back,
and don't you know I'm a little bit sad ?
Oh no.

Oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
ah, ah.

Mister, you better get a move on,
you better get a fix on you better walk straight.
I said, Lady, oh take me if you want me;
won't you take me as you find me ?
Oh, I'm needing your love so bad,
I'm needing your love so bad,
I'm needing your love.
And there's no where to go, though the road
is out stretching before you.
And the farther you go,
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven,
I said ain't nothin' gonna get you to heaven, 
and you know just who you are.
And you know that there's somethin' between us, 
and you like what you feel.
But I can tell that you're not gonna turn back,
well, I can tell that you're not gonna turn back,
and don't you know I'm a little bit sad ?
Oh no.

Oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
ah, ah.

You're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about;
you're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about.
You're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about;
you're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about.
You're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about;
you're takin' the long way, she's turnin' about.
