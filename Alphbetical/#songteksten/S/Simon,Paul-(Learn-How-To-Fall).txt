You got to learn how to fall
before you learn to fly
and mama, mam it ain't no lie
before you learn to fly
learn how to fall.

You got to drift in the breeze
before you set your sails
it's an occupation where the wind prevails
before you set your sails
drift in the breeze.

Oh and it's the same old story
ever since the world began
everybody got the runs for glory
nobody stop and scrutinize the plan
nobody stop and scrutinize the plan.

You got to learn how to fall
before you learn to fly
the tank towns they tell no lie
before you learn to fly
learn how to fall.
