You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
There were rooms of forgiveness
in the house that we share,
but the space has been emptied
of whatever was there.
There were cupboards of patience,
there were shelf loads of care.
But who ever came calling found nobody there.
After today, after today consider me gone.

You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
You can't stay there.
Roses have thorns;
shining water's mud.
Cancer lurks deep in the sweetest bud.
Clouds and eclipses stain the moon and the sun.
And history reeks of the wrongs we have done.
After today, after today consider me gone.

I've been too many years at war with myself,
doctor has told me it's no good for my health.
To search for perfection is all very well.
But to look for heaven is to live here in hell.

Doh dah doh dah doh dah doh dah doh dah after today,
after today, after today, consider me gone.
Consider me gone.
Consider me, consider me,
consider me gone, gone, gone ,gone.
Ah ooh ooh !
Ah ooh ah !
Ah ooh ooh !
