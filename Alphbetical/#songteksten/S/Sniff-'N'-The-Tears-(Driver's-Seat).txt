Title  : DRIVER'S SEAT
Artist : SNIFF'N'THE TEARS

(Words & music: Paul Roberts)

We're doin' alright
A little jiving on a saturday night
Come what may, gonna dance the day away

Jenny was sweet
She always smile for the people she meet
On trouble and strife
She had another way of looking at life

The news is blue
It has its own way to get to you
What can I do?
I'll never remember my time with you
So pick up your feet

Got to move to the trick of the beat
There is no elite
Just take your place in the driver's seat
Driver's seat, driver's seat
