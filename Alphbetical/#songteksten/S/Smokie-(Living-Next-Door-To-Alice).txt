Sally called when she got the word
She said I suppose you've heard - About Alice
Well I rushed to the window
Well I looked outside
As a big limousine rolled up - Into Alice's drive

Don't know why she's leaving or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cos for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice
24 years just waiting for the chance
To tell her how I feel and may be get a second glance
Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice

We grew up together two kids in the park
We carved our initials deep in the bark - Me and Alice
Now she walks through the door with her head help high
A big limousine pulled slowly - Out of Alice's drive

Don't know why she's leaving or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cos for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice
24 years just waiting for the chance
To tell her how I feel and may be get a second glance
Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice

Sally called back and asked how I felt
And she said, hey I know how to help - Get over Alice
She said now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting for 24 years -
And the big limousine disappeared

Don't know why she's leaving or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know
'Cos for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice
24 years just waiting for the chance
To tell her how I feel and may be get a second glance
Now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice
