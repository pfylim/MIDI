Chorus:
Baby can't you see, I wanna talk it over
Baby you and me, we'll find a four leave clover
Baby can't you see, I wanna talk it over
Baby you and me, we'll find a four leave clover
soon

Walkin' through the rain
Feelin' so much better
Wash away the pain
Tryin' to forget her
('Cause you know what she said)

Baby can't you see
We're not good for each other
Baby you and me
Can't play mother and father
I just can't be free
When you're saying what's the matter
Baby you and me
We just cannot be together

Chorus: ...

Walking through the rain
Feelin' that I miss him
(I knew you gonna miss me)
I've got a lot of pain
'Cause I can't be with him
(But you can be with me oh yeah)
One day you will see
You've got to show your emotions
Give your heart to me
We'll love each other with devotion, yeah
Baby now I see, now you see
We are birds of a feather
Baby you and me
We just got to be together

Chorus: ...

Baby now we see
We were meant for each other
Baby you and me
Can play mother and father
Baby now we see
We were meant for each other
Baby you and me
Can play mother and father

Baby now we see
You and me
Now we see we were meant for each other
Baby you and me
Can play mother and father
Now now now we see
You you you and me
Now now now we see
You you you and me
You and me

Together again
I'm so glad I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I've found you yeah
I'm so glad I'm so glad, I'm so glad
I've found you yeah
