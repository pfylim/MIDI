MY WAY - FRANK SINATRA

Intro

1. Strophe:
And now  the end is near 
and so I face  the final curtain.
My friend, I say it clear,
I'll state the case  of which I'm certain
I've lived  a life that's full
I've travelled each and ev'ry highway
And more, much more than this - I did it my way !

2. Strophe:
Regrets  I've had a few
But then again  too few to mention
I did  what I had to do
And saw it through  without examption.
I planned  each chartered course
Each careful step  along the byway
And more, much more than this - I did it my way !

ZwischenstÅck:
Yes, there were times  I'm sure I knew
When I bit off more  than I could chew
But through it all  when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out.
I faced it all and I stood tall - and did it my way !

3. Strophe:
I've loved, I've loved and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all  so amusing.
To think  I did all flat
And may I say, not in a shy way,
Oh no, oh no, not me - I did it my way !

ZwischenstÅck:
For what  is a man  what he has got
If not himself, then he has not
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows  I took the blows - and did it my way !

Yes, it was my way !
