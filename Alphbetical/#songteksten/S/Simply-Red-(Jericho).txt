Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho,
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho and the walls came tumbling down.

Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, Jericho, Jericho,
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho and the walls came tumbling down.

You may talk about yo Kings of Gideon 
you may talk about yo men of Saul,
but there's none like good old 
Joshua at the battle of Jericho.

Right up to de walls of Jericho
he marched with a spear in his hand
"go, blow that ram's horn" Joshua cried,
'cause the battle is in my hand.

Then the lamb, ram, sheep-horns began to blow,
and the trumpets began to sound.
Joshua commanded the children to shoot
and the walls came tumbling down.
