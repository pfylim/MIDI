Title  : Let There Be Love
Singer : Simple Minds


Secrets of lovers whisper tonight
Broken down angel
Got lost in the cold daylight
The city is screaming
And I look for your eyes
Someone to lean on
Through the night
Your music talks to me
And hist me tonight
One candle burning
I hear your voice say
So let there be love
Let there be love, love
Let there be love
It heals and it hurts
She leads you to heaven's door
And leaves you for dirt
Someone to lean on
That's your own
Some magic conquers me
And lives in my soul
She comes like an ocean
And I hear you sing
Love will conquer anything
So let it be love
Let it be love, love
Let it be love
The wall's down
They're coming down
I can't slow I know it now
So stay now, hold on
And I'm praying
So let it be love
So let it be love, love
Let it be love
I know what I want
I know what I feel
I know what I want
So let there be love (2x)
Let there be love
