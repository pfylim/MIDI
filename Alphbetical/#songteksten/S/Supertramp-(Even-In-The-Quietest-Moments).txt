Aah.
Even in the quietest moments I wish I knew
what I had to to,
and even though the sun is shining,
well, I feel the rain, here it comes again, dear.
And even when you showed me
my heart was out of tune
for there's a shadow of doubt 
that's not letting me find you too soon.
The music that you gave me, the language of my soul,
Lord, I wanna be with you, 
won't you let ma come in from the cold ?

Don't you let the sun fade away,
don't you let the sun fade away,
don't you let the sun beleaving 
won't you come to me soon ?

And even though the stars are listening
and the oceans deep,
I just go to sleep.
And then I create the silent movie
you become the star, is that what you are dear ?
Your whisper tells a secret,
your laughter brings me joy,
and a wonder of feeling I'm nature's own little boy.
But still the tears keep falling,
they're raining from the sky.
Well, there's a lot of me got to go
under before I get high.

Don't you let the sun disappear, 
don't you let the sun disappear,
don't you let the sun beleaving, 
no, you can't beleaving my life.

Say that you won't be leaving my life.
Say that you won't be leaving my life.
Say won't you please, say, won't you please.
Say won't you please, say, won't you please.
Lord won't you come and get into my life ?
Lord won't you come and get into my life ?
Say won't you please, say won't you please, 
say won't you please, say won't you please, 
oh. Lord don't go.
And even when the song is over, where have I been,
was it just a dream ?
And though your door is always open,
where do I begin,
may I please come in, dear ?
