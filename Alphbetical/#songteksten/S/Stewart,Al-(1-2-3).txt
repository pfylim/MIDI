                    ONE, TWO, THREE

            One two three

            that's how elementary,  it's going to be

            Just fine and dandy, it's easy

            Like taking candy, from a baby


            Primitive country, rich in minerals you

            Pay them with beads

            Tip the generals, it's easy, like taking candy, from a baby

            
            THE HARD PART IS LEARNING ABOUT IT

            THE HARD PART IS BREAKING THROUGH TO THE TRUTH

            THE HARD PART IS LEARNING TO DOUBT WHAT YOU READ,

            WHAT YOU HEAR, WHAT YOU SEE ON THE NEWS


            Foreign policy, made above my head well,

            No one asked me, they just laughed and said

          [  It's easy (IT'S SO EASY)  like taking candy, from a baby ]2x
           

            ONE TWO THREE    AAAAAAAAAAH 

            ONE TWO THREE    AAAAAAAAAAH 

            tsp

             ONCE THEY GET YOU SUCKED INTO THE SYSTEM

             ONCE THEY GET YOU UNDER CONTROL

             THE HARD PART IS KNOWING HOW TO RESIST

             THE GRIP THAT THEY KEEP ON YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL

             
            So in the end, we just compromise, and pretend

              if you close your eyes

              It's easy (IT'S SO EASY) like taking candy from a baby
