You can't run can't hide i can't leave your side
when your heart is burnin' turn me inside out if you can
love is just the yearnin' searchin' for a caressin' hand
hi hi hi
we need emotion love is incurable i say 
hi hi hi
gimme a sign we might apologize an' we might realize
hi hi hi
we need emotion love is incurable i say
hi hi hi
gimme a sign i can't lie can't fly while we share
thsi style this might be the answer
to the latest question we had runnin' round my mind
it doesn't cease drivin' me mad
hi hi hi.....
