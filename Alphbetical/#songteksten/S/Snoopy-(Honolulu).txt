I know a place next door to paradise
sun and fun is what they advertise
Rum, Coca - Cola, yankee dollar bills
Hawaii is an island that really thrills.

The sunshine ans sweet wine
they gonna make you feel fine
the moonlight and hot night
will make you feel o.k.
dancing, romancing till the morninglight
Honolulu, that's where I wanna go
Honolulu, the place for you and me
Honolulu, that's where I wanna go
Honolulu, the place for you and me.

Can you imagine how it will be
sitting in the shadow of a big palm tree
watching the sea while the ships go by
it's fun on the island of Hawaii.

If you wanna make a dream come true
I will tell what to do
get yourself a ticket where you will fly
to the sunny island of Hawaii.

Honolulu, that's where I wanna go,...
