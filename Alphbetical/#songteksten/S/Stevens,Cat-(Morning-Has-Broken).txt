5. MORNING HAS BROKEN - CAT STEVENS

Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first bird
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world

Sweet the rain's new fall
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dewfall
On the first grass
Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where his feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light Eden saw play
Praise with elation
Praise ev'ry morning
God's recreation of the new day.

Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first bird
Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world
