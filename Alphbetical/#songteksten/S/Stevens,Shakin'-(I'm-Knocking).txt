I know you want to love me
when I knock upon your door,
come over pretty baby,
I'm not saying this for sure,
I know you love me baby,
when I knock upon your door.

I'm knockin' once,
I'm knockin' twice,
I knock three times, baby oh that's nice.
How do you feel baby now i've come close to your door.
Well, you look plum tuckered,
but baby there's more for sure, for sure baby.

I know you want to love me
when I knock upon your door,
come over pretty baby,
I'm not saying this for sure,
I know you love me baby,
when I knock upon your door.

I'm knockin'
I'm knockin'
I'm rockin'
I'm knockin'
