Singer : THE SWEET 
Title  : TEENAGE RAMPAGE

All over the land
The kids are finally starting to get the upper hand
They're out in the streets
They turn the heat
And soon they could be completely in command
Imagine the sensation of teenage occupation
At thirteen they'll be learnin'
But at fourteen they'll be burnin'
But there's something in the air of which we
all will be aware
But they don't care
No no no no so

Come join the revolution
Get yourself a constitution
Come join the revolution now
And recognize your age it's teenage rampage
Turn another page on the teenage rampage now
So recogni your age it's teenage rampage
Turn another page on the teenage rampage now

They're gettin' it on, ain't doin' it wrong
And they're gonna do it, it won't be long
They gotta be heard, they get the world
That really belongs and now they're comin' on strong
Imagine the formation of teenage legislation
At thirteen they were foolin', but at sixteen
they'll be rulin'
And there's something in the air
Of which we all will be aware
But they don't care
No no no no so

Refrain:
But there's something in the air
of which we will be aware
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so
