SPANDAU BALLET - THROUGH THE BARRICADES

(Words & music: Gary Kemp)

Mother doesn't know where love has gone
She says it must be youth
That keeps us feeling strong
See it in her face, that's turned to ice
And when she smiles she shows
The lines of sacrifice

And now I know what they're saying
As our sun begins to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Father made my history
He fought for what he thought
Would set us somehow free
The taught me what to say in school
I learned it off my heart
But now that's torn in two

And now I know what they're saying
In the music of the parade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Born on different sides of life
But we feel the same
And feel all of this strife
So come to me when I'm asleep (asleep)
We'll cross the lines
And dance upon he streets

And now I know what they're saying
As the drums begin to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

Oh, turn around I'll be there
There's a scar right through my heart
But I'll bare it again
Oh, I thought we were the human race
But we were just another borderline case
And the stars reach down and tell us
There's always one escape

Oh I don't know where love has gone
In this troubled land
Desperation keeps us strong
Friday's child is full of soul
With nothing left to lose
There's everything to go

And now I know what they're saying
It's a terrible beauty we've made
So we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades

And now I know what they're saying
As our hearts go to their graves
And we made our love on wasteland
Oh, and through the barricades
