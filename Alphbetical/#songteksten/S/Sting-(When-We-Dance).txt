12. When We Dance - Sting

When we dance

If he loved you/Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town I'd change my name
When he watches you
When he counts to bay your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings
When we dance angels will run and hide their wings
The priest has said my soul's salvation 
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion 
When we dance angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
I'm gonna find a place to live
Give you all I've got to give
I'm gonna love you more than life
If you'll only be my wife...
I'm gonna love you night and day
I'm gonna try in every way
Im gonna find a place to live
If you'll only be my wife
If I could break down these walls and shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands and I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise a way I'd still be saying
I'm still in love ...
He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife
When we dance angels will run and hide their wings...

When we dance
If he loved you/Like 
I love you
