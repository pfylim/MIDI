SURVIVOR - BURNING HEART

Two worlds collide rival nations
It's a primitive clash
Painting years of frustration
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it east versus west or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone

REFRAIN:

In the burning heart
Just about to burst
There's a quest for answers
And a bridge of the past
In the darkest night
Rising like a spire
In the burning heart
The unmistakable fire

In the burning heart

Warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop
His spirit cries never
Deep in our soul a crying bird
Knows it's you against you
It's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us all
It's a matter of wills
In the heat of attack
It's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

REFRAIN: ...(2x)...

In the burning heart
