SISTER SLEDGE - FRANKIE

Hey Frankie
Ooh ooh ooh

I was walking down the street one day
When I looked up I saw a friend
Hey Frankie, do you remember me
You looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remember I loved you so much
Way back when we were friends
Going together but then you left me
Frankie do you remember me
Frankie do you remember

You were fifteen and I was twelve
It was summer we were so in love
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me I'm thrilled to your touch
Hey Frankie do you remember me
Frankie do you remember
Ooh how you brought me down (down down)
All I did was run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you
Frankie do you remember me
Do you remember Frankie

You walked me to the deli then
We sat in the booth were it all began
I looked in your big eyes and
Said to myself we could have had twins if
Frankie do you remember me
Ooh how you brought me down (down down)
All I did was run run around (around)
You'll never know how much I loved you

You looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remember I loved you so much
Way back when we were friends
Going together but then you left me
Frankie do you remember me
Frankie do you remember
Frankie do you remember me
(Do you remember me) me
(Frankie) now Frankie
My baby Frankie (do you remember me)
Frankie do you remember me
Frankie
