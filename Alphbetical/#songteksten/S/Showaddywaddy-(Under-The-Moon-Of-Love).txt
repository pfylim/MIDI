Title  : UNDER THE MOON OF LOVE

(Words & music: Tommy Boyce/Curtis Lee)

Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit down and talk
Under the moon of love
I wanna tell ya that I love ya 
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling
Let's talk, let's walk
Under the moon of love

You look so lovely
Under the moon of love
Eyes shine so brightly
Under the moon of love
Hold me close, hold me tight
And my love tonight
Little darling
Let's walk, let's talk
Under the moon of love

I wanna talk sweet talk
Whisper things in your ears
I wanna tell ya the things
I know, ya been waiting to hear, love
