It's a shiny day and we're on our way
Like a big, big family
And it's a good, good, good, good, vacation for everyone
Well you'll find us there in the sun and salty air
Like a big, big family
And it's a good, good, good, good, vacation with a lot of fun
Uptight out, aside couples on the beach tonight
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah, it's gonna be alright on the beach
There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach
There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach

We gonna, gonna have a party tonight
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach

Singin' tweedle dum with our head in the sun
Like one big family and it's a good, good, good vacation with 
a lot of fun
All you have to do is bring your friends with you
Like a big big family
And it's a good, good, good vacation for everyone

Uptight out, aside couples on the beach tonight
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ah ha, we gonna dance all night on the beach
There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach
There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach

We gonna, gonna have a party tonight
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach
Uptight out, aside couples on the beach tonight
Ah it's gettin' dynamite on the beach

There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach
There are girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, girls on the beach
