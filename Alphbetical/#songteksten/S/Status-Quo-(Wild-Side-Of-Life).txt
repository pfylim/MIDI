Singer : STATUS QUO 
Title  : WILD SIDE OF LIFE

(Words & music: William Warren/Arlio A. Carter)

Well you wouldn't read my letter, if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

Now the glamour of the gay life
Has lured you to the places
Where the wine and liquor flow
Well you went to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you'd ever know

I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh, I might have known
You'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one
Who ever loved you
And went back to the
Wild side of life
