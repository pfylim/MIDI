Well I came by your house the other day
your mother said you went away
she said there was nothing that I could have done.

There was nothing nobody could say
me and you we've known each other ever
since we were sixteen
I wished I would have known
I wished I could have called you
just to say goodbye Bobby Jean.

Now you hung with me when all the
others turned away, turned up their nose
we liked the same music, we liked the
same bands, we liked the same clothes
we told each other that we were the wildest.

the wildest things we'd ever seen
now I wished you would have told me
I wished I could have talked to you
just to say goodbye Bobby Jean.

Now we went walking in the rain talking
about the pain that from the world we hid
now there ain't nobody, nowhere nohow
gonna ever understand me the way you did.

Maybe you'll be out there on that road
somewhere, in some bus or train
traveling along, in some motel room
there'll be a radio playing and you'll hear
me sing this song.

Well, if you do, you'll know I'm thinking
of you and all the miles in between and
I'm just calling one last time
not to change your mind, but just to say I
miss you baby, good luck, goodbye Bobby Jean.
