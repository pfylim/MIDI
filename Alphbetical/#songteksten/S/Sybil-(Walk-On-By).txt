Title  : Walk On By
Singer : Sybil


If you see me walkin' down the street
And I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by

Make believe that you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve in private
'Cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by

I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by

Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye

Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by, don't stop
Walk on by
