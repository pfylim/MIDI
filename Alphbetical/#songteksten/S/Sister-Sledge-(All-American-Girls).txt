     We're all..american girls...and we love..the life that we lead...
     We're all..american girls...hear what we say,..know what we mean...

     We're all..american girls...and we love..the life that we lead...
     We're all..american girls...hear what we say,..know what we mean....

     The day has finally come,...we're reachin' out!..for number one....
     We've worked hard all of our lives...It's a fact...Just to survive...

     .....You'd better get this straight!.....
     Wise up before it's too late!.....
     We're not threatened by your lies..or..your goodbyes!

     We're all..american girls...and we love..the life that we lead...
     We're all..american girls...hear what we say,..know what we mean....

     Sometimes the struggle gets rough...
     You'll give it all!..but..it's not enough!...
     A vacant job at the top,.... 
     Don't let 'em tell you,..that right, you're not!..

     .....We're not asking to reverse.....
     No, so-o lo-ong re-hearsed.....
     Give us an equal share, that's..just fare!

     We're all..american girls...and we love..the life that we lead...
     We're all..american girls...hear what we say,..know what we mean...

     We're all..american girls...and we love..the life that we lead...
     We're all..american girls...hear what we say,..know what we mean....

     BASS SOLO......................All american .........
     ...............................All american gir-irls!
     ...............................All american!

     We're all..american girls (all america--a-an!)...
     and we love (hey!) the life that we lead 
     (wise up before it's too la-ate!) We're all..american girls...
     hear what we say,..an' know what we mean (whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh oh!)

     We're all (yeah!) american girls...
     and we love..the life that we lead...
     'Cause we're all..american girls..
     hear what we say,..and know what we mean..(yeah)
     We're all american.....
