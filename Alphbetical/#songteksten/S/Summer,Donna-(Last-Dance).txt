Title  : LAST DANCE

(Words & music: P. Jabarra)

Last dance, last dance for love
Yes it's my last chance
For romance, tonight

I need you by me
Beside me
To guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so so bad

So let's dance
The last dance
Let's dance
The last dance
Let's dance
The last dance
Tonight

Last dance, last dance for love
Yes it's my last chance
For romance, tonight

Oh, I need you by me
Beside me
To guide me
To hold me
To scold me
'Cause when I'm bad
I'm so so bad

So let's dance
The last dance
Let's dance
The last dance
Let's dance
The last dance

Yeah will you be my Mr. Right
Can you fill my appetite
I can't be sure
That you're the one for me
But all that I ask
Is that you dance with me

Yeah
