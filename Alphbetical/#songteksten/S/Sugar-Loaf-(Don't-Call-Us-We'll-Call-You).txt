Long distance, direct'ry assistance area code 212
Say hey A&R this is mr. Rhythm & Blues
He said, hello, and put me on hold
To say the least the cat was cold
He said, don't call us child, we'll call you

spoken:
I said, you got my number
He said, yeah, I got it when you walked in the door
Don't call us we'll call you
Don't call us we'll call you

I got your name from a friend of a friend
Who said he used to work with you
You remember the all-night creature
From Stereo Ninety Two, yeah
I said, could you rate to our quarter track tape
You know the band performs in the nude
He said, uh-huh, don't call us, child, we'll call you
Listen kid, you paid for the call, you ain't bad
But we've heard it all before

spoken:
Yeah, it sounds like John, Paul and George

Anyway we cut a hit and we toured a bit
With a song he said he couldn't use
And now he calls and begs and crawls
It's a telephone deja vu
We got percentage points and ousy joints
And all the glitter we can use mama
So uh-huh don't call us, now we'll call you

Listen kid, you paid for the call, you ain't bad
But I've heard it all before
Don't call us we'll call you
Don't call us we'll call you
