Title  : THIS OLE HOUSE
Artist : SHAKIN' STEVENS

(Words & music: Stuart Hamblen)

This ole house once knew my children
This ole house once knew my wife
This ole house was home and comfort
As we fought the storms of life
This ole house once rang with laughter
This ole house heard many shouts
Now she trembles in the darkness
When the lightning walks about

Chorus:
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
Ain't gonna need this house no more
Ain't got time to fix the shingles
Ain't got time to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the hinges
Nor to mend no window panes
Ain't gonna need this house no longer
I'm a-gettingready to meet the saints

This ole house is getting shaky
This ole house is a-gettin' old
This ole house lets in the rain
This ole house lets in the cold
On my knees I'm getting chilly
But I feel no fear for pain
'Cause I see an angel peekin'
Through a broken window pane

Chorus: ...

This ole house is afraid of thunder
This ole house is afraid of storms
This ole house just groans and trembles
When the night wind flings its arms
This ole house is a-getting feeble
This ole house is a-needing paint
Just like me it's tuckered out
But I'm getting ready to meet the saints

Chorus: ...

This ole house is a-getting feeble
This ole house I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace
And he'd sit there and howl and grieve
But my huntin' days are over
Ain't gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel done brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door

Chorus: ...
