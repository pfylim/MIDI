Singer : THE TURTLES 
Title  : HAPPY TOGETHER

Imagine me and you I do, I think about you day and night
It's only right to think about the girl you love
And hold her tight, so happy together
If I should call you up invest a dime
And you say you belong to me
And ease my mind, imagine how the world would be
So very fine so happy together

I can see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life
When you're with me baby the skies
Will be blue for all my life
Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice it has to be
The only one for me is you and you for me
So happy together
