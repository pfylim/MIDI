If you take this conversation to the limit
you will feel the warmth of love that is within it
ooh ooh it's not a dream
ooh ooh it's not a dream.

Give me a simple life
fit for a simple man
where I can spend my days being what I am.

I found an angel girl
free from all vanities
she just wants to raise our child
and spend her days with me.

If you take this conversation to the limit
you will feel the warmth of love that is within it.

If you hear what I say when I'm near you
then say what you feel - I can hear you
words pass between us now with such simplicity.

Give me a simple life
fit for a simple man
where I can spend my days being what I am.

Do what you like, like what you do
do all things in love - and love will come to you
take what you need - need what you take
there's only one life - it's the one you make.

Give me a simple life
fit for a simple man
where I can spend my days being what I am.
