10. HOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE - TAKE THAT

And when you rise in the morning sun.
I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain.
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again.
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep you warm in your love
And you softly leave.
And it`s me and me to show

Chorus
How deep is your love.
Is your love.
How deep is your love.
I really need to learn.
`Cause we`re living in a world of fools.
Breaking us down.
When they all should let us be.
We belong to you and me.

I believe in you
You know you`re the door to my bare soul.
You`re the light in my deepest, darkest hour.
You`re my saviour where I fall.
And you may not think I`d care for you
When you note down inside
That I really do.
And it`s me and me to show

Chorus

The other night, the other night

And you may not think I`d care for you
When you note down inside
That I really do.
And it`s me and me to show

Chorus

How deep is your love.
So how deep is your love.
