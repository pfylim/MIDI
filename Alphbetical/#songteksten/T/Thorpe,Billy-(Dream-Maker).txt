So in the light the dance begins
the piper plays his song of love
we cast our dreams into the wind
and mother earth spins on and on.

Her beauty cannot be believed
just can't define the space I'm in
I try to find the door to leave
before my eyes the dream begins.

Dream maker arriving in her ship of light
dream maker princess of the moonlight
caretaker of souls in the dead of night
dream maker spread your golden wings and fly fly.

There in the wind by candlelight
a covenant was made that night 
I pledged my soul the piper played
and to that mystic serenade.

Dream maker arriving in her ship of light
dream maker princess of the moonlight
caretaker of souls in the dead of light
dream maker spread your golden wings and fly fly.
