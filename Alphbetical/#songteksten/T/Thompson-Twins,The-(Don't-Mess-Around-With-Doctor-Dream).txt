THE THOMPSON TWINS - DON'T MESS AROUND WITH DOCTOR DREAM

Don't mess with Doctor Dream
Don't mess with Doctor Dream

Come lay your head down on the stone
So cool the white and welcome home
Oh lose your troubles ease your pain
Soothe your soul in golden rain

Blue marble seas
I will make you feel so good
Roll me over (woh oh oh)
Blue marble dreams
Like you always knew you would
Roll me over

Refrain:
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
He's not one for sympathy
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
He will bring you to your knees

In the house before dawn
You curse the day that you were born
Oh those demons scream in ecstasy
And you crawl round in agony
Doctor jeers and fades away
This is the price that you must pay

Blue marble seas
I will make you feel so good
Roll me over (woh oh oh)
Blue marble dreams
Like you always knew you would
Roll me over

Don't take that take this
Take this

He's not for sympathy
He will bring you to your knees (knees)
Oh loose your troubles ease your pain
This is the price that you must pay

Refrain: ...

Don't mess with Doctor Dream
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
He's not one for sympathy
No no no don't mess with Doctor Dream
Please don't mess with Doctor Dream
Don't mess with Doctor Dream
He will bring you to your knees

Don't take that take this
