 Like to tell you 'bout my baby.
     Y'know she comes around.
     She'bout five feet four,
     a-from her head to the ground.
     Y'know she comes around here,
     a-just about midnight.
     She make me feel so good, Lord.
     She make me feel all right.
     And her name is G-L-O-R-I-A,
     G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A.
     I'm gonna shout it all night. (Gloria)
     I'm gonna shout it ev'ry day. (Gloria)

     She comes around here,
     just about midnight.
     She make me feel so good, Lord.
     I wanna say, she make me feel alright.
     She comes walkin' down my street;
     a-well, she comes to my house.
     She knock up-on my door.
     And then she comes to my room.
     Then she make me feel all right.
     G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A.
     I'm gonna shout it all night. (Gloria)
     I'm gonna shout it ev'ry day. (Gloria)
