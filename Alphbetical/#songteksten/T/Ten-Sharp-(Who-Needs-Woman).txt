She's free in her mind
she's got pride and a fire in her eyes
ooh she knows

Strange, how she looks
she seems a million miles away
she knows what she wants

She's up
she's down
and awake
like almost every night
and I just wait

Eyes open wide lovin' arms in the 
morning light
she smiles a lot
she cries

Who needs women
she'll only take your heart away
who needs women
she'll leave no place to break away

She take's my time
and she always steals my thoughts
I'm a romantic fool

Eyes open wide lovin' arms in the
morning light

She talks a lot
she lies

Who needs women
she'll only take your heart away
who needs women
she'll leave no place to break away

Who needs women

Eyes open wide lovin' arms in the morning light
she talks a lot
she lies

Who needs women
she'll only take your heart away
who needs women
she'll leave no place to break away

Who needs women
Who needs women
you may be right.
