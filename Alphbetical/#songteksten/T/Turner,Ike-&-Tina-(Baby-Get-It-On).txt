Title  : BABY GET IT ON

(Words & music: Ike Turner)

You don't know girl how you blow my mind
I said: now baby, won't you hear what I say
I want your lovin' in the worst darn way
So come on baby, let's get it on

Well, you're the finest girl I ever found in my life
I wanna stick to you like white on white
So come on baby, let's get it on

Now I said: now baby, baby, get it on
You know that I've been waiting too doggone long
So come on baby, let's get it on

Now you don't want me enough for me to turn me on
Come on baby, what you waiting on
Come on baby, baby, baby, get it on

Now you're the finest girl, just as fine as can be
I want ev'ry joy for you and me
So come on baby, let's get it on

Now I said: now baby, baby, get it on
You know that I've been waiting too doggone long
So come on baby, let's get it on
