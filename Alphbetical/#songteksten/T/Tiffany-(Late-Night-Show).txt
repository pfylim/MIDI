12.40 you found it, that's the spot on your
Dial with a smile: the Late Night Show
This is lovable Larry, I'll lay some sides on you
It's gonna give you a kick right through the night
So cuddle up to your radio baby, and we'll do your
Thing together we will

Hi baby
Hear your voice on the radio
I just turned in to hear your show
You know
But I'm all alone
And I'm feeling blue
I'll be staying up to wait for you
For you

The work is hard
And the money is slow
But you've got no other place to go, oh no
But you know you're gonna be big one day
'Cause the people love the songs you play
And what you say

Chorus:
One, two, three, won't you play a song for me
Please mister DJ
Play the music on the radio
Play the music wherever you go
One, two, three, won't you play a song for me
Please mister DJ
Funky music and a lot of soul
Play the music wherever you go
On the Late Night Show

This is lovable Larry, comes down on the
Late Night Show, take care and we'll see
You again soon and sleep good, real good

Hear that you'll be coming on home
That I don't have to be alone
Sleep over day and you work at night
And you thank your job is out of sight
Out of sight

Chorus: ...

Oh, I'm so lonely I think I'll call you right now
Hello, the Late Night Show lovable Larry speaking
Hi, baby, it's me
Hi honey, how you're doing
Hot too good I miss you
You're on the air babe alive on the Late Night Show
I'm gonna play the last record just for you love
I'll be home real soon bye
