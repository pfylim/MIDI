TEARS FOR FEARS - SOWING THE SEEDS OF LOVE

(Words & music: Orzabal/Smith)

High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
D.J.'s the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean
And smash any hope of democracy
As the headline says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues

And anything is possible when you're sowing the seeds of love
Anything is possible, sowing the seeds of love

I spy tears in their eyes
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician Grannie with your high ideals
Have you no idea how the Majority feels?
So without love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a Government plan
Kick out the style Bring back the jam

Anything sowing the seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me in love

Feel the pain
Talk about it
If you're a worried man, then shout about it
Open hearts, feel about it
Open minds, think about it
Everyone, read about it
Everyone, scream about it
Every one
Every one, read about it, read about it
Read it in the books in the crannies
And the nooks there are books to read, chorus

(Mr. England sowing the seeds of love

Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes

High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man
And the lovetrain rides from coast to coast
Every minute of every hour, I love a sunflower
And I believe in lovepower, lovepower, lovepower

Sowing the seeds
And end to need
And the politics of greed
With love
