People of the earth can you hear me ?
Came a voice from the sky that magical night
and in the colours of a thousand sunsets
they travelled to the world on a slivery light.

The people of the earth stood waiting
watching as the ships came on by one
setting fire to the sky as they landed
carrying to the world Children of the sun.

All at once came a sound from the inside
then a beam made of light hit the ground
evryone felt the sound of their heartbeat
every man - every woman - every child.

They passed the limits of imagination
through the doors - to a world - of another time
on the journey of a million lifetimes
with the children of the sun - they started their climb...

No more gravity, nothing holding them down
floating endlessly, as their ship leaves the ground...
thru the walls of time - at the speed of light
fly the crystal ships on their celestial flight
on their celestial flight.
