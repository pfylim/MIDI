  1. BABE (TAKE THAT)
  
  
  I COME TO YOUR DOOR
  TO SEE YOU AGAIN
  BUT WHERE YOU ONCE STOOD
  WAS AN OLD MAN INSTEAD
  I ASKED WHERE YOU'D BE
  HE SAID "SHE'S MOVED ON YOU SEE
  ALL I HAVE IS A NUMBER
  YOU'D BETTER ASK HER NOT ME"
  SO I PICKED UP THE PHONE
  AND DIALED YOUR NUMBER
  NOT SURE TO PUT IT DOWN OR SPEAK
  THEN A VOICE I ONCE KNEW
  ANSWERED IN A SWEET VOICE SHE SAID
  HELLO THEN PAUSED BEFORE I BEGAN TO SPEAK
  
  BABE, I'M HERE AGAIN
  I TELL YOU I'M HERE AGAIN
  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
  BABE, I'M BACK AGAIN
  I TELL YOU I'M BACK AGAIN
  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
  
  YOU HELD YOUR VOICE WELL
  THERE WERE TEARS I COULD TELL
  BUT WHERE WERE YOU NOW?
  WAS YOU GONNA TELL ME IN TIME?
  JUST GIVE ME A TOWN
  AND I'LL BE STRAIGHT DOWN
  I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO TELL YOU
  ABOUT WHERE I HAVE BEEN
  AS I WALK DOWN YOUR ROAD
  CAN'T WAIT TO BE NEAR YOU
  I CAN'T KEEP THIS FEELING INSIDE
  AS I STAND AT YOUR DOOR
  YOU ANSWER IN A SWEET VOICE
  YOU SAY HELLO THEN PAUSE
  BEFORE I BEGIN TO SPEAK
  
  BABE, I'M HERE AGAIN
  I TELL YOU I'M HERE AGAIN
  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
  BABE, I'M BACK AGAIN
  I TELL YOU I'M BACK AGAIN
  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
  
  JUST AS I LOOKED AWAY, I SAW
  A FACE BEHIND YOU
  A LITTLE BOY STOOD AT YOUR DOOR
  AND AS I LOOKED AGAIN I SAW
  HIS FACE SHINING
  HE HAD MY
  EYES, HE HAD MY SMILE
  
  BABE, I'M BACK AGAIN
  I TELL YOU I'M BACK AGAIN
  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
  BABE, PLEASE TAKE ME BACK
  TAKE ME BACK
  BACK HOME AGAIN
  BABE I'M BACK AGAIN
