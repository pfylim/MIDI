 If your heart is filled with love or hate
 
 Find yourself a way to reach out for

 Best things in life, easy to get 

 To find yourself, wasting your time



 Sometimes we all mean to break a rule

 The roots of life,the careless mood you show

 It can be cruel, it can be hard

 Live out your life, show some emotion


 YOU GOTTO LIVE IT UP, LET IT SHOW, TO THE TOP
 YOU GOTTO LIVE IT UP, LET IT SHOW, TO THE TOP
 YOU GOTTO LIVE IT UP, LET IT SHOW, TO THE TOP
 YOU GOTTO LIVE IT UP, LET IT SHOW, TO THE TOP

 Reaching out for love who ain't no crime

 Open your heart, and then you'll find

 Best things in life, it don't come back

 Live out your life, show some emotion
