It's cold outside
and the paint's peeling off of my walls
there's a man outside
in a long coat, grey hat,
smoking a cigarette.
Now the light fades out
and I wonder what I'm doing in a room like this
there's a knock on the door
and just for a second
I thought I remembered you.

So now I'm alone
no I can think for myself
about little deals and S.U.s
and things that I just don't understand
a whire lie at night
or a sly touch at times
I don't think I meant anything to you.

So I open the door
it's the "friend" that I'd left in the hallway
"please sit down"
a candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed.
You know I hate to ask
but are "friends" electric ?
Only mine's broke down
and now I've noone to love.

So I find out your reason
for the phone calls and smiles
and it hurts and I'm lonely
and I shout never have a tried
and I missed you tonight.
It must be time to leave
you see it meant everything to me.
