THE CHALLENGE (FACE IT)

A little luck and the will
To win
Like an eagle
Flies for a ridge so high
You're giving everything for the game
And the moment comes
When the truth will find
A winner in you this time
--------------------------------------------------------
So you wanna be better
Than ever
And you're pushing it right to the line
Knowing it's now or never
'cause the time has come
The time has come
To face it
Now you're ready
To meet the challenge
You're taking it to the top
The ultimate feat,
The challenge
It's a moment away,
You can take it
'cause the time has come to face it
Face it
--------------------------------------------------------
You play your heart
And you grow and grow
Like the final scene from a
Childhood dream
You've come a long way,
You've made the grade
And as you stand alone
Inner strength will
Make a winner of you this time
