Title  : THERE'S A GHOST IN MY HOUSE

There's a ghost in my house
The ghost of your memories
The ghost of the love you took from me
Where our love used to be
Only shadows from the past I see
Time can't seem to erase
The vision of your smiling face
Though you found someone new
I can't get over you

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide from the ghost of your love
That's inside it keeps on haunting me
Just keeps on reminding me

In my mind I know you're gone
But my heart keeps holding on
To the memories of those happy times
To the love that once was mine
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

There's a ghost in my house
I can't hide from the ghost of your love
That's inside you're still a part of me

So deep in the heart of me
I just keep hearing your footsteps on the stairs
When I know there's no-one else there
Ev'ry day I love you more
So much more than the day before
Sitting in my easy chair
I feel your fingers running through my hair
Looking down in my coffee cup
I think I see your face looking up
All alone in my gloom
Your voice echoes through the room

I can't hide from the ghost of your love
That's inside, ev'ryday I love you more
So much more than the day before
I can't hide ...
