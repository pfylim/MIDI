Title  : DON'T LOOK BACK

(Words & music: William Robinson/Robin White)

If it's love that you're running from
There's no hiding place
No so there's problems I know
But they're problems we just have to face
Oh yeah

Chorus:
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

There's something that can be don
Don't end your faith in love
Remembering of what has done

Chorus: ...2x...

If your first lover broke your heart
Something can be done
Don't end your faith in love
Because of what had done

Chorus: ...
