Singer : THREE DEGREES 
Title  : YEAR OF DECISION

Refrain:
Yes this is the year
To make your decision
Yes this is the year
To open up your mind

If you've been holding back
You kind a slack
Now's the time
To get the things you need
There ain't no reason why
You should be shy
People have died, to set you free
Oh, we need - ev'ry one to succeed
Ev'rybody to succeed
Ev'rybody to succeed
We just like, soul isn't enough
So, come on and join us please
Come on and join us please

Refrain: ...

If you're strong enough
To hold the junk
You better make sure
That you leave the bad stuff alone
What ever you wanna do
Thing of the good
'Cause the choice is up to you
Oh, we need - ev'ry one to succeed
Ev'rybody to succeed
Ev'rybody to succeed
Yeah just one, soul isn't enough
Hey, come on and join us please
Come on and join us please

Refrain: ...(2x)...
