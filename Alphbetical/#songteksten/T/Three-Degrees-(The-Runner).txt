Singer : THREE DEGREES 
Title  : THE RUNNER

(Words & music: ...)

How many times have I felt outside
When I need to be loved by you
I wanted to show you how good it could be
If you would only show a little interest in me

Chorus:
But you run, you just won't show love
That's the thing you're frightened of
Oohoo oohoo

You came into my life and turned my head around
And just as quickly you put me down
Now you don't wanna know what I'm going through
It's just like you said, it means nothing to you

Chorus: ...

I've got time, this need eating away at my soul
And insurmountable need that I just can't control
You created this fire when the flame got too hot
You turned and walked away
Just leaving me on the spot

Chorus: ...

There's little hope, but the fool that I am
Still holding on to this dream of a man
The taste of his skin
The gentle touch of his hand
Is worth waiting for, so I must understand

Chorus: ...
