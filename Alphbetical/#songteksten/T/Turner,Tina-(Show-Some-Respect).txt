I made a resolution
and a plan to do my work
but I need you to make it work
you've got to read the message
understand what's on my mind
cause not to see would be a crime
and we could lose it anytime.

We've got to show some respect
we've got to learn to protect
don't take it for granted I know
that if you want to stay close
we've got to show some respect.

But I believe in working
then I believe in a little help
cause I'm not a light unto myself
without a thing of value
why settle for second best
we don't know what's up ahead
we can't let ourselfes forget.

For the things that I love about you
from the woman that you see inside
don't let the walk out the door
love follows every time.

We've got to show some respect
we've got to learn to protect
don't take it for granted I know
that if you want to stay close
we've got to show some respect.
