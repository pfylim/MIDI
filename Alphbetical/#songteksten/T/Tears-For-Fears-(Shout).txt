TEARS FOR FEARS - SHOUT

Refrain:
Shout, shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on

Refrain: ...

In violent times you shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white they really really ought to know
Those one-track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them goodbye you shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy

Refrain: ...

They gave you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice
I hope we live to tell the tale (2x)

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Shout, shout let it all out (let it all out)
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart (2x)

Refrain: ...
