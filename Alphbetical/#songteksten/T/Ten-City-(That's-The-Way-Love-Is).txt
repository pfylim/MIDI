TEN CITY -THAT'S THE WAY LOVE IS

Love la-love
La-love la-love la-love
Love la-love la-love
La-love la-love love love

Oh oh oh oh oh ooh
Hey hey yeah woh oh oh

Two people that have vowed to be together
And live and love each other forever
They promise to love a lifetime
A funny thing then they change their minds
They both go their separate ways
And love is just a memory
But a young heart doesn't stay sad long
Another love soon comes along

refrain:
And that's the way love is
And that's the way love is
And that's the way love is

Two people don't get along deep down in though
That feeling's very strong
They try hard to conceal it
Their hearts burn but they both know they can feel it

refrain: ...

Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
oh woh
Woh oh woh oh

Love la-love
La-love la-love la-love
Love la-love la-love
La-love love love

(Ah oh oh ah)(ah oh oh ah)
(That's the way love is)
