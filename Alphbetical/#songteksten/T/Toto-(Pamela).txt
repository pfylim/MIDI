TOTO - PAMELA

(Words & music: David Paich/Joseph Williams)

Side by side I'll be yours forever
Rain or shine any kind of weather
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
Let's take what's getting old and make it new

Refrain:
Pamela don't break this heart of mine
Just remember it may not heal this time
Pamela there is no second chance
For the one who leaves it all behind
Yeah yeah

Oh Pamela thousands of miles away
But always in my heart
Eye to eye it's a blinding confrontation
You and I we're deadly combination
Well don't start mixing truth with jealousy
The road we're on is clear as far as I can see

Refrain: ...

Black and white always go together
Day and night you're the precious jewel I treasure
Wanting ev'ry part of you is not a crime
Could it be that you're the one who's wrong this time
