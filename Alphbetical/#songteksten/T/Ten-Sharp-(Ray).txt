It is always great to hear
blues man Ray singing
the way that he cries out his soul
always more than music

Piano sings the chords so easy
and Ray

His vocal help the blues survive
who will forget "Georgia on my mind"
for me the greatest voice alive
that is black man Ray

Piano sings the chords so easy
and Ray plays anything
Piano sings the chords so easy

and Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'

He has a heart that's big enough
to hold all the people
this music a reflection of
what is on his mind

Piano sings the chords so easy

and Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'

Piano sings the chords so easy
and Ray 
Piano sings the chords so easy
and Ray 
 
Piano sings the chords so easy

and Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'
Ray keeps on groovin'
