Title  : Under The Boardwalk
Singer : Tom Tom Club


When the sun beats down
And melts the tar upon the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket with my boyfriend's where I'll be

Chorus:
Under the boardwalk, out of the sun
Under the boardwalk, havin' some fun
Under the boardwalk, people walkin' above
Under the boardwalk, we'll be makin' love
Under the boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of the carrousel
And you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell
Under the boardwalk, down by the sea
On a blanket, with my boyfriend's where I'll be

Chorus


Words & Music : Kenny Young, Artie Resnick
