TALKING HEADS - THE LADY DON'T MIND

Last time she jumped out the window
Well she only turned and smiled
You might think she would say something
But you'd have to wait a while

Well the lady don't mind
No no no the lady don't mind

Little boat that floats on a river
It's drifting through a haze
She stops by whenever she wants to
Well there she goes again

Well it's trouble at all
No no no trouble at all
Well what she does is all right with me
And I kinda like that style

Come on, come on
I go up and down
I like this curious feeling
I know I see
It's like make believe
Cover you ears so you can hear what I'm saying
I'm not lost
But I don't know where I am
I got a question
All right, all right
This is what we like
Who knows, who knows
What I'm thinking

She says love is not what she's after
But everybody knows
Each time she looks in the mirror
She lets her feeling show

Well the lady don't mind
No no no the lady don't mind
Well what she says is all right with me
And I like that style

Uh-oh, uh-oh
Here we go again
I don't know
I don't know what I'm saying
Hey man, hey man
I sure don't feel the same
She likes to say what she's feeling
