12. WATERFALLS - TLC

A lonely mother gazing out of a window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam
She'll be by his side
But he doesn't realise he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money
The best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me.
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can handle
But all he can say is, 'Baby is good to me'
And then he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognise his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place.
Don't go chasing waterfalls

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to (that you're used to)
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast.
Don't go chasing waterfalls (Strophe 3x)
