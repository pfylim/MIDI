2. CHINA IN YOUR HAND - T'PAU

Intro
 
1 .Strophe:
It was a theme she had  on a scheme he had
told in a foreign land.
To take a life on earth  to the second birth
and the man was in command.
It was a flight on the wings  of a young girls dream
That flew too far away-ay-ay 
And we could make the monster live again.
Oh hands move and heart beat on
Now life will return  in this electric storm
A prophecy for a fantasy  the curse of a vivid mi-i-ind -

Refrain:
Don't push too far your dreams  are china in your hand
Don't wish to hard because  they may come true
And you can't help them -
You don't know what you might  have set upon yourself
China in your hand.

Instrumental

2. Strophe:
Come from greed  never born of the seed
Took life from a barren hand.
Oh, eyes wide,  like a child in the form of man
A story told  a mind of his own
An omen for our ti-i-ime -

Refrain:
Don't push too far your dreams  are china in your hand ....

On your hand, your dreams are china in your hand, o-o-o-o-oh
here in your - ha-a-and, china in your hand, wo-how-how-how
here in your hand.
 
Saxophon-Solo

3. Strophe:
Oh - you take a flight  on the wings of fantasy
Then you push too far   and make your dreams reality, yeah-eah, yeah!
Oh, china in your hand  (Saxophon/Guitar) oh, china pushed to far
You take a flight  on the wings of fantasy
Then you push too far   and make your dreams reality, yeah-eah, yeah!
Oh, china in your hand
