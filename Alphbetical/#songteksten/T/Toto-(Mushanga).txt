TOTO - MUSHANGA

(Words & music: David Paich/Jeff Porcaro)

I can't forget you, my little Mushanga
I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waiting they keep getting longer
Not a thing I can do, I was a poet
A magazine writer
Sen to report on political Views
It was by chance
Through a lens that I met you
A Kingston girl with no shoes
You were running down the road
I was coming your way
You stopped and turned around
And held out your hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke into my heart
Now all my tears belong to you
Mushanga oh
Mushanga oh
I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that
Came from their mountains
The loss of lives mining white man's gold
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where my stories are bought and sold
I know subscribers would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told
You were running down the road
I was coming your way you stopped and turned around
And held out your hand
You smiled thou you were suffering
I didn't understand
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke into my heart
Now all my tears belong to you
Mushanga oh
Mushanga oh
It's been so long since I last heard your laughter
So many letters but still no news
I hope you find all things that you were after
You know my heart is with you
