TINA TURNER - THE BEST

(Words & music: M. Chapman/H. Knight)

I call you when I need you
And my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me
Wild and wired
You come to me, give me everything I need

You bring a lifetime of promises
And a world of dreams
You speak the language of love
Like you know what I means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong

Refrain:
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

Deep in your heart
I see the start
Of every night and every day
And in your eyes I get lost
I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place

Refrain: ...

Each time you leave me I start losing control
You're walking away with my heart and my soul
But I can feel you even when I'm alone
Baby, baby, don't let go

(guitar solo)
