THOMPSON TWINS - DOCTOR, DOCTOR

I saw you there
Just standing there
And I thought I was only dreaming, yeah
I kissed you then
Then once again
You said you would come and dance with me
Dance with me
Across the sea
And we could feel the motion of a
thousand dreams

Refrain:
Can't you see I'm burning, burning
Oh, doctor, doctor
Is this love I'm feeling?

Ships at night
Give such delight
We all leave before the morning light
Please, don't go
No, please don't go
'Cos I don't want to stay here on my own

Oh oh oh oh

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Fever, breathe your love on me
Take away my name
Fever, lay your hands on me
Never be the same

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Come with me and make believe
We can travel to eternity
