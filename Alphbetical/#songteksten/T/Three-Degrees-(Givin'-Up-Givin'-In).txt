Singer : THREE DEGREES 
Title  : GIVIN' UP, GIVIN' IN

(Words & music: G. Moroder/P.Bellotte)

Givin' up, givin' in
I won't be no fool again
I'm givin' up
I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now

I'm givin' up, givin' in
You can sweet talk to the wind
'Cause I'm givin' up

I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up
I'm givin' up
I'm givin' up now

Too much giving
Just don't take
Guess I saw it all too late
I'm givin' up
I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now

All those lies
And alibi's
That you smooth out
Every time
Now I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now
I'm givin' up now

Givin' up
I was believing
Givin' up
All your deceiving
Givin' up
Always excusing
Givin' up
All an illusion
Givin' up
Always expecting
Givin' up
No longer a deep thing
Givin' up
To many answers
Givin' up
All of them stupid

I'm givin' in
I'm givin' in
'Cause this old heart
Ain't gonna fool my head
Now I'm givin' up
Now I'm givin' up
Now I'm givin' up
Now I'm givin' up
Now I'm givin' up
