Title  : HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABY

(Words & music: B. Mason/R. Greenaway)

There's a special day for everyone
That comes but once a year
And for you my love
That day of days is here

Chorus:
So have a happy birthday, baby
May all your dreams come true
The way mine have with you

This special day, I'd like to say
I wish you every happiness
I hope you're feeling fine
Now you'll have a real good time
And I wish you happy birthday, baby mine

I don't know what I'd do if ever I lost you
I'd have no today, no tomorrow
You've made a simple Joe more happy than you know
And today I want you to say: I love you so

(You've made a simple girl the queen of all the world)
I'll take you to a show and when it's time to go
We'll tell the cab to drive us home real slow

So have a, so have a (happy birthday, baby)
I wish you happy birthday, baby mine
(Happy birthday, baby)
Happy birthday, baby mine (2x)
