Title  : UPSIDE DOWN

(Words & music: K. Versteeg)

Hear the music all around you
When the sound of violins found you
Don't evade this sweet temptation
To be happy and be free
When you're running from the bad times
From these crazy lazy mad times
When you are searching for an answer
Keep remembering this song
Listen to a song of freedom
To a sweet romantic song
Come on let's make a song together
Clap your hands and sing along

Refrain:
Now let's bring the world together
Turn it upside down
This will make you feel much better
Turn it upside down
We will live in harmony
We'll be as happy as can be
Some come together turn it upside down
Together we can make it
Come together turn it upside down

In these days of no illusion
We are singing the solution
Now get rid of your confusion
And believe in harmony

When you're running from the bad times
From the crazy lazy mad times
When you are searching for an answer
Keep remembering this song
Listen to a sound of freedom
To a sweet romantic song
Come on let's make a song together
Clap your hands and sing along

Refrain: ...
