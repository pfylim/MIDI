BACK FOR GOOD - TAKE THAT


I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still
On your coffee cup 
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it
Gotta leave it all behind me.

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood.

Unaware but underlined
I figure out this story
It wasn't good
Yet in the corner of my mind
I celebrate glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation
You excelled to being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me.

Chorus:
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood.

And we'll be together, this time forever
We'll be fighting yes forever we will be
So complete in your love
We will never be uncovered again.

Chorus:
Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood.
