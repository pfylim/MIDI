Well the men come in these places,
and the men are all the same.
You don't look at their faces,
and you don't ask their names.
You don't think of them as human,
You don't think of them at all.
You keep your mind on the money,
keeping your eyes on the wall.

I'm your privat dancer, a dancer for money, 
I'll do what you want me to do,
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, 
and any old music will do.

I wanna make a million dollars,
I want to live out by the sea,
have a husband and some children,
yeah, I guess I wanna family.
All the men come in these places,
and the men are all the same.
You don't look at their faces,
and you don't ask their names.

I'm your privat dancer, a dancer for money, 
I'll do what you want me to do,
I'm your private dancer, a dancer for money, 
and any old music will do.
I'm your privat dancer, a dancer for money, 
I'll do what you want me to do,
Just a private dancer, a dancer for money, 
and any old music will do.
I'm your privat dancer, a dancer for money, 
I'll do what you want me to do,
Just a private dancer, a dancer for money, 
and any old music will do.

Deutschmarks or Dollars,
american Express will do nicely thank you.
Let me loosen up your collar, tell me,
do you wanna see me do the shimmy again ?
