Snow is falling down, just like it always did
world is all in white, there seems no difference at all

Crazy globe of ours, she has another face
what is white a change, it's just like
endless peace (endless peace)

Nature's mystery, it's like an endless dream
nothing can disturb, the come and going (going)

Yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
takin' it down

World is all in white, there seems no difference 
what is white a change, it's just like endless peace

Yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
takin' it down

Yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams

Yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
rong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
yes it's wrong, to think it's gone
and it's all a matter of dreams
