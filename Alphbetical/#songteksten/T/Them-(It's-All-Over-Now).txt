13. IT`S ALL OVER NOW BABY BLUE - THEM

You must leave now, pick what you need.
Your thing will last.
But what ever you wish to keep you better grap it fast.
He understands you`re an orphan with his gun.
Crying like a fire in the sun.
Look out babe, the same song coming through.
And it`s all over now baby blue.
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty handed painter from your streets.
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
The sky, too has fallen in over you.
And it`s all over now baby blue.    
Leave your stepping stones behind.
There`s something that calls for you.
Forget the dirty raf that will not follow you.
Your lover who has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too is old and over you.
And it`s all over now baby blue.    
While striking out the matts, yeah.
Both start anew, both start anew.
`Cause it`s all over now baby blue.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It`s all over, it`s all over now baby blue.    
It`s all, it`s all over now oh yeah.
All over now, all over now, baby blue.
