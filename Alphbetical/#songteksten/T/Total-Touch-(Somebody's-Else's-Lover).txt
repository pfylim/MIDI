    I WILL NEVER DEDICATE MY LOVE, TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LOVER

    JUST DIDN'T WANNA HEAR YOUR LIES, BUT FIRST I HAD TO DISCOVER

    I FORGOT TO LOOK IN YOUR EYES, AND NOW I HAVE TO SUFFER

    NO I WILL NEVER EVER FALL IN LOVE, WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S LOVER


    Somebody help me, somebody teach me

    Somebody tell me what to do, how should I handle you

    I may be heartless, feels so indurious

    I've given the matter due consideration and know for sure that


    I WILL NEVER DEDICATE MY LOVE, TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S LOVER

    JUST DIDN'T WANNA HEAR YOUR LIES, BUT FIRST I HAD TO DISCOVER

    I FORGOT TO LOOK IN YOUR EYES, AND NOW I HAVE TO SUFFER

    NO I WILL NEVER EVER FALL IN LOVE, WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S LOVER

 
    Why did you deceive me, you say you didn't want to hurt me

    But why then did you hold me tight,you knew it would break me

    Why is it that I've chosen-the-wrong-way, which then brought me to you

    But now that I've been there, I should have known better

    I will never never give my soul, to somebody else's lover

    How could I believe it falling for your lies

    I know for sure that I will look into your eyes, more than a moment

    I will ignore my deepest feelings inside,....no I will
