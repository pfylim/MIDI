Title  : HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING AN ANGEL

(Words & music: Freddy Perren)

Heaven must be missing an angel
Missing an angel child for sure
Here with me right now
You know this happened to me
Baby happening to me, baby

Your kiss, ah, is filled with happiness
I want all I can get
Off your sexy lips
Showers, your love comes to showers
And every hour of the hour
You let me feel your love in my world

There's a rainbow over my shoulders
When you came my love's running over
You gave me your heavenly love
And if one night you hear crying from above

Heaven must be missing an angel
Missing an angel child for sure
Here with me right now
You know this happened to me
Baby happening to me, baby

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
