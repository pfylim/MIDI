TOTO - STOP LOVING YOU

Reflections in my mind, thought I can't define
My heart is racing and the night goes on
I can almost hear a laugh, coming from your photograph
It's funny how a look can share a thousand meanings

Well intended lies contemplating alibies
Is it really you or is it me I'm blaming
A distant memory flashes over me
Even though you're gone I feel you deep inside

Dance beneath the light
With that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through
Loving you, girl

There's a window in a heart
I've tried to look through from the start
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking
Someone's broken something new
Another altered point of view
Just a certain someone's conscience playing

I held it in my hand
I did not understand
What lives inside the wind that cries her name
Trying to catch a shooting star
What seems so close can't be that far
I'm living in a dream that's never-ending

Dancing beneath the light
With that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through
Loving you, girl

Dancing beneath the light
With that look in your eyes

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through
Loving you, girl

I can't stop loving you
Time passes quickly and chances are few
I won't stop till I'm through
Loving you, girl
