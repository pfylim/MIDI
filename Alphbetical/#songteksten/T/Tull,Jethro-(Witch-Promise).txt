5. WITCH`S PROMISE - JETHRO TULL

Lend me your ear
While I call you a fool.
You were kissed by a witch
One night in the wood,
And later insisted
Your feelings were true.
The witch's promise was coming,
Believing he listened
While laughing you flew.

Leaves falling red, yellow, brown,
All are the same,
And the love you have found
Lay outside in the rain.
Washed clean by the water
But nursing its pain.
The witches promise was coming,
And you're looking
Elsewhere for your own selfish gain.

Keep looking, keep looking
For somewhere to be,
Well, you're wasting your time,
They're not stupid like he is.
Meanwhile leaves are still falling,
You're too blind to see.

You won't find it easy now,
It's only fair.
He was willing to give to you,
You didn't care.
You're waiting for more
But you've already had your share.
The witches promise is turning,
So don't you wait up
For him, he's going to be late.
