We'll get some overhead lifters
And four barrel quards, oh yeah
A fuel injection cut off
And chrome plated rods, oh yeah
With a four-speed on the floor
They'll be waitin' at the door
You know that ain't no shit
We'll be gettin' lots of tit in
Greased Lightnin'

Chorus:
Go, Greased Lightnin'
You're burnin' up the quarter mile
Go, Greased Lightnin'
You're coastin' through the heat lap trail

The chicks'll scream for Greased Lightnin'

We'll get some purple French tail lights
And thirty inch fins, oh yeah
A Palomino dashboard
And dual muffler twins, oh yeah
With new pistons, plugs and shocks
I can get off my rocks
You know that ain't braggin'
She's a real pussy wagon

Chorus: ...
