THOMPSON TWINS - YOU TAKE ME UP

I work on the front line I work to survive
And I sleep in a fever so this is my life
I cry in my sleep (cry boy cry boy)
It just makes me weep
When I try how I try I know what it means
To work hard on machines it's labor of love
So please don't ask me why

I'm looking for a reason (day in day out)
I'm trying too hard (he's trying too hard)
Moving in circles (too hot too hot)
Don't get very far (don't get very far)
Should I ask you to dance (dance boy dance boy)
If I promise romance
Will you come for the ride
I know what it means to work hard on machines
Do you believe in love one that lasts for all time

Refrain:
You take me up oh oh
You take me up to the higher grounds
You take me up so high
Now I never want you to come back down

I'm glad in these hard times (day in day out)
There's hope in your eyes (hope in his eyes)
I don't need a religion (too hot too hot)
This love never dies (love never dies)
I believe in today (believe boy believe boy)
It's better that way
And you work through the night
I know what it means
To work hard on machines
It's a labor of love
So please don't ask me why

Refrain: ...

I cry in my sleep (cry boy cry boy
It just makes me weep
When I try how I try
I know what it means
To work hard on machines
It's a labor of love
So please don't ask me why
