Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : DEAR JOHN

(Words & music: A. Rifi/G. Shelter)

Dear John, I write you this letter
Oh please, won't you teach me to dance
Dear John, the sooner the better
Oh please, won't you give me a chance

Chorus:
There is a show at the new disco
Where I wanna go, the lights are low
While we can show
All the tricks we know

When we're dancing, disco dancing
When we're dancing, we dream away

Spoken:
John Travolta, won't you teach me to dance
John Travolta, won't you give me a chance
Dear John, won't you listen
Oh please, won't you drop me a line
Dear John, you know what I'm missing
Oh please, give me a sign

Chorus: ...
