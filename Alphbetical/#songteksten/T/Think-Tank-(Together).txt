  People try to desert you ,

  You're not the same, have a strange name, these people

  Please, try to behave you, when they are cruel,acting like fools

  THERE ARE TIMES FOR COMING, THERE ARE TIMES TO GO

  THERE ARE TIMES FOR ASKING AND THERE ARE TIMES FOR PLAY

  THERE ARE TIMES FOR MAKING ,THERE ARE TIMES FOR PRAY
