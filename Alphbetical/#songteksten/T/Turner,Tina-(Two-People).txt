TWO PEOPLE - TINA TURNER

Two people living on the edge of life.
Are people running out of dreams and time.
I can hear it when you tell me so.
I can fell it but I can`t let go.

Chorus: Two people got to stick together.
And love one another, save it for a rainy day.
Some people got to stay whatever,
And give one another shelter on a rainy day.

Two people living in the way we do.
Are people trying to keep a love anew.
What to do to make some sense of it.
What to do to make the feeling fit.

Chorus

I`ll come running to your rescue. 
You gotta stand by me.
There`s a lot of love between us.
We should never let go. Mm

Chorus

Love one another, save it for a rainy day.
One another. Shelter on a rainy day.
Love on a rainy day.
Whatever. One another. Shelter on a rainy day.
Stick together. One another. Save it for a rainy day.
