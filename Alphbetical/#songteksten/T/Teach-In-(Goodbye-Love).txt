Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : GOODBYE LOVE

Refrain:
Now the cloudy days go by
The time has come to say goodbye
Goodbye love, I'm going, goodbye my love
There won't be some more times to spend
This love-song needs a happy-end
Goodbye love, I'm going, goodbye my love
Goodbye love

Got the stars to show the way across the foreign land
Need our music-instruments 'cause we're a jolly band
We know the bad times, with no one there to see you
With no one there to hear you, with anything but happiness
We know the good times, with ev'ry one around you
But now, the day I found you, I've got to go away

Refrain: ...

Now the stars have shown the way to glory and success
So we play our instruments and join our happiness
We've known the bad times, when no one came to see us
The time you didn't hear us, I'm glad to say
They're gone gone gone
And in these good times, we've got to join the nation
But after this sensation, I'm coming back to you

Refrain: ...

The time has come to say goodbye
I'm sorry love
I've got to say goodbye love
