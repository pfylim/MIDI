Was a good friend of mine
I never understood a single word he said......
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
If I were the King of the world
Tell what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars....
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls, now
Joy to fishes in the deep blue sea
Joy to you and me
