
              I don`t wanna loose you             Tina Turner                         


Oh...oh...oh...

Women of a certain age,they learn to rely 
and judge all his responses
having played the mating-game,
she doesn't waste time, 'cause, all that she wants is
real and honest emotions, wanting, can't help but show it
though I hardly know your name,
well I know about love and I know.

I don't wanna lose you, I don't even wanna, say goodbye, oh no.
I just wanna hold on to this, true love, true love.

Women who have made mistakes.
are a little afraid, they don't like taking chances,
she will play the waiting game,
an' she's never impressed, by those manly advances

I know, I've only just met you, maybe I should know better
but when you look at me that way-ay, 
oh there's something inside, that's so right.

I don't wanna lose you, I don't even wanna, say goodbye, oh no.
I just wanna hold on to this, true love, true love.
I don't wanna lose you,...an' I'll always wanna, feel this way oh yeah.
'cause ev'ry time I'm with you,
I feel, true love, true love, true love.

Tell me you're real, you're not pretending,
let's make a deal, 'cause my heart's depending on you, oh baby.

Sax Solo

I don't wanna lose you, I don't even wanna, say goodbye, oh no.
I just wanna hold on, to this, true love, true love, oh.
don't wanna lose you, an' I'll always wanna, feel this way, oh yeah.
'cause every time I'm with you, I feel, true love, true love.

I don't wanna lose you, I don't even wanna, say goodbye, oh no.
I just wanna hold on to this, true love, true love.
I don't wanna lose you, and I'll always wanna feeeeel. 
this way, 'cause ev'ry time I'm with you, I feel, true love,
true love, true love...
