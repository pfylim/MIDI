Singer : PETER TOSH 
Title  : BUK-IN-HAMM PALACE

(Words & music: Peter Tosh)

Disco music, reggae music
As far as I can see
I say, disco music, reggae music
It's got a spell on me

Disco music, rasta music
As far as I can see
Disco music, roots music
It's got a hold on me

It cam make you feel so happy
Whenever problems get you down
It has artificial respiration
Keep you heart functioning sound, so sound

Chorus:
Light you splif, light your chalice
Then we'll smoke it in Buk-in-hamm Palace
Lend me a paper, lend me a fire
We have to chase way from fire

Music and herb is a healing combination
Sent for Jah whom we praise, yeah
So take heed, heed, and listen, and listen
Do you fend for better days, better days c'mon

Chorus: ...

This is a true emancipation
Come to set my people free
Don't let disco get you down

Keep on listening to reggae sounds
C'mon, c'mon light up your splif
Light up your chalice
Rasta don't keep Malice
Light up your spliff
Light up your chalice
In Buk-in-hamm Palace
