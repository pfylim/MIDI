Title  : AIN'T GONNA BUMP NO MORE

(Words & music: Bennie Lee McGinty/Buddy Killen)

Three nights ago, I was at a disco
Man, I's born to bump
I was rarin' to go
And this big fat woman
Bumped me on the floor
She was rarin' to go
That chick was rarin' to go
Man, she did a dip
Almost broke my hip
She was gettin' down
She wanted to bump some more
But I told her
No, you done knocked me down once
You done knocked me down once
I said, If you wanta dance
Find you a big fat man
Y'all go on and get on down
Y'all go on and get on down

Refrain:
I ain't gonna bump no more, with no big fat woman (13x)

Somebody take her
She's too big for me
She done knocked me down
She came over to me
Snatched me outa my seat
She wanted to get on down
I told her to go on and leave me alone
I ain't gettin' down
You done hurt my hip once
I know what you'll do
I ain't gonna bump with you
I don't feel like gettin' down
She just shook her head
At every word I said
She wanted to get on down
That woman want to get on down
She did that hip again
She was gettin' down, Lord
That woman was gettin' down

Refrain: ...

Take her, I don't want her
She done hurt my hip
She done knocked me down
Done hurt my hip
She done knocked me down
