Title  : IT'S A HEARTACHE

(Words & music: Scott/Wolfe)

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Loving till your arms break
Then he'll let you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depending on you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
