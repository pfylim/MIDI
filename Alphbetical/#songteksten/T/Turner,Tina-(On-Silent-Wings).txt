1. ON SILENT WINGS - TINA TURNER

There was a time 
When I would have followed you
To the end of the earth.
I was willing to  share it all with you 
The love the hurt.

I`ve seen you when your dreams
Where falling in the dust.
But I never stop  believing in you.
I always thought our love 
Was strong enough
One you could hold onto to.

You never see it coming 
You just let it by.
On silent wings silent wings.
You can`t have what you feel inside.
And the fire has left your eyes.
Silent wings.

I see us in our dreams
And we`re dancing. 
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers they go unanswered.
Between you and me
All is just a memory.

You never see it coming 
You just go separate ways.
On silent wings silent wings.
There`s no more promises to break.
Oh our love has slipt away.
On silent wings

You never see it coming 
But you know it has to end.
On silent wings silent wings.
I will never be the same again. 
I feel the whisper of the wind. 
On silent wings. Oh.
On silent wings. Uh.
On silent wings.
On silent wings silent wings.
