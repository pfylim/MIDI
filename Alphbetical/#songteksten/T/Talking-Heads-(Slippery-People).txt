Title  : Slippery People
Singer : Talking Heads


What about the time you were rolling over
Fall on your face
You must be having fun walk lightly
Think of a time
You'd best believe this thing is real

Put away that fun
This part is simple
Try to recognize what's in your mind
God help us, help us loose our minds
These slippery people

Chorus:
Help us understand what's the matter with him
(He's alright) I see his face
(The Lord won't mind) Don't play no games
(He's alright) Love from the bottom
To the top turn like a wheel
(He's alright) See for yourself
(The Lord won't mind) We're gonna now
(Right now) Turn like a wheel 
Inside a wheel

I remember when sitting in the tub
Pulled out the plug
The water was running out
Cool down, stop acting crazy
They're gonna leave
And we'll be on our own

Seven times five, they were living creatures
Watch them come to life right before your eyes
Backsliding, how do you do
These slippery people gonna see you through
