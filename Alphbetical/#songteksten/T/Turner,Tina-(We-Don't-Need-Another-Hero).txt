TINA TURNER - WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER HERO

Out of the ruins out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistakes this time
We are the children the last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever going to change
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunder dome

Looking for something we can rely on
There's gotta be something better out here
Love and compassion their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air
And I wonder when we are ever going to change
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

All the children say we don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunder dome

So what do we do with our lives
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Is it all or nothing

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunder dome

All the children say we don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunder dome
