(Words & music: W. Casey/J. Jacobs)

John: Summer lovin' had me a blast
Olivia: Summer lovin' happened so fast
John: I met a girl, crazy for me
Olivia: Met a boy, cute as can be

Summer days, driftin' away to
Oh, those summer nights
A well, a well, a well, a hu
Tell me more, tell me more
Did you get very far?
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car?

J: She swam by me, she's got a cramp
O: He ran by me, got my suit damp
J: I saved her life, she nearly drowned
O: He showed off, splashing around

Summer sun, something's begun
But oh, ah, those summer nights
Well, a well, a well, a hu
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?

J: Took her bowling in the arcade
O: We went strolling, drank lemonade
J: We made out under the dock
O: We stayed out till ten o'clock

Summer fling, don't mean a thing
But, uh, oh those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't got to brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag

Shu-da bop bop (7x)

O: He got friendly, holding my hand
J: She got friendly, down in the sand
O: He was sweet, just turned eighteen
J: She was good, you know what I mean

Summer heat, boy and girl meet
But uh, oh those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

O: It turned colder, that's where it ends
J: So I told her we'd still be friends
O: Then we made our true love vow
J: Wonder what she's doing now

Summer dreams, ripped at the seams
But oh, those summer nights
Tell me more, tell me more
