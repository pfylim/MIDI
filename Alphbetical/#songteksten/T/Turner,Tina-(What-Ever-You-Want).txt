6. WHATEVER YOU WANT - TINA TURNER

Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you.
Whatever you want me to be 
I will be what you need.
Because it`s love that I feel.
Whenever you`re really near
I'm feeling sensual.
I can`t rely on myself.
I'm wanting you and no one else.
You got me raptured.

`Cause time takes
What love heals.
Wherever you are
I know it`s for real.

Whatever you want me to do
I will do it for you.
Whatever you want me to be 
I will be what you need.
Because it`s love that I feel

And I, I know that it`s real.

I know you`ve had flames in your heart
That have torn you apart.
I know you`ve been safe on your own
But together we`re strong.

Whenever you`re holding me.
