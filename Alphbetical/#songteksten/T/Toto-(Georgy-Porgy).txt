It`s not your situation
I just need contemplation all for you
I`m not so systematic
It`s just that I`m an addict for your love

Nothing than I wanna hold you
I never ever should have told you
You`re my only girl
Nothing than I wanna hold you
I never ever should have told you
You`re my only world

Just think how long I`ve known you
It`s wrong for me to own you lock and key
It`s really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion
Can`t you see

Nothing than I wanna hold you
I never ever should have told you
You`re my only girl
Nothing than I wanna hold you
I never ever should have told you
You`re my only world
