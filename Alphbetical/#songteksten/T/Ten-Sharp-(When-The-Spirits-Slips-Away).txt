Where lies the heart
where lies the soul
of all that God's created

Rivers don't flow
flowers don't grow
is men around to waste it

Don't ask me how
when the spirit slips away

Living on dreams
no eye for the sky
isn't it time to change it

And what is to come
of the unborn child
now it's time to face it

Don't ask me how
but time has come to fight

Cos it's really over
and the fire turns into a flame
when the spirit slips away
really over
like a fire into a flame
when the spirit slips away

The song of the whale
is fading away
there is still time to save it

Colours turn pale
without a heart
for all that's God created

Cos it's really over
and the fire turns into a flame
when the spirit slips away
really over
like a fire into a flame
when the spirit slips away

When the spirit....

Don't ask me how
but time has come to fight

Cos it's really over
and the fire turns into a flame
when the spirit slips away
really over
like a fire into a flame
when the spirit slips away

When the spirit....
When the spirit....
When the spirit slips away
When the spirit....
When the spirit slips away
When the spirit....
