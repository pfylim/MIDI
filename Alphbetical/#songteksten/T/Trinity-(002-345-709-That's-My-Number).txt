Operator, operator, help me, help me, help me baby ooh oohoo
You've got my number, call me 002.345.709 that's my number

Day after day you're looking more confused (you looked confused)
Whatever you do, it seems to getting me down babe, ooh
I guess I understand how lonely life has been these days
(Lonely life has been)
Babe, call me mad, now (Call me now)
I'll get you in the mood again, call me

I'll mix you a drink, we're gonna get high babe (we gonna get high)
I'll sing you a song, and we'll take a ride babe
A thousand ups and downs
We'll take it far from everywhere
And we will share, good things together
I'll make your broken heart like new, please call

002.345.709 and I'll be there
002.345.709 that's my number

And maybe God only knows
And all the world will fake him great
And maybe there's only you and I to stay
And then snow only take my day
I love them grow, endlessly
You've got my number, call me
002.345.709 that's my number
002.345.709 and I'll be there
002.345.709 that's my number
002.345.709 and I'll be there
