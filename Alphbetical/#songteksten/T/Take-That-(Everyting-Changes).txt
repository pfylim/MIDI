GIRL, COME ON OVER HERE
LET ME HOLD YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE
AND REMEMBER I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU FOREVER
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
WE'VE SAID GOODBYE THE TAXI CAB IS WAITING

NOW DON'T YOU CRY
JUST ONE MORE KISS BEFORE I HAVE TO GO
HEY GIRL, I KNOW THE SITUATION CHANGED
AND SO MUCH IS NEW
BUT SOMETHING IN MY LIFE REMAINS THE SAME

CHORUS (REFRAIN):
'COS EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
WE'RE A THOUSAND MILES APART
BUT YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU

YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU
THE RUMOURS TRUE YOU KNOW
THAT THERE'VE BEEN OTHERS
WHAT CAN I DO I TELL YOU BABY
THEY DON'T MEAN A THING
NOW GIRL DON'T GO AND THROW OUR LOVE AWAY
I'LL BE HOME SOON BACK IN YOUR ARMS
TO HEAR YOU SAY

CHORUS (REFRAIN)
YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
WE'RE A THOUSAND MILES APART
BUT I STILL LOVE YOU

EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
I'LL SPEND EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT YOU
THROUGH EVERYTHING CHANGES AROUND US
(BABY DON'T YOU CRY)
WE WILL BE THE SAME
AS BEFORE FOREVER MORE

EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
WE'RE A THOUSAND MILES APART
AND I STILL MISS YOU BABY
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE DAY
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU GIRL

EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU
THINKING ABOUT YOU
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
'COS YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU

EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
I'LL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU THINKING ABOUT YOU
EVERYTHING CHANGES BUT YOU
I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU
