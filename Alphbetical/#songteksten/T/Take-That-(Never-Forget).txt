
8. NEVER FORGET - TAKE THAT

Been on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand and hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger of my mind I would stand on the line of hope
I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries
I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight
Just then I realize what a fool I could be
Just 'cause I look so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise isn't easy, but still
There's a road goin' down the other side of the hill

Never forget where you've come here from
Never pretend that it's all real
Someday soon this will be someone elses dream

Been safe from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here
I understand the meaning of "I can explain this feeling"
Now it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand I make
The fact of reality

Chorus......

We've come so far and we've reached so high
And we've looked each day and night in the eye
And were still so young and we hope for more
But remember this
We're not invincible
We're not invincible
No - we're only people, we're only people
We're not invincible
We're not invincible
So again I tell you

Chorus...
