Title  : FUNKY GRANDPA
Artist : THUNDER STORM

(Words & music: Wielkens/Gaddum/Jones)

Funky grandpa's going to the disco
Baggy throusers, high heel sneakers on
Groovin' to the music at the disco
To a group they call the Thunderstorm

No one seems to mind grandpa's business
He shakes his body furhter to the ground
Imagine such a funny situation
Grandpa's raging mad of disco sound

Can't you feel the rhythm, shake it
You just shake your body, break it

Funky grandpa, shake your body

Funky grandpa's going to the disco
Baggy throusers, high heel sneakers on
Groovin' to the disco back in Frisco
Mighty highty till the break of dawn

Grandpa's found the right disconnection
Grandpa's got an awful lot of soul

Can't you feel the rhythm, shake it
You just shake your body, break it (2x)

Funky grandpa, shake your body
