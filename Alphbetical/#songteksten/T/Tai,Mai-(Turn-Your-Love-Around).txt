MAI TAI - TURN YOUR LOVE AROUND

Remember when I met you
You really turned me on
And I can't forget you
We've been in love too long
You knew how to give me
The tenderness I need
Without you to hold me
I feel so incomplete
Lately I feel there's a change
(There's a little change in your attitude)
So I beg of you, please stop your games
(I'll tell you what to do)

Refrain:
Turn your love around
And hold me like you used to
Turn it up and down
(turn it around, turn it around)
Turn your love around
And love me like you used to baby
You know we should be together
Makin' love and dreams forever ...
(ah, aha, ah, aha)

I thought you would need me
The way I needed you
But now my eyes are open
And I can see the truth
Can't live with the suspicion
And wait for you all night
I feel by intuition
There is so much you hide

Refrain: ...(2x)...

There ain't a man alive
Who can love me this way
I want your love to survive
Be with you, day by day
