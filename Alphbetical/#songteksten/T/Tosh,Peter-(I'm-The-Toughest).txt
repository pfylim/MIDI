Title  : I'M THE TOUGHEST

(Words & music: Shakespeare/Tosh)

Chorus:
Anything you can do
I can do it better
I'm the toughest
(I'm the toughest)
I can do what you can't do
I'm the toughest
(I'm the toughest)

Stop from doing wrongs
Change your foolish plans
Stop from doing wrongs
Live up like a man
I'm the toughest
(I'm the toughest)

Now my little brothers
You got to be good
Do what's right
Don't be bad minded
Take what yours, and
There'll be no fuse nor fight

Chorus:

Stop from doing wrongs
Change your foolish plans
Stop from doing wrongs
Live up like a man
I'm the toughest
(I'm the toughest)

Now my brothers
You got to be good
Just do what yo know is right
Don't be bad minded
Just take what's yours
And there be no fuss or fight

Chorus: ...
