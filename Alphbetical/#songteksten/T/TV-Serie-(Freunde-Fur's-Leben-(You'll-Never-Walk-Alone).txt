5. FREUNDE FšR'S LEBEN (YOU NEVER WALK ALONE)

This song's for you
David Lookaleeon
It shall guide you through the night
And help you through the day
Whenever things go wrong
I'll be with you
Whenever clouds are there
We'll fight them through.

You never walk alone
I'll be with you
Never walk alone
I'll be with you
When you think you have to cry
Then rest a little by my side 
You should know 
You never walk alone.

This song's for you
David Lookaleeon
It's a song just for you
Too bright to love your day
Whenever things go wrong
I'll be with you
Whenever clouds are there
We'll fight them through.

You never walk alone 
I'll be with you
Never walk alone
I'll be with you
When you think you have to cry
Then rest a little by my side 
You should know 
You never walk alone.

You never walk alone
I'll be with you
Never walk alone
I'll be with you
When you think you have to cry
Then rest a little by my side
You should know 
You never walk alone. (Walk alone)

You never walk alone (Never walk alone)
Never walk alone (You never walk alone)
And when you think you have to cry
Then rest a little by my side
You should know 
You never walk alone.
