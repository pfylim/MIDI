Title  : Young Souls
Singer : Angela And The Rude


Shadows in the night are frightening
Bad dreams are following you
Fear of thunder and lightning
Young souls have to see it all through (2x)
You're a young soul
You'll have to see it all through
Life is so hard to understand
You got to live it, the best you can
Your guides will lead you through the end
Young souls have to see it all through
You're a young soul
You'll have to see it all through
Woho you're a young soul
You'll have to see it all through
Never stop believing
There's a place for you
Memories will fade away
But souls are forever, we all have to see it all thru
Young souls, you're a young soul
