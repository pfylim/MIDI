Here I am playing with those memories again
and just when I thought time had set me free
those thoughts of you keep taunting me.

Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
though each and every part of me has tried
only you can fill that space inside.

So there's no sense pretending
my heart it's not mending.

Just when I thought I was over you
and just when I thought I could stand on my own
oh baby those memories come crashing through
and I just can't go on without you.

On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
but only you can stop the rain.

I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you.

Just when I thought I was over you
and just when I thought I could stand on my own
oh baby those memories come crashing through
and I just can't go on without you.
Go on without
it's just no good without you.
