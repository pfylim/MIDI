MARC ALMOND - SOMETHING'S GOTTEN HOLD OF MY HEART


Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
Something's gotten into my life
Cutting it's way, through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile and making me frown

Refrain:
In a world that was small
I once lived in a time
That was peace and no troubles at all
But then you came my way
And feeling unknown
Shook my heart made me want you to stay
All of my nights and all of my days
Yeh, I got to tell you now

Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeh, something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a color so bright
Changing the gray, changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you

I've got to know if this is the real thing
I've got to know what's making my heart sing
Whohoo yeeeeeh
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime
Each minute spent with you is the right time
Every hour, yeh every day hey
You touch me and my mind goes a stray
And ba-by and ba-by

Something's gotten hold of my hand
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
Yeh, something's gotten into my life
Cutting it's way through my dreams like a knife
Turning me up, turning me down
Making me smile, making me frown

Refrain: ...

Something's gotten hold of my heart
Keeping my soul and my senses apart
something has invaded my night
Painting my sleep with a color so bright
Changing the gray, changing the blue
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you
