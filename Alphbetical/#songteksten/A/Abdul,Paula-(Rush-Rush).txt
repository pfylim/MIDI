You're the whisper of a summer breeze
You're the kiss that puts my soul at ease
What I'm saying is I'm in to you
Here's my story, and the story goes
You give love, you get love
And more than, heaven knows
You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love
Right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh baby, baby please
--------------------------------------------------------
   Rush, Rush
   Hurry, hurry lover
   Come to me, Rush, Rush
   I wanna see, I wanna see ya
   et free with me, Rush, Rush
   I can feel it, I can feel you
   All through me , Rush, Rush
   Ooh what you do to me
--------------------------------------------------------
And all I want from you is
What you are
And even if you're right next to me
You're still too far away
If I'm not inside your arms
I get dramatic baby, yes I know
But I need you, I want you
Ooh man, I love you so oh, ooh
You're gonna see, I'm gonna run
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love
Right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Ooh baby, baby please

   et free with me, Rush, Rush
   I can feel it, I can feel you
   All through me , Rush, Rush
   Ooh what you do to me
--------------------------------------------------------
When you kiss me up and down
Turn my senses all around
Oh baby, oh baby
I don't know, just how or why
But no one else has touched me
So deep, so deep
So deep inside
You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love
Right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh baby baby please
