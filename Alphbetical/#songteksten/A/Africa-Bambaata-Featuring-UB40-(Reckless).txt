AFRIKA BAMBAATA FEATURING UB40 - RECKLESS

You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless

Standing by the disco floor, spot this girl
My heart jump and move yeah yeah
Walk over said to her loving things
She said I was a fool, oh no

She said, this is not the right time baby 
I came here to groove
And recklessly, I took my time
When I look back
The girls had made a move yeah, yeah

The music played on, played on
Why didn't you make your move
Somebody came on, came on
And stole the girl from you
It's the groove, that makes you move

Some come on and get down
To this funky sound
Do what you please
You're entitled to flaunt
Get wild and reckless
If you want
'Cause the sounds we deliver
Will take you higher
Most definitely with
Desire, desire, de si si si si sire

Chorus:
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless

So as the music play
I had to find a way to catch her eye yeah yeah
The partner she was with
He did not know how to gig
Said I, oh no

She said, mister get away from me
I need a man, that knows how to move yeah yeah
We start to dance
Suddenly a quick romance, ooh yeah yeah

The music played on, played on
Why didn't you make your move
Somebody came on, came on
And stole the girl from you

This is a message
That you should discover
You can't trust a girl
Or judge them by their cover
They can lead you on
And keep you in a daze
Keep you head over heels
And keep you amazed
It's up to the whether you fall in the trap
Just remember when you push up
To have a strong rap
Cos now-a-days 
Things are real funny
You can bet more than all she wants
Is your money

So listen take heed to what I say
With or without
Yo the girls ok
Girls are the same everywhere
You can bet all they want from you
Is what they can get
And when they finish
You can bet that you've tried her
They'll leave you penniless
With desire

You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
You make me reckless, reckless everyday
You make me reckless
