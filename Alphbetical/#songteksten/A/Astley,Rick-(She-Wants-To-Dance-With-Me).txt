RICK ASTLEY - SHE WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME

She wants to dance
Ooh she wants to dance with me
Oh, oh, yeah (dance with me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

There's a girl I've been waiting to see
And I really get the feeling that she likes me
'Cause she said so but not in so many words
I've got to tell you what I heard
She don't want no wild romance
When she's with me she only wants to dance

refrain:
She wants to dance with me
'Cause I'll hold her so tight next to me
She wants to dance with me
'Cause I'll let her be what she wants to be
Now I know I've been out of touch
And I never meant to hurt my baby, oh, so much
'Cause I love her and I think she loves me
And that's the way it's got to be
When we're together we never fight
We've got better things to do tonight

refrain: ...
