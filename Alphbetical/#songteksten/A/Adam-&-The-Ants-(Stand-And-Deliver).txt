Title  : STAND AND DELIVER
Artist : ADAM AND THE ANTS

(Words & music: Adam Ant/Marco Pirroni)

I'm the dandy highwayman
Who you're too scared to mention
I spend my cash on looking flash
And grabbing your attention

The devil take your stereo
And your record collection
The way you look, you'll qualify
For next year's old age pension

Chorus:
Stand and deliver
Your money or your live
Try and use a mirror
No bullet or a knife

I'm the dandy highwayman
So tired of easy fashion
The clumsy books, peeaboo roots
That people think so dashing

So what's the point of robbery?
When nothing is worth taking
It's kind of tough to tell a scruff
The big mistake he's making

Chorus: ...

And even though you fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
All mine

So tired of excuses
Of deep meaning philosophies
Where only showbiz loses

We're the dandy highwaymen
And here's our invitation
Throw your safety overboard
And join the insect nation

Chorus: ...

And ever fool your soul
Your conscience will be mine
Da diddley qua qua, da diddley qua qua
