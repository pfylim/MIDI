Title  : HOW LONG
Artist : ACE / LIPPS INC.

(Words & music: Paul Carrack)

How long, has this been going on
How long, has this been going on

Well your friends with their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme
But I can't help but have my suspicion
'Cause I ain't quite as dumb as I seem
Wel, you said you were never intending
To break up our scene in this way
But there ain't any use in pretending
It could happen to us every day

How long, has this been going on
How long, has this been going on
