You can't stand still for a moment
you can't stand still for a night
your feet just starta move when it's boring
but you gotta stick around to get it right
so get it right
you can't find love in the kitchen
you walk the dark side of the street
you can't find any hope in religion
ya gotta feel the road under your feet

I'm gonna shed a little light
I'm gonna love ya every night
we'll get it right - get it right !

If you wanna leave me can I come too
if you wanna leave me gonna go with you
if you say no - I'm still gonna go
if you wanna leave me - can I come too ?

You try'n keep dry in the water
you try'n keep cool in the fire
the politics of love are getting harder
so grab a hold, take my hand, we'll take it higher !
