8. Living In Danger - Ace Of Base

(Say it for yourself it's a wonderful team
You can do what you want
You can live in a dream
Get up, get in, get the rhythm, get down)

You're living your life in peace and in harmony
You're making your own decisions
That's how it's got to be for you and me
So many people are running round and round
Without any sense or logic
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Please yourself it's a wonderful world
You can do what you want)
Wow
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Wow
You'll be living in danger
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
Wow
You'll be living in danger

(Huh)
People are the same today as they used to be
The same expectations
So high no one can reach that high
Nor I nor you get satisfied today
We never get enough
I see lies in the eyes of a stranger
(Please yourself it's a wonderful world)
Wow
