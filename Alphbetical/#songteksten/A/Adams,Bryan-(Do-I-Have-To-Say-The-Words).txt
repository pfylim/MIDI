Rescue me from the mire
whisper words of desire
rescue me - darling rescue me
with your arms open wide
want you here by my side
come to me - darling rescue me
when this worlds closing in
there's no need to pretend
set me free - darling rescue me

I don't wanna let you go
so I'm standing in your way
I never needed anyone like I'm needin' you today

Do I have to say the words ?
Do I have to tell the truth ?
Do I have to shout it out ?
Do I have to say a prayer ?
Must I prove to you how good we are together ?
Do I have to say the words 

Rescue me from despair
tell me you will be there
rescue me - darlin' rescue me

Every dream that we share
every cross that we bear
come to me - darlin' rescue me
