Singer : AMERICAN GYPSY 
Title  : ANGEL EYES

Refrain:
Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes
Now don't you worry 'bout me
Angel eyes, angel eyes, angel eyes
Now don't you worry 'bout me

Oh angel eyes I've got a teaspoon-full emotion
A cup of brains poored out (of) the most rational ocean
Deep is the river I wade through duties and devotion
No love predestination, nation love my sweet devotion
And I tell you
And I tell you
And I tell you
I'm gonna tell you
I just can't go wrong

Refrain: ...(2x)...

I don't want to live apart man

How, angel eyes, you've gotta look down upon me
Isn't it a little funny I mean
All through my life I may search for something
And isn't it nice to be a part of the scene
And I tell you
And I tell you
And I tell you
I'm gonna tell you
I just can't go wrong

Refrain: ...(2x)...

I don't want to live apart man

Angel, angel eyes
C.I. angel eyes

Angel eyes, angel eyes
Angel eyes, angel eyes
