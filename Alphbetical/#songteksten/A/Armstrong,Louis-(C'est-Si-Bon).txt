
4. C'est Si Bon - Louis Amstrong

C'est si bon
Lovers say that in France
When they thrill to romance
It means that it's so good
Oh, c'est si bon
So I say it to you
Like the French people do
Because it's oh so good
Babadoo...

Every word
Every sigh
Every kiss, dear
Leads to only one thought
And it's this, dear.

It's so good
Nothing else can replace
Just your slightest embrace
And if you only would
Be my own
For the rest of my days
I will whisper this phrase
My darling, c'est si bon
Oui oui.
