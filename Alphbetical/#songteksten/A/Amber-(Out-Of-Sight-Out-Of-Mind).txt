Singer : AMBER 
Title  : OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND

(Words & music: G. Stellaard/H.D. Breemer)

Refrain:
Out of sight, out of mind
We're two of a kind, maybe you'll see honey
Out of mind, out of sight
Guess who's winning tonight
Not you, who who, but me

It wasn't hard to discover
I was just another lover, baby
A so called woman's intuition
Made me part of this decision, honey
Sure I'm bad at understanding
You are good at self-defending, maybe
Still trying hard to find excuses
Being smart almost amuses me

Refrain: ...

Don't think your loving I regret it
Not at all, but now I've had it, baby
Go out and find your other victim
And be proud of how you trick them, honey
And if your ego is happy with it
Tell your buddies how I did it, cherrie
Suppose you know my act as well as
All your friendly cosy fellows, baby

Refrain: ...
