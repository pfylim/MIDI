APOLLONIA 6 - SEX SHOOTER

I need you to get me off
I'm your bomb baby ready to explode
I need you to get me off
I'll be your slave - do anything I'm told
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
Come on kiss the gun
I need you to pull my trigger baby
I can't do it alone
I need you to be main thang play thang
Pilar of stone

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
Come on kiss the gun

No girl's baby can compete with mine
No girl's rap can top my lines
No girl's kiss can ring your chimes
Come on boy let's make some time

I'm a sex shooter
Shootin' love in your direction
Yeah I'm a sex shooter
Come and play with my affection
