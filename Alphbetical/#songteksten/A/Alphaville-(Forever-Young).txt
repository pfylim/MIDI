7. FOREVER YOUNG - ALPHAVILLE

Intro (8 Takte ohne Drums und Rhythmusgruppe, nur Synthesizer):

Vers 1 (ohne Drums und Rhythmusgruppe):
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
Are you going to drop the bomb or not? 
Let us die young or let us live forever -
We don't have the power but we never say never.
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip,
The music's for the sad men 
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun,
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune,
The music's played by the .. mad men.

1.Refrain (ohne Drums und Rhythmusgruppe):
Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever, forever - and ever ?
Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever? 
Forever young. 

Bridge (2 Takte instrumental inkl. Auftakt zum 2.Vers,  Einsatz Drums):

Vers 2:
Some are like water, some are like the heat,
Some are the melody and some are the beat.
Sooner or later, they all will be gone - why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause,
I don't want to perish like a fading horse.
Youth's like diamonds in the sun .. and diamonds are forever!
So many adventures couldn't happen today,
So many songs we forgot to play,
So many dreams swinging out of the blue - we'll let them come true

2.Refrain:
Forever young, I want to be  forever young 
Do you really want to live forever, forever - and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever - and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever?
