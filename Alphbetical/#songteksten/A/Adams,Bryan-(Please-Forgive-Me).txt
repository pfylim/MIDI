  PLEASE FORGIVE ME (BRYAN ADAMS)
  
  Still feels like the first night together
  Feels like the first kiss
  It's getting better baby
  no one can bear  this
  Still holding on you're still the one
  
  First time I rise, man
  same feeling I get
  only feels much stronger
  I wanna love you longer
  You still turn the fire around
  
  If you're feeling lonely, don't
  you're the only one I ever want
  Only one to make it good
  So if I love you, need ye more than I should
  Please forgive me I don't know what I do
  Please forgive me
  I can't stop loving you
  Don't deny me
  the strain I'm gonna through
  Please forgive me
  If I need you like I do
  Please believe me
  We were to see it through
  Please forgive me
  I can't stop loving you
  
  Still feels like our best time together
  Feels like the first touch
  Still getting closer babe
  Can't get close enough
  Still holding on
  Still number one
  
  I remember the smell of your skin
  I remember everything
  I remember all your moves
  I remember you, yeah
  I remember the nights, you know I still do
  
  If you're feeling lonely, don't
  you're the only one I ever want
  Only one to make it good
  So if I love you, need ye more than I should
  Please forgive me I know not what I'd do
  Please forgive me
  I can't stop loving you
  Don't deny me
  The strain I'm going through
  Please forgive me
  If  I need you like I do
  Oh believe it
  We were to see it through
  Please forgive me
  I can't stop loving you
  
  One thing  I'm sure of
  Is the way we make love
  One thing I depend on
  Is for us to stay strong
  With everyone in every place I'm praying
  That's why I'm saying
  
  Please forgive me I know not
