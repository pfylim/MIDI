  THE SIGN (ACE OF BASE)
  
  I, I got a new life
  You would hardly recognize me
  I'm so glad
  How can a person like me care for you
  Why do I bother
  When you're not the one for me
  Is enough enough
  
  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
  Life is demanding without understanding
  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
  No one's gonna drag you up
  To get into the light where you belong
  But where do you belong
  
  I, under the pale moon
  For so many years I've wondered
  Who you are
  How can a person like you bring me joy
  Under the pale moon
  Where I see a lot of stars
  Is enough enough
  
  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
  Life is demanding without understanding
  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
  No one's gonna drag you up
  To get into the light where you belong
  But where do you belong
  
  I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
  And I am happy now
  Living without you
  I've left you
  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
  no one's gonna drag you up
  to get into the light where you belong
  
  I saw the sign I saw the sign
  I saw the sign
  I saw the sign I saw the sign
  and it opened up my eyes
  I saw the sign
