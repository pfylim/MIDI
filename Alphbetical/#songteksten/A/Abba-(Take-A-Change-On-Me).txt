Interpret:        ABBA

Vers 1:
------------------------------------------------------
If you change your mind
I'm the first in line 
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
If you need me let me know gonna be around.
If you got no place to go when you're
feeling down.
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me
gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie.
If you put me to the test if you let me try,
take a chance on me,
take a chance on me.
------------------------------------------------------

We can go dancing,
we can go walking as long as we're together
listen to some music
maybe just talking you'd
get to know me better
'cause you know I got so much that I wanna do.

When I dream I'm alone with you,
it's magic.
You want me to leave it there
afraid of a love affair, but I think you know
that I can't let you go.

Vers 1:
-----------------------------------------------------
If you change...
-----------------------------------------------------

Oh you can take your time baby,
I'm in no hurry I know I'm gonna get you,
you don't wanna hurt me baby
don't worry I ain't gonna let you.
Let me tall you now my love is strong enough
to last when things are rough, it's magic.
You say, that I waste my time
but I can't get it of my mind.
No I can't let go ' cause I love you so.

If you change your mind I'm the first in line
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.
If you let me know gonna be around.
If you got no place to go
when you're feeling down.
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown
Honey I'm still free,
take a chance on me
gonna do my very best
baby can't you see
gotta put me to the test take a chance on me.
