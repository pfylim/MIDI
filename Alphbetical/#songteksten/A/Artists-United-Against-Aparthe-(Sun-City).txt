Title  : Sun City
Singer : Artists United Against Apartheid


We're rockers and rappers united and strong
We're here to talk about South Africa
We don't like what's going on
It's time for some justice
It's time for the truth
We've realized there's only
One thing we can do
I ain't gonna play Sun City

Relocation to phoney homelands
Separation of families I can't understand
23 Million can't vote because they're black
We're stabbing our brothers
And sisters in the back

Our government tells us 
We're doing all we can
Constructive engagement
Is Ronald Reagan's plan
Meanwhile people are dying
And giving up hope
This quiet diplomacy
Ain't nothing but a joke

Bophuthatswana is far away
But we know it's in South Africa
No matter what they say
You can't buy me
I don't care what you pay
Don't ask me Sun City
Because I ain't gonna play

It's time to accept our responsibility
Freedom is a privilege
Nobody rides for free
Look around the world baby
It can't be denied
Why are we always on the wrong side
