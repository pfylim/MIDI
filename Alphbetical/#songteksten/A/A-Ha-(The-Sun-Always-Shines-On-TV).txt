Title  : The Sun Always Shines On TV
Singer : A-Ha


Touch me
How can it be
Believe me
The sun always shines on tv
Hold me
Close to your heart
Touch me
And give all your love to me
To me
I reached inside myself
And found
Nothing there to ease
The pressure of my ever
Worrying mind
All my powers waste away I fear
The crazed and lonely looks
The mirror's sending me these days
Please don't ask me to defend
The shameful lowlands of
The way I'm drifting gloomily
Through time
I reached inside myself
Today thinking
There's got to be some way
To keep troubles distant
