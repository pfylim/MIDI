Title  : HAVING MY BABY

Having my baby, what a lovely way
Of saying how much you love me
Having my baby, what a lovely way
Of saying what you're thinking of me

I can see it, your face is glowing
I can see it in your eyes
I'm happy knowing
That you're having my baby

You're the woman I love
And I love what it's doin' to you
Having my baby, you're a woman in love
And I love what's goin' through you

The need inside you, I see it showin'
Oh, the seed inside you baby do you feel it growing
Are you happy knowing, that you're having my baby

(Girl)
I'm a woman in love
And love what's doin' to me

Having me baby

(Girl)
I'm a woman in love
And love what's doin' to me

Didn't have to keep it
Wouldn't put you through it
You could have swept it from your life
But you wouldn't do it
No you wouldn't do it
And you're having my baby
