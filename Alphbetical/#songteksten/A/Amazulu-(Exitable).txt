AMAZULU - EXCITABLE

You blow so hot then you blow so cold
When I make adjustments to you vertical hold
You hit the roof then you hit the floor
You keep me dancing till my feet get sore

Baby, you're so excitable
I don't care if you get me into trouble
Baby, you're so excitable
Won't you share some excitement with me tonight

I wanna stay in, you wanna go out
I get nervous when you scream and shout
You blow your top and I mend your fuse
You make me offers that I can't refuse

Baby, you're so excitable
I don't care if you get me into trouble
Baby, you're so excitable
I don't want you to change your ways
I'm happy to follow your star
I'll just take you the way that you are

Baby, you're so excitable
I don't care if you get me into trouble
Baby, you're so excitable
I don't want you to change your ways
I'm happy to follow your star
I'll just take you the way that you are

Take a look at the state I'm in
I'm drowning in adrenaline
I hang on 'cause I can't let go
One look at you and I can't say no

Baby, you're so excitable
I don't care if you get me into trouble
Baby, you're so excitable
Won't you share some excitement with me tonight
