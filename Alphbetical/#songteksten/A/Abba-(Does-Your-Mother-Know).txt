You're so hot teasing me, so you're blue
but I can't take a chance on a chick like you,
it's something I couldn't do.
Thre's that look in your eyes,
I can read in your face that your feelings
are driving you wild,
ah, but girl, you're only a child.

Well, I could dance with you, honey,
if you think it's funny, does your mother know
that you're out ?
And I could chat with you, baby,
flirt a little maybe, does your mother know
that you're out ?
Take it easy (take it easy)
better slow down, girl,
that's no way to go (does your mother know ?)
Take it easy (take it easy)
try to cool it, girl,
play it nice and slow (does your mother know ?)

I can see what you want but you seem
pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun,
so maybe I'm not the one.
You're so cute, I like your stile,
and I know what you mean
when you give me a flash of that smile,
ah, but girl, you're only a child.

Well, I could dance with you, honey,...
