It was one of those nights
When you turn out the lights
And verythin' comes into view
She was takin' her time
I was losin' my mind
There was nothin' that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we where makin' love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove.

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She got a touch, a touch to much.

She's the face of an angel
Smilin' with sin
The body of venus with arms
Dealin' with danger
Strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightnin' storm
It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
She wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
