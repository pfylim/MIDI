Well there's gonna be a party gonna make some noise
yeah we're invitin' all the girls - invitin' all the boys
there'll be dancin' on the tables dancin' on the chairs
ya there'll be dancin' in the parkin' lots
and up and down the stairs - alright
close the windows - lock the doors
turn it up now - pack the floors
cops are on the outside - landlord's on the phone
quick turn out all the lights
pretend there ain't nobody home !

It's a house arrest - everybody run
I gotta plead guilty havin' - too much fun
this is a house arrest - up against the wall
we can't stop rockin' justa havin' a ball - one and all

Won't you come around to my place
don't cha know it's overdue
you gotta bring your little lady wear your dancin' shoes
get a yellow Taxi - take a limousine
you gotta get there - it's gonna be a scene
it's too late can't wait - get out while you can
it was fun while it lasted let's do it all again

It's a house arrest - everybody run
I gotta plead guilty havin' - too much fun
this is a house arrest - up against the wall
we can't stop rockin' justa havin' a ball - one and all

We bin walkin' up the neighbours
bouncin' off the walls
hangin' off the ceilings
we'll be dancin' in and out of the halls !

This is a house arrest everybody move
gotta plead guilty gonna raise the roof
this is a house arrest..... !
