Title  : Prince Charming
Singer : Adam and the Ants


Don't you ever, don't you ever
Stop being dandy?
Showing me you're handsome (2x)

Prince charming, prince charming
Ridicule is nothing to be scared of

Don't you ever, don't you ever
Stop being dandy?
Showing me you're handsome

Don't you ever, don't you ever
Lower yourself?
Forgetting all your standards (2x)

Prince charming, prince charming
Ridicule is nothing to be scared of

Don't you ever, don't you ever
Stop being a dandy?
Showing me you're handsome

Silk or leather or a feather
Respect yourself and all of those around me


Words & Music : Adam Ant, Marco Pirroni
