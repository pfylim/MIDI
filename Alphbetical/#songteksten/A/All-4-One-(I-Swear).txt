  5. I SWEAR - ALL 4 ONE
  
  I SWEAR BY THE MOON
  AND THE STARS IN THE SKIES
  AND I SWEAR LIKE THE SHADOW
  THAT'S BY YOUR SIDE
  
  I SEE THE QUESTIONS IN YOUR EYES
  I KNOW WHAT'S WEIGHTING ON YOUR MIND
  YOU CAN BE SURE
  I KNOW MY PART
  'CAUSE I'LL STAND BESIDE YOU
  THROUGH THE YEARS
  YOU'LL ONLY CRY THOSE HAPPY TEARS
  AND THOUGH I'LL MAKE MISTAKES
  I'LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART
  
  AND I SWEAR BY THE MOON
  AND THE STARS IN THE SKIES
  I'LL BE THERE
  I SWEAR LIKE THE SHADOW
  THAT'S BESIDE YOU
  I'LL BE THERE
  FOR BETTER OR WORSE
  TILL DEATH DO US PART
  I'LL LOVE YOU WITH BEAT
  OF MY HEART
  
  AND I SWEAR
  
  I'LL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING I CAN
  I'LL BUILD YOUR DREAMS
  WITH THESE TWO HANDS
  WE'LL HANG SOME MEMORIES
  ON THE WALLS
  AND WHEN JUST THE TWO OF US ARE THERE
  YOU WON'T HAVE TO ASK
  IF I STILL CARE
  'CAUSE AS THE TIME TURNS THE PAGE
  MY LOVE WON'T AGE AT ALL
  
  AND I SWEAR BY THE MOON
  AND THE STARS IN THE SKIES
  I'LL BE THERE
  I SWEAR LIKE THE SHADOW
  THAT'S BESIDE YOU
  I'LL BE THERE
  FOR BETTER OR WORSE
  TILL DEATH DO US PART
  I'LL LOVE YOU WITH BEAT
  OF MY HEART
