Title  : KNOWING ME, KNOWING YOU

(Words & music: Andersen/Andersen/Ulvaeus)

Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house
Tears in my eyes
This is where the story ends
This is goodbye

Refrain:
Knowing me, knowing you
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
We just have to face it
This time we're through
Breaking up is never easy
I know, but I have to go
Knowing me, knowing you
It's the best I can do

Memories, good days, bad days
They'll be with me always
In these old familiar rooms
Children would play
Now there's only emptiness
Nothing to say

Refrain: ...
