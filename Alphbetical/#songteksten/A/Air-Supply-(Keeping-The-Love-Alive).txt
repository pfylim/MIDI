Both of us holding back
so afraid
to fall in love and lose again
we've both been hurt before
saw love walk out the door
in the end...

Actin' as cold as ice
when we wanna be
just a foolish game we play
you couldn't hurt me bad enough
to make me give it up
and walk away.

We can't stop
the feeling's too strong
we've got the will to hang on
can't stop
we struggle and fight to survive
keepin' the love alive.

We try to forget the past
so many times
it's hard to make those memories leave
with all we have at stake
we'll bend until we break
'cause we both believe.

We can't stop
the feeling's too strong
we've got the will to hang on
can't stop
we struggle and fight to survive
keepin' the love alive.

If we stand the test of time
love will be the lasting kind.

We can't stop
the feeling's too strong
we've got the will to hang on
can't stop
we struggle and fight to survive
keepin' the love alive.
