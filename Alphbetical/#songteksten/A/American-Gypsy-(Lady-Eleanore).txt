Singer : AMERICAN GYPSY 
Title  : LADY ELEANORE

Bashee playing magician sitting lotus on the floor
Belly dancing beauty with a power driven saw
Had my share of nightmares, didn't think
There could be much more
Then in came Rod'rick Usher with the Lady Eleanore

She tied my eyes with ribbon of a silken ghostly thread
I gazed with troubled vision on an old four poster bed
Where Eleanore had risen to kiss the neck below my head
And bid me come along with her to the land of dancing dead

But it's alright Lady Eleanore
All right Lady Eleanore
I'm right where I am

She gazed with loving beauty like a mother to a son
Like living, dying, seeing, being all rolled into one
Then all at once I heard some music playing in my bones
The same old song I'd heard for years
Reminding me of home

She creeping on towards me, licking lips
With tongues of fire
A host of golden demons screaming lust and base desire
An when it seemed for certain that the screams
Could get no higher
I heard a voice above the rest screaming, you're a lair

But it's alright Lady Eleanore
All right Lady Eleanore
I'm right where I am
Then I'm all right here in your arms
