Title   : WATERLOO

My my, at Waterloo Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah, and I have met my destiny
In quite a similar way
The history-book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Refrain:
Waterloo
I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo
Promise to love you forever more
Waterloo
Couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo
Knowing my fate is to be with you
Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

My my, I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah, and now it seems my only chance
Is givin' up the fight
And how could I ever refuse
I feel like I win when I loose

Refrain: ...
