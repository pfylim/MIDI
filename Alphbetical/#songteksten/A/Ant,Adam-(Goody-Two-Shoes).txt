Title  : Goody Two Shoes
Singer : Adam Ant


With the heartbreak open
So much you can't hide
Put on a little make-up
Make sure they get your good side
If the words unspoken
Get stuck in your throat
Send a treasure token
Write it on a pound note

Goody two, goody two
Goody goody two shoes

You don't drink, you don't smoke
What do you do?
The subtle innuendos follow
There must be something inside

We don't follow fashion
That'd be a joke
You know we're gonna set them
So everyone can take note
When I saw you kneeling
Crying words that you mean
Opening the eyeballs
Pretending that you're all green

No one's gonna tell me
What's wrong and what's right
Or tell me who to eat with, sleep with
Or foul up on the big fight
Look out or they'll tell you
You're a superstar
Two weeks and you're an all-time legend
I think the games have gone much too far
