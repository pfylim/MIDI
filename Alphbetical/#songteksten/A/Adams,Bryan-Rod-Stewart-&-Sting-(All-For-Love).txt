  ALL FOR LOVE (STING/ADAMS/STEWART)
  
  When it's love you give
  I'll be a man of good faith
  Then in love you live
  I'll make a stand I won't break
  I'll be the rock you can build on
  Be there when you're old
  To have and to hold
  
  When there's love inside
  I swear I'll always feel strong
  And there's a reason why
  I'll prove to you we belong
  I'll be the one that protects you, yeah
  From the wind and the rain
  From the hurt and the pain
  Yeah
  Hei!
  
  Let's make it all for one
  And all for love
  Let the one you hold be the one you want
  The one you need
  
  Cause
  When it's all for one
  It's one for all
  When there's someone that you know
  Then just let your feelings show
  And make it
  All for one and
  All for love
  
  When it's love you make
  I'll be the fire in your night
  And then it's love you take
  I will defend I will fight
  I'll be there when you need me
  When honor's at stake
  This vow I will make
  Yeah
  
  Then it's... all for one
  And  all for love (all for love)
  Let the one you hold be the one you want
  The one you need
  Cause when it's all for one
  It's one for all
  When there's someone that you know
  Then just let your feelings show
  And make it
  All for one
  All for love
  
  Don't lay our love to rest
  Cause we can stand up to the test
  We got everything and more
  Than we had planned
  More than the rivers
  That run the land
  We got it all in our hand
  
  Now it's all for one
  And all for love (all for love)
  Let the one you hold be the one you want
  The one you need
  Cause when it's all for one
  It's one for all (it's one for all)
  
  When there's someone that you know
  Then just let your feelings show
  When there's someone that you want
  When there's someone that you need
  Just make it all
  All for one
  And all for love.
