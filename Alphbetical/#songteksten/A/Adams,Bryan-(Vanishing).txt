People all over build on solid ground
they build it up and then they teyr it down
take it or leave it who cares how much it costs
they'll never know how much is gone until it's lost
'til it's vanishing

Think I hear thunder ain't no sign of rain
danger signs flashin' in my brain
ridin' on empty - lights are turnin' red
there ain't no lovin' left in this empty bed
ya it's vanishing

We're sittin' on treasure call it sacred ground
why look for more babe when it's right here to be found

Never gonna lose ya - ya know I'm gonna fight
this thing's worth saving girl - ya know we'll make it right

If it takes all night - gonna swim your sea
gonna sail your ocean - gonna shake your tree
gonna climb your mountain - gonna shine your light
wanna row your river darlin' - if it takes all night

Peopla all over build mansions in the sky
they choke on smoke and watch their dreams go by
when the phone stops ringin' love has surely died
but the grass is greener babe on the other side

Never gonna lose ya - ya know I'm gonna fight
this thing's worth saving girl - ya know we'll make it right

If it takes all night - gonna swim your sea
gonna sail your ocean - gonna shake your tree
gonna climb your mountain - gonna shine your light
wanna row your river darlin' - if it takes all night

You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
watcha gonna do without a shoulder to lean on
you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Never gonna lose ya - ya know I'm gonna fight
this thing's worth saving girl - ya know we'll make it right.....
if it takes all night
