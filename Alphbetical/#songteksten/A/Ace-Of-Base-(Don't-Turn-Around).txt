  2. DON'T TURN AROUND (ACE OF BASE)
  
  I WILL SURVIVE
  DON'T TELL ME THAT YOU WANNA GO
  IF YOU WANNA LEAVE
  I WON'T BEG YOU TO STAY
  AND IF YOU GOTTA GO, DARLIN'
  MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAT WAY
  I'M GONNA DO FINE
  DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS HEART OF MINE
  JUST WALK OUT THAT DOOR, YEAH
  SEE IF I CARE
  GO ON AND GO NOW
  
  CHORUS:
  
  BUT DON'T TURN AROUND
  'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SEE MY HEART BREAKIN'
  DON'T TURN AROUND
  I DON'T WANT YOU SEEIN' ME CRY
  JUST WALK AWAY
  IT'S TEARIN' ME APART
  THAT YOU'RE LEAVIN'
  I'M LETTIN' YOU GO
  BUT I WON'T LET YOU KNOW
  BUT I WON'T LET YOU KNOW
  
  IF YOU WANNA LAY YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
  HOLDIN' ME TIGHT
  AND IF YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ME
  JUST KNOW
  THAT I'LL BE ALRIGHT
  I'M GONNA BE STRONG
  I'M GONNA DO FINE
  DON'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE HEART OF MINE
  I KNOW I'LL SURVIVE
  SURE I'LL MAKE IT THEN
  AND I'LL EVEN GO NOW
  
  REPEAT CHORUS
  
  I WISH I COULD SCREAM OUT LOUD
  THAT I LOVE YOU
  I WISH I COULD SING TO YA
  DON'T GO
  DON'T GO
  
  REPEAT CHORUS
