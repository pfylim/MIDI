MARK ANTHONY - 1919 MAINSTREET

(Words & music: Steve Birch/Preston Glass/Noel Closson)

Everybody I hear they're throwin' down a new club that's happenin'
Midnight party in the heart of town the music is slamming
They don't even have to advertise it
Just don't get there late or they turn you away
Daylight you can hardly recognize it
Music keeps it jumpin'

Refrain:
One two three four five six seven eight
Nineteen nineteen Main Street
That's where all of the party people meet
Nineteen nineteen Main Street
You know you found it when you feel the beat

Height of fashion they let you in the room
'Cross the sidewalk
Life's in fashion smoke and strong perfume
Tight dresses and girl talk
He's just passin' to impress the ladies
Darlin' hopes tonight she will find the perfect guy
Player drops the keys to his Mercedes
Music keeps it jumpin'

Refrain: ...
