People everywhere, a sense of expectation hangin' in the air
givin' out a spark, across the room
your eyes are glowin' in the dark.
and here we go again, we know the start,
we know the end, masters of the scene.
we've done it all before and now we're back
to get some more, you know what I mean.

I know what you think, the girl means business
so I'll offer her a drink
lookin' mighty proud
I see you leave your table pushin' through the crowd.
I'm really glad you came, masters of the scene.
We've done it all before and now we're back
to get some more, you know what I mean.

Voulez-vous, take it now or leave it
now is all we get, nothing promised, no regrets.
Voulez-vous, ain't no big decision
you know what to do, la questionb c'est voulez-vous, voulez-vous.

And here we go again, we know the start,
we know the end, masters of the scene.
We've done it all before and now we're back
to get some more, you know what I mean.

Voulez-vous, take it now or leave it,...

Voulez-vous ah, aha, aha,
Voulez-vous ah, aha, aha,
Voulez-vous ah, aha, aha,
Voulez-vous ah, aha, aha.

Voulez - vous, take it now or leave,...
