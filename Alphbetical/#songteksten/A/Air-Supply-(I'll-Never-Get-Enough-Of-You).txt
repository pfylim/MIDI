All last night we lay in bed making love
I never felt so much before with anyone
never had to say a word
it was all right there
the warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere.

And if I never have another love
well at least I had last night
now I know how the feeling grows
'cause you made me come alive.

I'll never get enough, never get enough
never get enough of you
I'll never get enough, never get enough
never get enough of you
I only wanna give you more.

Now you're gone, I'm alone just lying here
waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near
never asked if you'd come back,
I'm too damn proud
I just smiled and touched your hair
as you went out.

I'll never get enough, never get enough
never get enough of you
I'll never get enough, never get enough
never get enough of you
I only wanna give you more.
