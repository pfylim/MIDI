Here I am again
I've come to see your smile
I know you understand
I have to say again
it's only for a while.

And still you're always here
just waiting for my call
I wish I knew a way
to give more than I do
I want to give it all.

It doesn't happen every day
but it happened to me once before
those early years I threw away
now I only have to hear your voice
to make me feel so sure
that your love is why
I want to give it all.

Don't the minutes fly
and hours just seem so few
with days apart so long
it's hard to spend my time
when I'm so far from you.

And still you're always here
just waiting for my call
I wish I knew a way
to give more than I do
I want to give it all.

It doesn't happen every day
but it happened to me once before
those early years I threw away
now I only have to hear your voice
to make me feel so sure
that your love is why
I want to give it all.
