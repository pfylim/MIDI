BLUE BAYOU - LYNN ANDERSON

I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all of the time
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou.

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou.

I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks have fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with the sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise 
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be.

Gonna to see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou.

Saving nickels saving dimes
Working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou.

I'm going back some day
Come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks have fun
And the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with the sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise 
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be.

With that boy of mine by my side
The silver moon and the evening tide
So sweet a day 
Could take away
This hurting inside
I'll never be blue
My dreams come true
On Blue Bayou
