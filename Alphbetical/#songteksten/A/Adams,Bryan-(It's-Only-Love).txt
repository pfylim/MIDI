When the feeling is ended 
there ain't no use pretending
don't you worry oh it's only love.
When your world has been shattered
ain't nothin' else matters
it ain't over, oh, it's only love,
and that's all, yeah yeah !
when your heart has been broken,
hard words have been spoken,
it ain't easy, but it's only love,
and if your life ain't worth livin',
and you're ready to give in
just remember that it's only love (love.

You can live, without the aggravation,
you gotta wanna win,
you gotta wanna win,
you keep looking back in desperation
over and over and over again.
When your world is shattered
and nothin' else matters
it ain't over, it's only love.
If your life ain't worth livin',
and you're ready to give in,
just remember that it's only love.
Yeah ! That's all.
It's only love and that's all.
