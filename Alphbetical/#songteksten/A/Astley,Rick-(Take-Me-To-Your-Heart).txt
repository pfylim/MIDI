RICK ASTLEY - TAKE ME TO YOUR HEART

Are we lovers, or only just friends
Come tomorrow, will be lonely again
When you see me, is it love in your eyes
What you're feeling, deep down inside

Do you think about me (think about me)
when I'm far away
Do you dream about me (dream about me)
Can I find a way
To make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cause I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too

Refrain:
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
If you knew what I'm feeling
You would not say no
Take me to your heart
Never let me go
For your love for your love
Is all I need to know

Can you tell me, when you look at me
If you need me, in all honesty
Because I am certain as sure as can be
I'd make you happy, eternally

'Cause I think about you (think about you)
when you're far away
And I dream about you (dream about you)
Night and day
Can I make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cause I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too

refrain: ...2x...

'Cause I think about you (think about you)
when you're far away
And I dream about you (dream about you)
Night and day
Can I make you want me (make you want me)
The way that I want you
'Cause I think I love you (think I love you)
Could you love me too

refrain: ...
