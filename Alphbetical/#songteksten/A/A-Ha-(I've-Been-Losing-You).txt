A-HA - I'VE BEEN LOSING YOU

(Words & music: Pal Waaktaar)

It wasn't rain that washed away
Rinsed out the colors of your eyes
Putting the gun down on the bedside table
I must have realized
It wasn't the rain that made no difference
And I could have sworn it wasn't me
Yet I did it all so coldly almost slowly
Plain for all to see

Oh come on please now talk to me
Tell me things I could find helpful
How can I stop now is there nothing I can do
I have lost my way
I've been losing you

I can still hear our screams competing
You're hissing your s's like a snake
Now in the mirror stands half a man
I thought to one could break
It wasn't the rain that made no difference
Nervously drumming on run way

But I want the guilt to get me
Thoughts to wreck me preying on my mind

So please now talk to me
Tell me things I could find helpful
How can I stop now there is nothing I can do
I have lost my way
I've been losing you

Please now talk to me
Tell me things I could find helpful
How can I stop now is there nothing I can do
Please naow talk to me
Tell me oh tell me what to do (helpful)
Oh how can I stop now
Is there nothing I can do
I have lost my way
I've been losing you you
I've been losing you you
I've been losing you
