6. THE ONLY THING LOOKS GOOD - BRYAN ADAMS

Well I don`t look good
In Armadi suits.
No goodshaped shoes
Or designer boots.
I`ve tried the latest lines
From A to Z.
But there`s just one thing
That looks good on me.

Chorus
The only thing I want.
The only thing I need.
The only thing I choose.
The only thing that looks good on me
Is you.

I`m not satisfied 
With the satchest style.
Put those pattern leather pants
In the circular file.
Sometimes I think 
I might be looking good
But there`s only one thing
That fit`s like it should.

Chorus

Yeah it`s you.
It could only be you.
Nobody else will ever do.
Yeah baby it`s you.
Elastic too.
Yeah we`ll stick like glue.

Chorus 2x

The only thing I want.
Oh yeah.
The only thing that looks good on me
Is you.
You you you.
The only thing that looks good on me
Is you.
The only thing I want.
The only thing I need.
