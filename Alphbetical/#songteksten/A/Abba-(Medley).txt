Voulez Vous
Take it now or leave it
Now it's all we get
Nothing promised, no regret
Voulez Vous

So when you leave me darling, can't you hear me S.O.S.
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I ever try to go on...

Like a Bang - A - Boome-Boomerang, Damm, dam dam dam
Bang A Boome-Boomerang, Love is untrue
You hug me, I'm hunt

Money, money, money,
Must be funny in the rich men's world
Money, money, momney, always sunny
In the rich men's world
Ah, ah all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich men's world.

Knowing me, knowing you
There's nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you
Ah, ah we just have to face
It's time we're through
Breaking up is never easy
I know, but I have to go,
Knowing me knowing you
Is the best we can do.


There was something in the air, last night 
The stars were dry, Fernando
There were shining there for you and me, for liberty
Fernando

I don't wanna talk
About the things we've gone through
Though it's hurtin' me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play
The winner takes it all
The looser's standing small
Beside the victory, that's our destiny.

Super Trouper, beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue, like I always do
'cause somewhere in the crowd there's you


The stars on 45, Keep on turnin' in your eyes
But we can work it out, remember Twist & Shout
You still don't tell me why
Knowin' why, why, why
