Singer : THE IMPERIALS 
Title  : WHO'S GONNA LOVE ME

(Words & music: Glen Davidson)

Oo oo oo oo oo oo, baby
Who is gonna love me when you go?
Who is gonna love me, let me know

I know I haven't always been true
But I never meant you no harm
If you'll just promise to stay with me
I'll never ever leave your arms

Who's gonna love me when you go
Who's gonna need me, I've got to know

I've got my future to think of
Where will I go what will I be
If you'll just give me one more chance
I'll be a changed man you'll see

Who's gonna love me when you go
Who's gonna need me, I've got to know
