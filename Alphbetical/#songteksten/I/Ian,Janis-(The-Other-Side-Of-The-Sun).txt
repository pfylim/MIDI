Title  : THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SUN
Artist : JANIS IAN

(Words & music: Janis Ian/Albert Hammond)

Leaving on a boat
For beyond the other side of the ocean
Bet you in the morning
You won't even know I'm gone
Tired of living here
In the middle of a mixed emotion
Might as well be living
On the other side of the sun

Chorus:
Leaving with the feeling
I don't know how I'm dealing
With loving you
Though once I knew
The special way
And what to do
To make you stay
Forever and ever
Even as I'm leaving 
I'll never stop believing
You are the one
Who can make me laugh
And can bring me back
From beyond the other side of the sun

Rolling down the river
I hope I can deliver the morning
Wishing on a star
For the sun to come out to play
Funny, when it's over
You really don't remember the warning
Might as well be living
Out beyond the milky way

Chorus: ...
