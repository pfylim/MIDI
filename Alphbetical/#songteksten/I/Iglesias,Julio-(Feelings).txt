         Feelings                     Julio Iglesias 


I     Feelings nothing more than feelings ,
      trying to forget my feelings of love .
      Teardrops rolling down on my face ,
      trying to forget my feelings of love .

II    Feelings , for all my life I feel it .
      I wish I never met you , girl ; you'll never come again .
      Feelings , wo wo wo , feelings , wo wo wo , feel you again in my arms

III   Feelings , feelings like I've never lost you .
      and feelings like I'll never have you again in my heart ( life ) .

IV    Feelings , for all my life I feel it .
      I wish I've never met you , girl : you'll never come again .
