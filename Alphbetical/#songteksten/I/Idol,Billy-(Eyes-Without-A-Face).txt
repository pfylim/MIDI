BILLY IDOL - EYES WITHOUT A FACE

I'm all out of hope, one more bad break
could bring a fall
When I'm far from home don't call me on
the phone to tell me you're alone
It's easy to deceive it's easy to tease
But hard to get release

Refrain:
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage) eyes without a face
Eyes without a face got no human grace
Your eyes without a face

I spend so much time believing all the lies
To keep the dream alive
Now it makes me sad it makes me mad
At truth for lovin' what was you

Refrain: ...

You hear the music you make a dip into
someone else's pocket
Then make a slip steal a car and go to
Las Vegas or the Gigolo pool
I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip reading
murder books trying to stay hip
I'm thinking of you you're out there to say
your prayers say your prayers

Now I close my eyes and I wonder why I
don't despise
Now all I can do is love what was once
so alive but new
But it's gone from your eyes I'd better realize

Refrain: ...

Such a human waste your eyes without a face
And now it's gettin' worse
