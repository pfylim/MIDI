Talkin' about you and me yeah
And the games people play

All the game people play now
Every nite and every day now
Never meaning what they say yeah
Never say what they mean
First you wind away your hours
in your concrete towers
Soon you'll be covered up in flowers
In the back of a black limousine
People wakin' up to you
Singin' glory hallelujah
Then they try to sock it to you
In the name of the Lord

Na na na na 
Talkin' about you and me yeah
And the games people play

Then they teach you how to meditate
Read your horoscope and change your fate
And further more to hell with hate
come on and give me some more

Turn around and look what you see
What is happening to you and me
God grant me the serenity yeah to remember who I am
First you given upyour sanity for your pride and
Your vanity turn back on humanity yeah
And you don't give a damn
