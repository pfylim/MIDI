Title  : SWEET LUI-LOUISE

(Words & music: Randy Bachman)

I know you've been out runnin'
When you've done all your runnin'
Run to me
I know you love your lovin'
And when you're done with all your lovin'
Come to me

Chorus: 
My sweet Louise, my sweet Louise
Sweet, sweet Lui-Louise
My sweet Louise
My sweet Louise
My sweet Louise
Sweet Lui-Lui-Louise, sweet Louise

I know at night you're dreamin'
And when you wake up from your dreamin'
Come to me
Find things to believe in
And when you live what you believe in
Come to me

Chorus: ...

You're spinnin' round in circles
When your life comes full circle
Come to me
Look for new directions
And if you come in my direction
Please stay with me

Chorus: ...
