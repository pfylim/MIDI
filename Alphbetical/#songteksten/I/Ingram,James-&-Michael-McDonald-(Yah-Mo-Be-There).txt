JAMES INGRAM & MICHAEL MCDONALD - YAH MO BE THERE

Heavenly father watching us fall
We take from each other and give nothing at all
Well, it's a dog-gone shame
But never too late for change
So if your luck runs out
Just reach out and call his name
His name

Yah mo b there
Yah mo b there up and over
Yah mo b there
Yah mo b there up and over
Whenever you call

Never be lonely, lost in the night
Just run from the darkness, looking for the light
'Cause it's a long hard road
That leads to a brighter day
(Hey) don't let your

Yah mo b there
You can count on it, brother
'Cause we're all just finding our way
Trav'ling thru time
Peddle got to keep pushing on
No matter how
Many dreams slip away
Yah mo b there (2x)
