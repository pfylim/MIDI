Title  : DON'T LET HIM GO
Artist : IMAGINATION

(Words & music: Kevin Cronin)

So you figure that you've got him
All figured out
He's a sweet talking stud
Who can melt a girl's heart with his pout
He's the kind of lover that the ladies dream about

He's got plenty of cash, he's got plenty of friends
He drives women wild
Then he drives off in Mercedes Benz
He's got a long wick, with a flame at both ends

Chorus:
But don't let him go
Jut give him a chance to grow
Take it easy, take it slow
And don't let him go

He makes you so angry, he makes you so sore
The weight may be worth it
But how can you wait anymore
When you're wondering what you're waiting for

Chorus: ...
