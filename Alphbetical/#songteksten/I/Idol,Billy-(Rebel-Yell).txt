Last night a little  dancer
came dancing to my door.
Last night my little angel
came pumping on the floor.
She said, 'Oh come baby 
I got a licence for love,
and if it expires pray help from above,'
because in the midnight hour 
she cried more, more, more,
with a rebell yell she cried more, more, more.
In the midnight hour babe, more, more, more.
With a rebell yell more, more, more
more, more, more.

She don't like slavery,
she won't sit and beg,
but when I'm tired and lonely,
she sees me to bed.
What set you free 
and brought you to me babe ?
What set you free ?
I need you here by me,
because in the midnight hour 
she cried more, more, more,
with a rebell yell she cried more, more, more.
In the midnight hour babe, more, more, more.
With a rebell yell more, more, more

I think he lives in his own heaven,
collects it to go from the Seven Eleven.
Well he's out all night to collect the fare,
just so long,just so long it don't
mess up his hair.
I walked the wall for you babe.
A thousand miles for you.
I dried your tears of pain 
a million times for you,
I'd sell my soul for you babe.
For money to burn for you.
I'd give you all and have none babe.
Justa justa justa justa to have you here by me.
because in the midnight hour 
she cried more, more, more,
with a rebell yell she cried more, more, more.
In the midnight hour babe, more, more, more.
With a rebell yell more, more, more,
more, more, more, more,   more.
