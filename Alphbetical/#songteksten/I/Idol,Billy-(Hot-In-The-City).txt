BILLY IDOL - HOT IN THE CITY

(Stranger, stranger, stranger, stranger)
It's hot here at night
Lonely black and quiet on a hot summer night
Don't be afraid of the world we've made
Oh a hot summer night
'Cause when a long legged lovely walks by
Yeah you can see the look in her eye
Then you know that it's hot in the city
Hot in the city tonight (tonight)
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight (tonight)

(Stranger, stranger)
For all the dreams and schemes
People are as they seem
On a hot summer night
Don't be no fun
Don't forget you're young
On a hot summer night
A sometime someone you're not
Don't wait to see what you've got

'Cause you know that you're hot in the city
Hot in the city tonight (tonight) alright
Hot in the city, hot in the city tonight (tonight)
Well I walk until my feet drop
I'm a train when I'm hateful
Yeah lay it right down now
And I'll ride until your head breaks
I'll walk until my brain pops
And I'll move with the beat now
I'm a train when I'm hateful
And I really feel the heat now New York
Hot in the city hot in the city tonight (tonight)
