Only seventeen and a dancing queen
I was dancing all night on a party
Saw him standing there
He had long black hair
He smiled at me and oh I felt so happy

Refrain:
Then he kissed my hand 
And took me for a dance
And told me that he loved me
While the stars were shinin' above
We were young and in love
We were young and in love
We were young and in love

When he walked me home
We were all alone
Then he said hey won't you be my lady
He looked in my eyes
I was in paradise
Yes I do I wanna be your baby
He kisses me oh so long
Call you on the phone
And tell you that I love you

Refrain: ...

Be my baby tonight
Be my baby tonight
Squeeze and hold me tight
Squeeze and hold me tight

Had an exciting week
I couldn't get much sleep
I was only waiting for my lover
And when we met again
He was the same sweet man
And there's a lot now what we can discover
Then he kisses my hand
And took me for a dance
And told me that he loves me

Refrain: ...
