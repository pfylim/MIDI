        Begin the Beguine


When they begin the Beguine
it brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour 
it brings a memory evergreen.

I`m with you once more under the stars,
and down by the shore an orchestra's playing.
And even the palms seem to be swaying.
When they begin the Beguine.

To live it again is past all endavour.
Except when that tune cluches my heart,
and there we are swearing to love for ever,
and promising never, never to part.

What moments divine what rapture severe,
till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
and now I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean:

So don't let them begin the Beguine,
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember,
Let it sleep like sire I only remember
When they begin the Beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the Beguine, make them play
till the stars that were there above you, 
till you whisper to me once more,
"Darling, I love you!"

And we suddenly know what heaven we're in,
when they begin the Beguine,
when they begin the Beguine.
