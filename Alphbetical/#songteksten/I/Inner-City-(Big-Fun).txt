INNER CITY - BIG FUN

(Words & music: ...)

We don't really need a crowd
To have a party
Just a funky beat
And you to get it started
An' oh oh oh oh oh oh
We'll dance the night away

We're having big fun
The party's just begun
Yeah-eah hey
We're having big fun
Big fun

It won't take a lot of thought
For you to do it
You just feel the groove
And baby then you're moving
An' oh oh oh oh oh oh
Dance the night away

Refrain:
We're having big fun
The party's just begun
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
We're having big fun
Big fun

I think you're ready ready ready
Now it's time to join the party baby
Let's get down into the groove
It can make your body move
Oh oh oh oh oh oh tonight

Refrain: ...

We're having big fun
The party's just begun
Yeah-eah hey
We're having big fun
Big fun

We're having big fun
The party's just begun
Yeah-eah hey
We're having big fun
We're having big fun
The party's just begun
