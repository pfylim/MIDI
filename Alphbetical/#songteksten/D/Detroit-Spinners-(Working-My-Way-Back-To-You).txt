Title  : WORKING MY WAY BACK TO YOU

(Words & music: Sandy Linzer/Denny Randell)

chorus:
I'll keep workin' my way back to you, babe
With the burnin' love inside
Yeah, I'm working my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away
Been payin' ev'ry day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
But how I cried over losin' you
Se me down and out
But I ain't about to go livin' my life without you
Yeah, ev'ry day I made you cry
I'll pay and girl till the day that I die

Chorus: ...

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
If I had been a man in reality
You'd be here baby, lovin' me
Now my nights are long
And lonely and I ain't too proud, babe
I just miss you so
Girl, but you're too proud you won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

Chorus: ...
