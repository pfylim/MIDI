1. MACARENA - LOS DEL RIO

When I dance they
Call me Macarena
Anybody say Que se buen na
They all want me
They can`t have me
So they all come and dance beside me.
Move with me
Chant with me.
If if you could
I take you home with me

Chorus
Al la cuquel par le gria Macarena
Cet tu quel pepa al la le gria cosa una
Al la cuquel par le gria Macarena
Ey Macarena.
Al la cuquel par le gria Macarena
Cet tu quel pepa al la le gria cosa una
Al la cuquel par le gria Macarena
Ey Macarena.

Now don`t you worry about my boyfriend.
The boy who`s name is Igorino.
I don`t want him.
`Cause then him
He was no good so I
Ha ha ha

Now come on
What was I supposed to do.
He was a retard
And his 2 friends
Where so fine.

Chorus 2 times

Come and find me
My name is Macarena.
I was at the party
Called La Chinqas `cause I`m  winner.
Come join me dance with me.
And you further chat along with me

Chorus repeat
