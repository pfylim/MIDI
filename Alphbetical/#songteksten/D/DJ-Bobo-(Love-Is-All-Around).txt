Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother and a child
See it in the eyes of a friend.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

My heart starts boom 
My arms feel weak
My head is exploding everyday of the week
Can't eat can't sleep
'Cause your body's so sweet
Put your hand to my heart
Can you feel the beat?
You don't want to full go
With that sexual healing
When I hold your hand
And I get this feeling
You're the only one
Feels so proud
Sweet sweet girl
Your love is all around.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother and a child
See it in the eyes of a friend.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

I'm dancing and I feel like flying
And I see this girl
She is crying
And I take her in my arms
It's like a dream
The most beautiful girl in the world I've seen
Look up to me
I see it in your eyes
The moment of truth
No more lies
It's love
Love at the first sight 
Like heaven on earth
It's shining bright.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother and a child
See it in the eyes of a friend.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother and a child
See it in the eyes of a friend.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.

Love is all around
Everywhere you look
Love is all around
See it in the eyes of a mother and a child
See it in the eyes of a friend.

Love is all around
Love is all around
Love is all around.
