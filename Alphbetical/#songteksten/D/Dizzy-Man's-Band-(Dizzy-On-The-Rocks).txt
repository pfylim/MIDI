Title  : DIZZY ON THE ROCKS

Well come on everybody
Come on and sing with the band
Oh yeah
I want you all to stand up
And get with it till the end
Oh yeah

Right come on

Well come on feel the rhythm
Raise your hands up high
Shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Swing and dance and sing
Until you feel alright
Take them up and down
Stamp your feet on the ground
Take them up put them down
Like the days we used to twist and shout

Well come on everybody
Come and make your pick
Oh yeah
Just act the way you want to
Then you get your kick
Oh yeah
Shake it to the left
Shake it to the right
Swing and dance and sing
Until you feel alright
Take them up and down
Stamp your feet on the ground
Take them up put them down
Like the days we used to twist and shout

Just a little bit softer (4x)
Just a little bit louder (4x)
