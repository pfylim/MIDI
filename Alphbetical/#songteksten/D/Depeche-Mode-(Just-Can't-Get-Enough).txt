DEPECHE MODE - JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH

When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough (2x)
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough (2x)
We slip and slide
As we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of ...

Refrain:
I just can't get enough (8x)

We walk together
Walking down the street
And I just can't get enough (2x)
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
It's getting harder
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of ...

Refrain: ...

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough (2x)
Just like a rainbows
You know you see me free
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
You're like an angel
And you give me you're love
and I just can't seem to get enough of ...

Refrain: ...
