Title  : Lover Come Back To Me
Singer : Dead Or Alive


I've been lying here so lonely
I've been wishing you would telephone me
Oh I just can't lose this desperation
Won't you bring around a new sensation

Baby you got lots of energy yeah gonna give that energy 
to me yeah
Tell you we could have a real good time yeah
Baby I could make you mine all mine yeah

Chorus:
Lover come back to me
You don't have to knock on my door, no
Lover come back to me
Kick it right down (3x)
Right down

Baby all I feel is desperation
And it's not a very nice sensation
I've been wishing you would telephone me
I've been lying here oh oh so lonely

Tell you we could have a real good time yeah
Tell you I could make you mine all mine yeah
Baby you got lots of energy yeah
Baby give that energy to me yeah

Chorus (2x)

I hear you knocking won't you run on in
I hear you knocking come back where you been
I hear you knocking won't you run on in
I hear you knocking come back where you been

Chorus
