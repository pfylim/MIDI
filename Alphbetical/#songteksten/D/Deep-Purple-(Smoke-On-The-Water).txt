We all came out to Montreux
on the Lake Geneva shoreline.
To make records with the mobile,
we didn't have much time.
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
were at the best place around.
But some stupid with a flare gun
burned the place to the ground.

Smoke on the water and fire in the sky,
smoke on the water.

They burned the gambling house,
it died with an awful sound,
and Funky Claude was running in and out
pulling kids out the ground.
When it all was over we had to find another place.
But Swiss time was running out,
it seemed that we would lose the race.

Smoke on the water and fire in the sky,
smoke on the water.

It was empty cold and bare.
But with the rolling truck
stones thing just outside, yeah !
Making our music there.
with a few red lights a few old beds,
we made a place to sweat.
no matter what we got out of this.
I know, I know we'll never forget.

Smoke on the water and fire in the sky,
smoke on the water.
