10. BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY`S - DEEP BLUE SOMETHING

You‹ll say; we got nothing in common.
No common ground to start from, 
And we‹re falling apart.
You‹ll say the world has come between us
Our lifes have come between us.
Still I know you just don‹t care.
Refrain
And I say what about
Breakfast at Tiffany‹s,
She said I think I remember the film.
I, yes I recall, I think 
We both kinda liked it.
And I said well that‹s
The one thing we got.
I see you the only one who knew me.
Now your eyes see through me.
I guess I was wrong.
So what now,
It‹s plain to see we‹re over.
And I hate when things are over.
So much is left undone.
Refrain
They say that we`ve got
Nothing in common.
No common ground to start from, 
And we‹re falling apart.
You‹ll say the world has come between us,
Our lifes have come between us.
Still I know you just don‹t care.
Refrain
