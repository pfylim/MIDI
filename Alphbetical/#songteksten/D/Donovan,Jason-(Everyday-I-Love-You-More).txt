                           EVERY DAY I LOVE YOU MORE

     As performed by: Jason Donovan          


     Oh, every day,...oh, every day,...
     oh, every day,....................

     I may never give you flowers,
     I may be working all these hours
     to build a life.....for me and you...

     I may never seem to show affection,
     please don't take this as rejection,
     'cause everything I do,.....I do for you...

     But even if I don't show you how I feel...

     Oh, every day.....my love is stronger...
     and every day, in every way, I love you more.....

     I may be working overtime 
     but that don't change this heart of mine,
     it's always true,...it's only me and you...

     I may always seem to say goodbye
     but that don't change my one desire,
     to be with you,...to be with you...

     Don't you know by now my love is real?...

     Oh, every day.....my love is stronger...
     and every day, in every way, I love you more.....

     Oh, every day,...oh, every day,...
     oh, every day, (in every way, I love you more).....

     SOLO..................................................
     ............................................

     But even if I don't show you how I feel...

     Oh, every day.....my love is stronger...
     and every day, in every way, I love you more.....

     Oh, every day.....my love is stronger...
     and every day, in every way, I love you more.....

     Oh, every day.....my love is stronger...
     and every day, in every way, I love you more.....
