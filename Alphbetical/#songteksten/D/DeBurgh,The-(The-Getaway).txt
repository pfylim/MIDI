The moon is on the bright side
but we've thought of everything
send the wordto the prisoners
tonight, we getaway

When you hear signs of confusion
come drifting through the door
get your belongings together
don't leave nothing behind

And hey boys tonight we geataway
to the other side
head for the wall and getaway

We're sick and tired of hearing that the world is gonna blow
so there's something we'll do to the leaders
before we go

Let's stick'em in a room together - Yeah !! -
and make them fight it out
until they see nothing from nothing
will leave nothing at all

And hey boys tonight we geataway
to the other side
head for the wall and getaway

And hey boys tonight we geataway
to the other side
head for the wall and getaway

Open the door - open the door - let me out - I wanna go -

Das ist auch unzere welt
this is our world too
oui c'est notre monde aussi

And hey boys tonight we geataway
to the other side
head for the wall and getaway

"We'll give you anything you say"

And hey boys tonight we geataway
to the other side
head for the wall and getaway

"We'll miss you more than we can say"
