I love you , words don't come easy .

Words don't come easy to me
This is the only way for me to say 
I love you , words don't come easy .

Well I'm just a music man ,
Melodies so far my best friend ,
But my words are coming all wrong ,and I
I reveal my heart to you and
Hope that you believe it's true , cause

Words don't come easy to me 
How can I find a way to make you see ,
I love you ,  words don't come easy .

This is just a simple song 
That I've made for you on my own ,
There's no help in meeting you know and I
When I say I love you honey
Please believe I really do , cause
