Song sung blue everybody knows one
Song sung blue every garden grows one
me and you are subject to the blues now an' then
but when you take the blues and make a song
You sing them out again sing'em out again

Song sung blue weepin' like a willow
Song sung blue sleepin' on my pillow
Funny thing but you can sing it with a cry in your voice
and before you know it start to feelin' good
You simply got no choice
