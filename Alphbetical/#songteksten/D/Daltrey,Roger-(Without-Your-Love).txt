Title  : WITHOUT YOUR LOVE
Artist : ROGER DALTREY

(Words & music: Roger Daltrey)

You can show me the way
Give me a sunny day
But what does it mean without your love

If I could travel far
If I could touch the stars
Where would I be without your love?

Whenever I get to feel
Down and out
I think about what you said
And then I give up

If I could fly away
If I could sail today
Where would I go without your love?

And if I ever wander
Away too far
You come-a looking for me
With open arms
