Mr. Tambourine Man - BOB DYLAN


Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip up on your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped
My hands can't feel to stripped
My toes too numb to step
Wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it.

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you
