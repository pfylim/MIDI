Pilot of the airwaves here is my request
You don't have to play it, but I hope you'll do your best
I've been list'ning to your show on the radio
And you seem like a friend to me.

Any record of your choise I don't mind
I'd be happy just to hear your voice
Saying this is for the girl who didn't sign her name
Guess she needs a dedication just the same
Late at night I'm still listening don't waste my time chasing sleep
People say I look weary but that's just the company I keep

You make the night time race
I don't need to see your face
Your sounding good - you're sounding good to me

Play that song for me once again
Play that song for me
Play that song once again
Play that song, ...
