DOLLY DOTS - GIVE THE GIRL A BREAK

You check up on ev'rything that I say and do
You check out ev'ry lover that I knew
Did you think that my life began with you?
Won't cha give a girl a break
(Give a girl a break)

You believe in rumors you hear of me
You got a wild imagination and it's runnin' free
And you're makin' my life a misery
Won't cha give a girl a break
(Give a girl a break)

Don't ya know it's not cool to hound me
All I wanted was your arms around me
But now I'm wishin' that you'd never found me
I'll make it easy on your mind
Because I'm leavin' you behind

I believe that livin' well is the best revenge
And I've learned to say adieu when a romance ends
'Cause I've learned to judge a man by the love he spends
Won't cha give a girl a break

Won't cha give a girl a break
And pardon my mistake for wastin' all your time
But here's the bottom line I'm leaving on the five-o-two
And so long bye bye bye bye to you

Give a girl a break (bye bye)
Yeah give a girl a break (ta ta)
Give a girl a break (so long)
Give a girl a break
