Singer : JOEY DYSER 
Title  : 100 YEARS

The other day I felt so young
But now you made me hundred years
If you turn round
Look what you've done
You'll see it in my eyes
You'll see it in my tears

Refrain:
My friends all said
Don't cry too long
There is another love to come
They maybe right
They maybe wrong
But still I love you hear my song

You disappeared without goodbye
Knowing so well you'd make me cry
But troubles you could never face
So you just left an empty place

Refrain: ...

The first kiss made a fool of me
It stuck me blind I couldn't see
For you this love was just the same
I am asking now am I to blame

Refrain: ...
