Title  : LISTEN TO THE MUSIC

Don't you feel it growing
Day by day
People, getting ready for the news
Some are happy some are sad
Oh, we got to let the music play

What the people need
Is a way to make 'em smile
It ain't so hard to do
If you know how
Gotta get a message
Get it on through
Oh now mama's going
To after a while

Refrain:
Oh oh listen to the music
Oh oh listen to the music
Oh oh listen to the music
All the time

Well I know you know better
Everything I say
Meet me in the country for a day
We'll be happy and we'll dance
Oh we're gonna dance the night away

Refrain: ...

And if I'm feeling good to you
And you're feeling good to me
There ain't nothing
We can't do or say
Feeling good, feeling fine
Oh, baby let the music play

Refrain: ...

Like a lazy flowing river
Surrounding castles in the sky
And the crowd is growing bigger
Listening to the happy sounds
And I got to let them fly

Refrain: ...
