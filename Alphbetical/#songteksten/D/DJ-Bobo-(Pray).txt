1. Strophe
Bbm
What has happened to paradise?

Emotion all paralysed.

Isolation - imigration,
Gb              Ab
Frustration all over the nation.
Bbm
We`ve been wasting most of our time

Turn about things and there`s no sign.

Recognize, heed the advice.
     Gb                Ab
It`s more than only an exercise.
  Bbm
A third of the world so far away
      Db
Where people stay and pray ev`ry day.
     Ab
They have their hopes

They have their chance.
Eb
Pray for peace and tell us then.
  Bbm
Remember our past in paradise.
  Db
A system without any compromise.
Ab
Let me say we can find a way
      Eb
Stand up for the rules and pray.

Bbm
What has happened to paradise?

Has it turned to a world

Of sorrow and lies?

So many people don`t give up the boose.

Honest people seem to be the fools.

Close your eyes and let it end.

Where people stay and pray ev`ry day.

And so they went.
