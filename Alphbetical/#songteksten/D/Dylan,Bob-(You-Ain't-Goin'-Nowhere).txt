Titel:  You Ain't Goin' Nowhere
Artist: Bob Dylan

Clouds so swift, rain won't lift,
Gates won't close, the railing's froze.
Get your mind off winter time,
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus:

Oooo, Eeeee, Ride me high,
One of these days my man's gonna come.
Oh Lord, we gonna fly,
Down in the easy chair.

I don't care how many letters they sent,
Morning came and morning went.
Pick up your money and pack your tent,
But we still ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus...

Buy me a flute and a gun that shoots,
Tailgates and substitutes,
Strap yourself with the tree with roots,
You ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus...

Ghengis Khan he could not keep
All his kings supplied with reap.
Climb that hill no matter how steep,
We still ain't goin' nowhere.

Chorus...
