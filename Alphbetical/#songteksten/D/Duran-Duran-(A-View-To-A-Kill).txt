Title  : A View To A Kill
Singer : Duran Duran


Meeting you with a view to a kill
Face to faces secret places feel the chill
Nightfall covers me
But you know the plans I'm making, still oversee
Could it be the whole earth opening wide
A sacred why
A mystery gaping your side
The weekend's why?

Until we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

Choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades
Assassination standing still
The first crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body
The first time in years
To drench your skin with lovers' rosy stain
A chance to find a phoenix for the flame
A chance to die
But can we dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
When all we see is the view to a kill
