---------------------------------------------------------------------

Where d'ya think you're going
don't you know it's dark outside.
Where d'ya think you're going
don't you care about my pride.
Where d'ya think you're going
I think a you don't know
you got no way of knowing
there's really no place you can go.

I understand your changes
a-long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going you
I know what you came here for
and now I'm sick of joking
you know I like you to be free
a-where d'ya think ya going
I think you better go with me girl

You say there is no reason
but still find cause to doubt me
if you ain't with me girl
you're gonna be without me.

Where d'ya think you're going
don't you know it's dark outside.
Where d'ya think you're going
I wish I didn't care about my pride.
And now I'm sick of joking
you know I like you to be free
a-where d'ya think ya going
I think you better go with me girl
ay he got something to say.
