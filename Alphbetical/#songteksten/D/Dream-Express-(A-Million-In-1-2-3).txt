Singer : DREAM EXPRESS 
Title  : A MILLION IN 1, 2, 3

(Words & music: Smets)

Need a million in one two three
Can't you do a little word for me
Mister President can't you see
I'll never gonna get higher

Refrain:
Need a million in one two three
I'm not too clumsy as you can see
I've got the feeling inside of me
Feel my need and desire now

I've got the look but never got the money
Just a ten quid flat on a second floor
I had a dream holiday in Cannes
A yacht in Monte Carlo next to his (do do)

Joining your big company
Could bring me wealth and sympathy
Think you've got some extra needs hey hey hey

Refrain: ...

My bedroom wall's covered with glamour
The Lido in December would not be bad
Ships and sails, formula races
Super long drinks down at the playboyclub (di do)

Joining your big company
Could bring me wealth and sympathy
Think you've got some extra needs hey hey hey

Refrain: ...
