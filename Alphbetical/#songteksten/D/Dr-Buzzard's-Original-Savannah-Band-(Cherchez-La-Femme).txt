Title  : CHERCHEZ LA FEMME

(Words & music: Stony Browder Jr./August Darnell/Schonberger/

Tommy Mottola
Lives on the road
He lost his lady
Two months ago
Maybe he'll find her
Maybe he won't

He sleeps in the back of his grey Cadillac, oh my honey
Blowing his mind on cheap grass and wine so crazy baby
Guess you could say, the man has learned his lesson
Now he's alone, he's got no woman, no home
For misery, cherchez la femme

They'll tell a lie with a Colgate smile, baby
Love you one second and hate you the next one, crazy
All I can say, of one thing I am certain
They're all the same
The sluts and the saints
For misery, cherchez la femme
