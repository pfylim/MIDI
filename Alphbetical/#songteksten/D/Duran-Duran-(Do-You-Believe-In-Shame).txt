DURAN DURAN - DO YOU BELIEVE IN SHAME

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in shame?
If love can conquer all then why do we only feel the pain?

I heard you speak my name
Heard you singing the Stones
Maybe heard you laughing in a line of static on my telephone

So why your eyelids are closed
Inside a case of rust
And did you have to change all your poets fire into frozen dust

I've tried to justify it
To learn from your mistake
But where's the stupid lie that has to make
It's point with such a pointless waste
Come out

Do you believe in shame?
Do you believe in love?
And if they taste the same would you love again or abandon both?

I don't think I ever can believe my friend has gone
Keep saying it's alright I'm gonna bring you back
But I know I'm wrong

There's nothing I can say
There's nothing left to do
It's just that lately I feel so damn lonely
When I think of you

And it may seem selfish now
But I'll hold on to the memory
Until all this fear is washed away

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in life?
Cos I believe a little part of you inside of me will never die
Cos I believe a little part of you inside of me will never die
Yes I believe a little part of you inside of me will never die
