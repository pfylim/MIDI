One word, one heart, one night is all I want
one word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me

Midnight, and all is well
I hear the mission bell
out on the road nothing is moving
as I speed from town to town

Two hearts are beating fast
but they are still many miles apart
oh the moon was shining on a distant shore
burning like a fire in my heart
I've got to see her, I've got to say

One word, one heart, one night is all I want
one word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me
I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I am going to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
like a cannonball

Headlights are blazing through
turn on the radio, I hrear the news
hand on the wheel, foot on the floor
and on, and on, and on we go

This car is like friend
bring her the message that I want to send
oh the dawn was breaking and I saw the sun
burning like a fire on the bay
I'm nearly there now, I'm gonna say -

One word, one heart, one night is all I want
one word, one heart, one girl, is waiting there for me
I never knew I cared so much before
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I am going to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
like a cannonball

One word, (yes), one heart,
one night, (yes), one girl, (yes)
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I've got to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
I've got to give her my love  - straight to the heart
I've got to give her my love  - straight to the heart
I've got to tell her myself - straight to the heart
I'm going to tell her tonight - straight to the heart
