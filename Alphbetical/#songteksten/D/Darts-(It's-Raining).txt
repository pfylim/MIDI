Singer : DARTS 
Title  : IT'S RAINING 
 
(Words & music: I. Collier) 
 
Do, do, do 
It's raining, raining down on me 
Yeah, I'm drowning, I'm drowning in misery 
Yeah, I'm thinking that now I'm alone 
I just want to be going home 
I wish you were by me to hold me 
And help me pull through 
Girl, I'm crying, crying out to you 
And I'm hoping, hoping I'm getting through 
 
I've never been feeling so low 
But I can't let my pain ever show 
But from your eyes I have to hide 
These feelings inside 
 
That's why I'm crying (It's raining) 
That's why I'm saying 
It's raining, I'm crying, I'm sinking, I'm dying 
It's raining, I'm crying, I'm sinking, I'm dying 
Oh, I'm sinking (I'm sinking in the crowd) 
Sinking in the crowd 
Oh, I'm praying (I'm praying out loud) 
Praying out loud 
 
Well, there's ache in my soul never seen 
(Ache in my soul never seen) 
But I'll sit back, find myself something 
(Find myself something) 
Outside I play cool 
But inside I'm hurting for you, oh darling 
Outside I play cool 
But inside I'm hurting for you 
 
Oh, little darling
