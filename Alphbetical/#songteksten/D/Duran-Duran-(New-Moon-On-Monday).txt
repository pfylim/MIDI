DURAN DURAN - NEW MOON ON MONDAY

Shake up the picture the lizard mixture
With the dance on the eventide
You got me coming up with answers
All of which I deny
I said it again
But could I please rephrase it
Maybe I can catch a ride
I couldn't really put it much plainer
But I'll wait 'til you decide
Send me your warning siren
As if I could ever hide
Last time la luna
I light my torch and wave if for the

Refrain:
New moon on monday
And a fire dance through the night
I stayed the cold night with a lonely satellite

Refrain: ...

Breaking away with the best of both worlds
A smile you can't disguise
And every minute I keep finding
Clues that you leave behind
Save me from these reminders
As if I'd forget tonight
Last time la luna
I light my torch and wave if for the

Refrain: ...(2x)...

I light my torch and wave if for the

Refrain: ...(2x)...

New moon on monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold night with a lonely satellite
(Wave it for the) New moon on monday
And a fire dance through the night
(Fire dance through the night)
I stayed the cold night with a lonely satellite
(Wave it for the) New moon on monday
And a fire dance through the night
