JIM DIAMOND - I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER

Refrain:
And I should have known better
To lie to one as beautiful as you
Yeah, I should have known better
To take a chance on ever losing you
But I thought you'd understand
Can you forgive me

I saw you walking by the other day
I know that you saw me
You turned away and I was lost
You see I've never loved no-one as
much as you
I've fooled around but tell me now
Just who is hurting who

Refrain: ...

I should have known better (2x)

It's true
I took our love for granted all long
And trying to explain where I went wrong
I just don't know
I cry but tears don't seem to help me
carry on
Now there is no chance
You'll come back home got too much pride

Refrain: ...

I love you (3x)
Yeah, I should have known better
To lie to one as beautiful as you
