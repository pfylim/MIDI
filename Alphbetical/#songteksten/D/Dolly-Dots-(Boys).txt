Singer : DOLLY DOTS 
Title  : BOYS

(Words & music: Peter Bewley/Richard DeBois)

Did Tommy ask you for a date?
No, but I will hope and wait
He's the guy that I am after
All your dates have been disasters
So, he's the guy I'd like to know

I think I'm in love with Larry
Yeah, he's extra-ordinary
I love my new science teacher
Do you mean that icky creature?
Oh, I think I better go

Chorus:
We'll tell it all about boys
'Bout the way they talk
And 'bout the way they walk
We'll tell everything
We'll tell it all about boys
'Bout the way they look
And 'bout the way they kiss
About everything
Not everything
No, not everything

We're going out to boogie tonight
We'll party down and do it just right
You'll meet us there we'll be there at eight
So, Tom and John, Larry Pete and Ron
We're all having a date

Chorus: ...

I like to go out with Peter
He has got a red two seater
Better watch him when he's driving
He can go fast as lighting
Oh, then I think I won't go

I think I'm still in love with Larry
He's the guy I want to marry
I'm not sure about that teacher
Just forget that icky creature
Joe's the guy you ought to know

Chorus: ..
