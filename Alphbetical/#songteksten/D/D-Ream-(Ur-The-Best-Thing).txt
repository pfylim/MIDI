  11. UR THE BEST THING (D:REAM)
  
  MY SIMPLE HEART WILL LIVE AND LEARN
  I TOOK A CHANCE, AT THE PRICE MY SOUL WOULD BURN,
  INSIDE MY DESIRE
  I PUT THE QUESTION, DOWN ON MY KNEES
  NO PRETTY THOUGHTS THAT WOULD SATISFY MY NEEDS
  I NEED HOPE, GIVE ME HOPE
  SO THEN I RUN FROM HOME IN SEARCH OF FRIENDSHIPS
  THAT WOULDN'T LAST
  'COS THEY WEREN'T RIGHT NOT LIKE YOU
  
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD
  KIND OF FEELING I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AT LAST
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING, SEE ME THROUGH
  I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE,
  I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...
  AND STANDING HERE THEY PASSED ME BY
  THEY WERE WASTED, COLD AND EMPTY DEEP INSIDE,
  
  I WOULD HOPE, LET ME DIE HERE
  AND YOU MAY ASK WHERE ARE THEY NOW-JUST LOOK
  AROUND YOU
  LIFT YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE CROWD
  I KNOW NOW WHAT I DID'NT KNOW THEN
  MADE ME RUN FROM HOME IN SEARCH OF FRIENDSHIPS
  THAT WOULDN'T LAST
  THEY WEREN'T RIGHT NOT LIKE YOU
  
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD
  KIND OF FEELING I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AT LAST
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING, SEE ME THROUGH
  I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE,
  I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...
  
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING, YOU'RE THE BEST THING
  YOU'RE THE BEST THING, COME SEE ME THROUGH
  I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE,
  I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...
