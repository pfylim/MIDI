DOLLY DOTS - TRICK OF THE EYE

You look so good you could be in the movies
Maybe a centerfold in Playgirl
Breath in my ear, y'know you move me
And when we kiss my toes curl

I-I-I would follow you
A-a-anywhere but when I turn
Arou-ou-ound I find you're not there

I shut my eyes and fall asleep you're with me
We fit together like an egg and spoon
You whisper that you're never gonna leave me
But when I wake up no-one's in the room

Sh sh sh sh sh shake me up baby
T t t t t t t turn me around
Should I reach a conclusion that love's an illusion
An illusion

Why oh why oh why won't you be my guy
Are you just a phantom man
Why oh why oh why won't you be my guy

You're ev'rything I'd ever want in one boy
I wanna tell the world you're mine all mine
Are you true love or just a decoy
This thing could cause a girl to lose her mind

Sh sh sh sh sh shadow dance baby
L l l l l l like a will o' the wisp
Are you real or a ruse and is love an illusion
An illusion

Why oh why oh why won't you be my guy
Are you just a phantom man
Why oh why oh why won't you be my guy

Refrain:
Are you a trick of the eye
Just a trick of the eye
Are you a trick of the eye
Just a trick of the eye

Are you only a dream
Are you not what you seem
You look too good for a dream
You kiss too good for a dream

Refrain: ...

A a a a trick of the eye
