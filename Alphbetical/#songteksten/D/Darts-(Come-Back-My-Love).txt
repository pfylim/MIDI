Title  : COME BACK MY LOVE

(Words & music: Eddy Mansfield)

Come back my love, don't go away
Come back my love, come back to stay
I love you so well
I want you to know
I need your love so badly

You said goodbye
I wondered why
All because of these silly lies
I love you so well
I want you to know
I need your love so badly

Well everybody makes big mistakes in the romance
Now I'm asking you darling
Why don't you come back and give me a chance

Come back my love
Don't stay away
I need your loving everyday
I love you so, well
I want you to know
I need your love so badly
