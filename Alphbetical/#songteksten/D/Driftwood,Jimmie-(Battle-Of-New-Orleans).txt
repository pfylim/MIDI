In eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip
along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'.
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,
and we met the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.

We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
there wuzn't nigh as many as they wuz a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
on down the Mississipi to the Gulf of Mexico.

I looked down the river and we seed the British come,
there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drums.
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
while we stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.

We fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
there wuzn't nigh as many as they wuz a while ago.
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
on down the Mississipi to the Gulf of Mexico.
