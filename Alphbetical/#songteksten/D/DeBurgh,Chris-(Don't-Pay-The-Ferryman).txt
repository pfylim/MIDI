Titel:        DON'T PAY THE FERRYMAN

It was late at night on the open road,
speeding like a man on the run,
a lifetime spent preparing for the journey

He is closer now and the surch is on
reading from a map in the mind
yes there's the ragged hill,
and there's the boat on the river,

And when the rain came down
he heard a wild dog howl,
there were voices in the night - don't do it
voices out of sight - don't do it
too many men have failed before
whatever you do

Don't pay the ferryman
don't even fix a price
don't pay the ferryman
until he gets you to the other side

In the rolling mist then he gets on board
noe there'll be no turning back
beware that hooded old man at the rudder
and the lightning flashed, and the thunder roarde
and people calling out his name
and dancing bones that jabbered and a-moaned
on the water

And then the ferryman said
there is trouble ahead
so you must pay me now - don't do it
you must pay me now - don't do it
and still that voice came from beyond
whatever you do

Don't pay the ferryman
don't even fix a price
don't pay the ferryman
until he gets you to the other side

Don't pay the ferryman
don't even fix a price
don't pay the ferryman
until he gets you to the other side

Don't pay the ferryman
don't even fix a price
don't pay the ferryman
until he gets you to the other side

Don't pay the ferryman
don't even fix a price
don't pay the ferryman
until he gets you to the other side

Don't pay the ferryman !
