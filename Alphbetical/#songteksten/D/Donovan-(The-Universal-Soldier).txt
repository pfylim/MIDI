Titel:         THE UNIVERSAL SOLDIER

Interpret:     DONOVAN



He is five feet two and he's six feet four
he fights with missiles and with spears
and he's all of thirty one one and he's
only seventeen.
'sbeen a soldier for thousand years.

He's a Catholic, a Hindu, an atheist, a Jain,
a Buddhist and a Baptist and a Jew
and he knows he shouldn't kill and he
knows he always will.
Care for me, my friend and I will care for you.

And he's fighting for Canada, he's fighting for France,
he's fighting for the USA,
and he's fighting for the Russians, he's fighting for Japan,
and he thinks we put an end to war this way.

And he's fighting for democracy, he's fighting for the Reds,
he says it's for the peace of all,
he's the one who must decide, who's to live and who's to die,
and he never sees the writing on the wall.

And without him, how would Hitler kill the people at Dachau
without him Caesar would have stood alone,
he's the one who gives his body as a weapon of the war
and without him always killing can't go on.

He's the universal soldier, and he really is to blame,
his orders came from far away, no more;
they came from here and there, and you and me
ain't brothers, can't you see,
this is not the way we put an end to war !
