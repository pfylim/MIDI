            Give me a ticket for an airoplane

            I ain't got time to take the fast train

            Lonely days are gone, I'm a-going home

            My baby, she wrote me a letter


            I don't care how much money I gotta spend

            Got to get back to my baby

            Lonely days are gone, I'm a-going home

            My baby, she wrote me a letter


            WELL SHE WROTE ME A LETTER

            SAID SHE COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME NO  MORE

            LISTEN MISTER CAN'T YOU SEE I GOT TO GET BACK 

            TO MY BABY ONCE MORE,   ANY WAY
