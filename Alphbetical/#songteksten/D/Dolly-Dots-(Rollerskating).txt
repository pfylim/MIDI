Title  : ROLLERSKATING

(Words & music: R.A. Debois/P. van Asten)

Have you ever gone dancing
Where they're not only dancing
Look at that, they are skating

It looks just like a disco
But it's more than a disco
Look at that, they are skating
They are skating, rollerskating

We move to the music
You should see how we do it
Look at us, we are skating

Try to spin in the spotlight
Look at him, he's all right
Oh boy, watch him skating
Watch him skating, rollerskating

Chorus:
Don't be late and be sure
To wear your rollerskates
We'll be waiting at the gate
On our dates everyone is
Wearing rollerskates
Hurry up 'cause we can't wait

You all have to try it
We're sure you will like it
It's fun when you're skating

Once you know how to do it
There's not that much to it
It's fun to be skating
Skating, rollerskating
