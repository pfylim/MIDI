Title  : RUN BACK

(Words & music: Steve Elson/Dave Stephenson)

Looking out on the world, all I see
Shadows of a girl who meant so much to me
How I've tried to turn my back on that woman
But it seems the more I do, how I cry over you

Every night I lie awake I wanna phone
Forget the flight, wrong or right, I want you home
In my dreams all I see is that woman

Chorus:
Run back I'm missing you baby
I'm sad, it really did hurt me
Run back, make it up baby
While we still got time

Run back here I am waiting
I'm sad I can't wait forever
Don't try and take me for granted
Come and change your mind
As we still got time

Loneliness was never meant for you and me
We know we got to share a lot in harmony
Everyone can see you're my woman

Chorus: ...
