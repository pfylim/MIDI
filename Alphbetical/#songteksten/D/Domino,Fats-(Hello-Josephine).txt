Refrain: Hello Josephine how do you do
         do you remember me Baby like I remember you
         you used to laugh at me and I'm a fool for you
--------------------------------------------------------
1) I used to walk you home I used to hold your hand
   you used to use my umbrella everytime invivet
   you used to cry so much it was a cryin' shame
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain: Hello Josephine how do you do
         do you remember me Baby like I remember you
         you used to laugh at me and I'm a fool for you
--------------------------------------------------------
2) You used to live far beyonder by the railroad track
   when it rained you couldn't walk
   I used to lot you on my back
   now you tryin' to make it lean
   and it was lean fast night
