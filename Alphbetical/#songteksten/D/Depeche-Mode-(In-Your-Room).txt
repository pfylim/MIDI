  4. IN YOUR ROOM (DEPECHE MODE)
  
  
  IN YOUR ROOM
  WHERE TIME STANDS STILL
  OR MOVES AT YOUR WILL
  WILL YOU LET THE MORNING COME SOON
  OR WILL YOU LEAVE ME LYING HERE
  IN YOUR FAVOURITE DARKNESS
  YOUR FAVOURITE HALF-LIGHT
  YOUR FAVOURITE CONSCIOUSNESS
  YOUR FAVOURITE SLAVE
  
  IN YOUR ROOM
  WHERE SOULS DISAPPEAR
  ONLY YOU EXIST HERE
  WILL YOU LEAD ME TO YOUR ARMCHAIR
  OR LEAVE ME LYING HERE
  YOUR FAVOURITE INNOCENCE
  YOUR FAVOURITE PRIZE
  YOUR FAVOURITE SMILE
  YOUR FAVOURITE SLAVE
  
  I'M HANGING ON YOUR WORDS
  LIVING ON YOUR BREATH
  FEELING WITH YOUR SKIN
  WILL I ALWAYS BE HERE
  
  IN YOUR ROOM
  YOUR BURNING EYES
  CAUSE FLAMES TO ARISE
  WILL YOU LET THE FIRE DIE
  DOWN SOON
  OR WILL I ALWAYS BE HERE
  YOUR FAVOURITE PASSION
  YOUR FAVOURITE GAME
  YOUR FAVOURITE MIRROR
  YOUR FAVOURITE SLAVE
  
  I'M HANGING ON YOUR WORDS
  LIVING ON YOUR BREATH
  FEELING WITH YOUR SKIN
  WILL I ALWAYS BE HERE
