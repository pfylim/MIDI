      Too Many Broken Hearts        Jason Donavan
                                                                              
            
Last night you talked about leaving, I said I can't let you go,
It's not just emotional feeling I need you body and soul.
     
You give me one good reason to leave me,
I'll give you ten good reasons to stay,
You're the only one I belive in,
I'll be hurt, I'll be hurt if you walk away !

Too many broken hearts in the world,
There's too many dreams can be broken in two.
Too many broken hearts in the world,
So I won't give up the fight for you.

The world is full of lonely people,
Who never held on to love,
Last night I tried to reach you,
But somehow it wasn't enough.
So I said : Can't you wait a bit longer ?
I'll give you all that a lover should give,
It ain't my pride, but my love that is stronger,
I'll hurt, I'll hurt if you walk away !
