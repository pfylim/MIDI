Title  : WAKE UP

(Words & music: Ian Dury/Chas Jankel)

I come awake
With the gift for woman kind
You're still asleep
But the gift don't seem to mind
Rise on this occasion
Halfway up your back
Sliding down your baby
Touching your behind
You look so self-possessed
I won't disturb your rest
It's lovely when you're sleeping
But wide awake is best

Chorus:
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
I don't wanna wake you
I let the fancy take you
When you wake up and make love to me

You come awake
In a horny morning mood
And have a proper wiggle
In the naughty naked nude
Roll against my body
Get me where you want me
What happens next is private
It's also very rude
I'll go and get the post
And make some tea and toast
You have another sleep, love
It's me that needs it most

Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
Wake up and make love

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
