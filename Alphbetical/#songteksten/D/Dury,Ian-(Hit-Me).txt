Title  : HIT ME

(Words & music: Ian Dury/Chas Jankel)

In the deserts of Sudan
And the gardens of Japan
From Milan to Yucatan
Every woman every man

Hit me with your rhythmstick
Hit me, hit me
Je t'adore, ich liebe dich
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with your rhythmstick
Hit me slowly, hit me quick
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me

In the wilds of Borneo
And the vineyards of Bordeaux
Eskimo, arapaho
Move their body to and fro

Hit me with your rhythmstick
Hit me, hit me
Das ist gut, c'est fantastique
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with your rhythmstick
It's nice to be a lunatic
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me, hit me, hit me

In the dock of tiger bay
On the road to Mandalay
From Bombay to Santa Fee
Over the hills and far away

Hit me with your rhythmstick
Hit me, hit me
C'est si bon mm, ist es nicht
Hit me, hit me, hit me
Hit me with your rhythmstick
Two fat persons click, click, click
Hit me (22x)
