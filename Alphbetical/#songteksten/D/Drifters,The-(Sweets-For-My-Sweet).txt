If you wanted that star that shines so brightly,
to match the stardust in your eyes, 
Darling I would chase that bright star nightly,
and try to steal it from the sky.

And I would bring sweets for my sweet,
sugar for my honey,
your thirsty kiss thrills me so.
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey,
I'll never ever let you go.

If you wanted a dream to keep you smiling,
I'd tell the sandman you were blue,
and I'd ask him to keep that sand a pilin',
until your dreams would come true.

And I would bring sweets for my sweet,
sugar for my honey,
your thirsty kiss thrills me so.
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey,
I'll never ever let you go.

And if you wanted a love to last forever,
Darlin' I would send my love your way,
and my love would not last forever,
but forever and a day.

And I would bring sweets for my sweet,
sugar for my honey,
your thirsty kiss thrills me so.
Sweets for my sweet, sugar for my honey,
I'll never ever let you go.
