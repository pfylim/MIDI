TAYLOR DAYNE - PROVE YOUR LOVE

(Words & music: ...)

I've heard all about, what you can do
But I've got to know, is it true
You tell me to trust, what should I believe
You promise so much but talk is cheap

You can tell me that you're serious
But I've got to know for sure
You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before, so

Prove your love, gotta prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talking to mine

Boy I can feel, love's on the rise
A message revealed in your eyes
You know I can't wait to know your passion
It's getting late so take some action

'Cause you say that when you're through
I'll know baby I've been patient now
I'm ready to find out, so

Prove your love, gotta prove your love
If you want to be with me tonight
Show your stuff
'Cause words are not enough
I wanna hear your body talking to mine
