If you ever get to Trinidad
Hela di ladi lo
You should taste the rum they've got
Hela di ladi lo
They have got the limbo beat
Hela di ladi lo
It will get you off your feet
Hela hela ho

It's the sun and it's the rum which
Gets you in the mood for fun
Moonlight dancing all night long
Singing to a limbo song
Tell me is there more you need
You won't find it anywhere
We love Trinidad and the rum they've got
Hope you will like it too
We love Trinidad, it's the place for you

Chorus:
Oh we love Trinidad
Hela di ladi lo
And the rum they've got
Hela di ladi lo
Oh island in the sun
Hela di ladi lo
Go and you'll have fun
Hela hela ho

Watch a limbo show, it's the place to go
Dancing all night long
Where's the place they've got the rum
It's Trinidad, it's Trinidad
Where's the place with all the sun
It's Trinidad, it's Trinidad
Where you'll have fun

I'm o.k. and you're o.k. if you dance
The limbo every day
I nefver thought that I could dance so long
But all that rum sure makes you strong
Come with us and please join in
It's always hard when you begin
Join the limbo show
And before you know
You will steal the show

Chorus: ...
