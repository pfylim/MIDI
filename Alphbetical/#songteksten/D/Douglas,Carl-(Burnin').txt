(Words & music: M. Barkan)

Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love
Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love

I got to know how you feel
If the flame in your heart is real
I got to know if the spark
Gonna light up my world in the dark
I got to know where you stand
'Cause my heart's in the palm of your hand
I got to feel that you care
'Cause the heat's gettin' too hot to bear

I'm burnin', burnin', burnin' up
Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love
Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love

I got to say what I need
That I'll follow where ever you lead
I got to give all I got
'Cause the temper turns hotter than hot
You got the touch that set the fire
Now I sizzle and shake with desire
I got to know what to do
'Cause I'm burnin' up with love over you

I'm burnin', burnin', burnin' up
Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love
Burnin', burnin', burnin' with love
