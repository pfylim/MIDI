  5. COUNTRY ROADS - JOHN DENVER
  
  Almost heaven, West Virginia,
  Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
  Life is old there, older than the trees,
  Younger than the mountains, growin' like a breeze.
  
  Country roads, take me home
  To the place I belong: West Virginia,
  Mountain momma, Take me home Country Roads.
  
  All my mem'ries gather 'round her,
  Miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
  Dark and dusty, painted on the sky,
  Misty taste of moon shine, tear drop in my eye.
  
  Country roads, take me home
  To the place I belong: West Virginia,
  Mountain momma, Take me home Country Roads.
  
  I hear a voice in the mornin' hour she calls me,
  The radio reminds me of my home far away,
  and drivin' down the road I get a feelin' that
  I should have been home yestarday, yestarday.
  
  Country roads, take me home
  To the place I belong: West Virginia,
  Mountain momma, Take me home Country Roads,
  Take me home, Country Roads,
  Take me home, Country Roads.
