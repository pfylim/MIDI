8. HAND IN HAND - DUNE

Chorus repeat
Let`s go hand in hand
Into lovely land.
Side by side to a world 
That shines so bright.
Let`s go hand in hand
Into lovely land.
Side by side.
Follow me into the light.
 

Let`s go hand in hand
Into lovely land.
Side by side.
Follow me into the light.
