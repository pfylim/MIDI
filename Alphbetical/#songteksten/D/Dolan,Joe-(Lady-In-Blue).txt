Title  : LADY IN BLUE

Who's that lady on her own
I wish that she would look my way
She sits there on her own
A painted smile upon her face
Lonely lady dressed in blue
May I have this dance with you
Let me hold you in my arms
Let the music fill you heart

Refrain:
Now that I'm with you
I wish this dance could last forever
Oh my lady blue
If you only knew
I was lonely, lonely, lady
Oh my lovely lady blue
I was lonely, lonely, lady
If you only knew

Will we ever meet again
Or is this just a one night stand
But as I hold you in my arms
I wish this night would never end
Oh my lady lady blue
Will you dance with me once more
And let me hold you like before
Let me hold you once again

Refrain: ...
