Splish splash, I was takin' a bath,
'long about a Saturday night.
A rub dub, just relaxin' in the tub
thinkin' in ev'rything was allright.
Well, I stepped out the tub, 
put my feet on the floor,
I wrapped the towel around me 
and I opened the door. 
And then a splish splash,
I jumped back in the bath,
well, how was I to know 
there was a party going on ?

Bing bang, I saw the whole gang
dancin' on my livin' room rug.
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop,
all the teens had the dancin' bug.
There was Lolipop with Peggy Sue.
Good golly, miss Molly was a event there too.
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath,
I went and put my dancin' shoes on.

I was a splishin' and a splashin',
I was a rollin' and a strollin',
I was a movin' and a groovin',
I was a reelin' with the feelin',
I was a splishin' and a splashin',
I was a rollin' and a strollin',
I was a movin' and a groovin',
I was a reelin' with the feelin'.
