
6. HOLD TIGHT! - DAVE DEE

Hold tight count to three
Got to stay close by me 
And hold tight sing and shout
Just wrap around about
And hold tight shut your eyes
Girl you should be for sight
Forget the other guys
You'll never fall this time you call 
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.

Hold tight make me feel
What you say is for real
And hold tight carousel
Girl you'll soon ring my bell 
And hold tight people fall 
Swinging through swinging high 
We're gonna make the sky
You'll never fall this time you call
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight. 

Hold tight count to three
Got to stay close by me 
And hold tight sing and shout
Just wrap around about
And hold tight shut your eyes
Girl you should be for sight
Forget the other guys
You'll never fall this time you call 
Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight.
