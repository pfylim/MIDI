When I touch you I can feel you shivering
I can feel your heart is beating fast
we are alone in this crowded
room oh tonight is something happening and it's something that 
should never be but there's a flame over you and me

And I can see the fire on the water
I can see the light shining in your eyes
I know that I can't stop it now
'cos I've been caught in the heat of the sun

There's a place in an ancient fortress
high above the worries of the world
I'd love you there for a long, long time,
and we'll discover all our deepest secrets
and let the spirit go flying free
until the dawn breaks over the sea

It's burning like fire on the water
I can see the light shining in your eyes
I know that I can't stop it now
'cos I've been caught in the heat of the sun
yes I've been caught in the heat of the sun
oh let it shine on me
And I can see the fire on the water
I can see the light shining in your eyes
I know that I can't stop it now
'cos I've been caught in the heat of the sun
yes I've been caught in the heat of the sun
oh let it shine on me
And I can see the fire on the water
Can't stop it now
And I can see the fire on the water
d, dreaming of the wide world
