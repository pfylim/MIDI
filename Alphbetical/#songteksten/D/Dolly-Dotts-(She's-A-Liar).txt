DOLLY DOTS - SHE'S A LIAR

She's a liar

She's a liar, she's a crier
She's a dumb little girl who pushes to get higher
She's a teaser, she's a squeezer
You gotta get away from her, 'cause she's a cheater

I don't want to be loved by you
She has made your brown eyes blue
Gotta leave her alone, 'cause she's a liar
Don't let her get down on you
Don't let her pull tricks on you
She's a girl who likes to play with fire

She's a dreamer and she's a screamer
She's not the kind of girl like people see her
She's a looser and she's a boozer
Likes to get it done her way, so she can use ya

So try to understand, she's no good for you
She'll be always looking for someone new
One day you're up, the next day you're down
'Cause she will keep your head spinning 'round and 'round

She's a liar - you know she's a liar
She's a crier - you know she's a crier
