Perhaps love - John Denver. (written by J. Denver) 
----------------------------------------------------------------


Perhaps love is like a mystic place, a shelter for the storm. 
It is there to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm. 
And in those times of trouble where you are most of all, 
the memory of love will bring you home. 
 
Perhaps love is like a window, perhaps an open door. 
It invites you to come closer, it wants to show you more. 
And even if you lose yourself and don't know what to do, 
the memory of love will see you through. 
 
Oh love, for some, is like a cloud, to some as strong as steel. 
For some a way of living, for some a way to feel. 
And some say love is holding on and some say letting go. 
And some say love is everything, and some say they don't know...

 
Perhaps love is like an ocean full of conflict, full of pain, 
like a fire when it's cold outside, thunder when it rains. 
If I should live forever and all my dreams come true, 
my memories of love will be of you.
