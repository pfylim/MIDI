On a dancining masque
On a dancining masque
On a dancining masque

Crossing the Champs Elysees
On a dancining masque
On a dancining masque
Calling a taxi
On a dancining masque
Say listen, can you show me the way
On a dancining masque

Here I got an invitation
For a bal masque tonight
Got to be there at eight
And I can't show up late
They told me today
I'm a dancer masque

Chorus:
Dance on, honey
I got to know tonight
Play that number
Before you go outside
Dance on, honey
I will be thinking and wondering
Who I am dancing with
Maybe you
Are the only one
Where I've been waiting for
So I-I-I just wonder and wait
Until then on the dancing masque

I'm in the mood for romance
On a dancining masque
And I don't know you
On a dancining masque
Maybe I better start dancing

And I promised myself
I will never fall in love again, baby
What a surprise
To realize
Now it's too late on a dancing masque
