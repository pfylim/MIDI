TAYLOR DAYNE - TELL IT TO MY HEART

I feel the night explode
When we're together
Emotion overload
In the heat of pleasure
Take me I'm yours into your arms
Never let me go
Tonight I really need to know

refrain:
Tell it to my heart
Tell me I'm the only one
Is this really lover or just a game
Tell it to my heart
I can feel my body rock
Every time you call my name

The passion so complete
It's never ending
As long as I receive
The message you're sending
Body to body
Soul to soul
Always feel you're near
So say the words I long to hear

refrain: ...

Love love on the run
Breaking us down
Though we keep holding on
I don't want to lose
No I can't let you go

refrain: ...

Tell it to my heart
Tell it from the start
Tell it to my heart
Tell it to my heart
Tell it from the start
Tell it to my heart
Never make it stop
Oh take it to the heart
Oh no no ah ah

refrain: ...
