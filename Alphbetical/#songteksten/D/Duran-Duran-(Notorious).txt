DURAN DURAN - NOTORIOUS

(Words & music: Taylor/Rhodes/Le Bon)

(No-no-notorious notorious)
(No-no-notorious)
I can't read about it
Burns the skin from your eyes
I'll do fine without it
Here's one you don't compromise
Lies come hard in disguise
They need to fight it out not wild about it
Lay your seedy judgments
Who says they're part of our lives

Refrain:
You own the money
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the profits to justify your reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it
That's why I've done it again

(No-no-notorious)
Girls will keep the secrets (uh)
So long the boys make a noise
Fools run rings to wake up
Something they'll never destroy
Grand notorious slam (bam)
And who really gives a damn for a flaky bandit
Don't ask me to bleed about it
I need this blood to survive

Refrain: ...

(Notorious, notorious)
You own the money
You control the witness
I'll leave you lonely
Don't monkey with my business
You pay the profits to justify your reasons
I heard your promise but I don't believe it

Refrain: ...

(No, no no)
That's why I've done it again
(No-notorious)
Yeah that's why I've done it again
(No-no-notorious)
Yeah that's why I've done it again
(No-notorious)
(No-notorious)
Yeah that's why I've done it again
(No-notorious)
(No-no-notorious)
