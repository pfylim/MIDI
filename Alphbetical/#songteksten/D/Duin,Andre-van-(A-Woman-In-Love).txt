Title  : A WOMAN IN LOVE

(Words & music: Frank Loesser)

Your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And oh, how they give you away
Why try to deny you're a woman in love
When I know very well what I say

I say no moon in the sky ever lent such a glow
Some flame deep within made them shine
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love
And may they gaze evermore into mine
Crazily gaze evermore into mine
