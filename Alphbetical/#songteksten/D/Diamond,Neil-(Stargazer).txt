Title  : STARGAZER

(Words & music: Neil Diamond)

Stargazer, you with your hand in the heavens
You'll never get by
Walkin' that high off the ground

Hey Moondreamer, I've been around and I've seen it
The higher you get
The harder they let you down
You pay your dues
It seems forever
And if you're clever
You may be in for a while
Then you're out of style

Hey Stargazer, probably think I'm crazy
And you haven't heard
One single word I've said

Now I don't want to burst your double
But you got trouble
Don't you know
The higher the top the longer the drop
Hey Stargazer
