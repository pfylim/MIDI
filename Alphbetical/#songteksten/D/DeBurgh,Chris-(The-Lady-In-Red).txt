CHRIS DE BURGH - THE LADY IN RED


I've never seen you looking so lovely
As you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
Mm mm mm mm
I've never seen so many men ask you if
You wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

Refrain:
The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek there's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous
As you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to
Be there by your side
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I did tonight

Refrain: ...

The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek there's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I wanna be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way, way you look tonight
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red
My lady in red
