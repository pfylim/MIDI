Waiting at the water's edge
watching all the ships as they are heading for the harbour wall
I was just a boy, I was just a boy
dreaming of the wide world, dreaming of the wide world

Watching as they disappear
reading out the names of all the places I have never been
looking out to sea, staring to sea
dreaming of a wide world, dreaming of the wide world

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away
sailing away, with you tonight, with you tonight

Walking down another street
underneath the red lights, I am watching where the shadows fall
looking at the girls, listening to the girls
dreaming of a new world, dreaming of that new world

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away
sailing away, in your arms  tonight, 
in your arms tonight

I wish I was sailing away, sailing away,
sailing away, with you now, with you now
