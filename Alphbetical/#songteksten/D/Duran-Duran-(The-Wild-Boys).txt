DURAN DURAN - THE WILD BOYS

The wild boys are calling on their way back from the fire
In August moon's surrender to a dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered on the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside in a
sore afraid new world
They tried to break us, looks like they'll try again

Refrain:
Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome there's bloodstain
for your pain
And your telephone's been ringing while you're
dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels now figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over secrets they could tell
They tried to tame you looks like they'll try again

Refrain: ...
