Ship to shore, do you read me anymore
this line is bad , and fading
ship to shore, answer my call
send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home

I have been to see the world,
tasted life at every turn
and all the time
your face came back to haunt me

Day by day the feeling grew
I know I'm still in love with you
the further that I go
the more I know it, I wanna show it

Ship to shore, do you read me anymore
this line is bad , and fading
ship to shore, answer my call
send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home

Moving fast, all systems go
you and I had time to groe
before there was a breakdown in transmission

How I wish that we could turn
the clock back to the days when
we were lovers in the true sense
of the meaning, you must believe me

Ship to shore, do you read me anymore
this line is bad , and fading
ship to shore, answer my call
send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home

Ship to shore, ship tp shore, ship to shore.....

I cannot believe my eyes,
but I think I see a light
you are everything I've always
wanted in my life
