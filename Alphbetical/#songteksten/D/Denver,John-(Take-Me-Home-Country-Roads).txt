Titel:     Take me home country roads

Interpret: John Denver

Almost heaven - West virgina
Blue Ridge mountain - Shennandoah river
Life is old there - older then the trees
Younger than the mountains - growin' like a breeze

Country Roads, take me home 
To the place, I belong
West virginia, Mountain mama
Take me home, Country Roads

All my mem'ries - get around there
Miner's ladys - stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty - painted in the sky
Misty tates of moonshine - teardrops in my eyes

Refrain

I hear her voice in the moorning hours she called me
The radio remind's me of my home far away
Drivin' down the road I get a feeling that I should have been
home yesterday, yesterday

Refrain
