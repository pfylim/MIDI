I'm standing in the station
I am waiting for a train
to take me to the border
and my loved one far away
I watched a bunch of soldiers heading for the war
I could hardly even bear to see them go

Rolling through the countryside
tears are in my eyes
we're coming to the borderline
I'm ready with my lies
and in the early morning rain, I see her there
and I know I'll have to say goodbye again

And it's breaking my heart, I know what I must do
I hear my country call me, but I want to be with you
I'm taking my side, one of use will lose
don't let go, I want to know
that you will wait for meuntil the day
there's no borderline, no borderline

Walking past the border guards
reaching for her hand
showing no emotion
I want to break into a run
but these are only boys, and I will never know
how men can see the wisdom in war

And it's breaking my heart, I know what I must do
I hear my country call me, but I want to be with you
I'm taking my side, one of use will lose
don't let go, I want to know
that you will wait for meuntil the day
there's no borderline, no borderline,
no borderline, no borderline....
