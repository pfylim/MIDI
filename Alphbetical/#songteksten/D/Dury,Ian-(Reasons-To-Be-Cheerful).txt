Title  : REASONS TO BE CHEERFUL PART 3

(Words & music: Ian Dury)

Why don't you get back into bed, why don't you get back into bed?
Some of Buddy Holly, the working folly, good golly Miss Molly and boats
Hammersmith Palace, the Bolshoi Ballet, jump back in the alley, add nanny
goats
Eighteen-wheeler, csammels, dominecker camels, all other mammals plus equal
votes
Seeing Piccadilly, Fanny Smith and Willy being rather silly, and porridge
oats
A bit of grin and bear it, a bit of come and share it, you're welcome
We can spare it
Yellow sock
Too short to the haughty, to mutty to be naughty, going on forty, no electric
shocks
The juice of the carrot, the smile of the parrot
a little drop of claret, anything that rocks
Elvis and Scotty, the days wehn I ain't spotty
Sitting on the potty, curing smallpox

Chorus:
Reasons to be cheerful, part three (3x)
Reasons to be cheerful, one, two, three

Health service glasses, gigolos and brasses round of skinny bottoms
Taking mum to Paris, lighting up the chalice wee Willy Harris
Bantu Stephen Biko, listening to Rico, Harpo, Groucho, Chico
Cheddar cheese and pickle, the Vincent motor-scikle, slap and tickle
Woody Allen, Dail, Dimitri and Pasquale, balabala and volare
Something nice to study, phoning up a buddy
Being in my nuddy
Saying okey dokey, a singalonga smokey, coming out of chokey
John Coltrane's soprano, Adri Celentano,Bonar Colleano

Chorus: ...

Reasons to be cheerful, part three (3x)
But what about (5x)
Yes, yes dear, dear perhaps next year or maybe even better
In which case
