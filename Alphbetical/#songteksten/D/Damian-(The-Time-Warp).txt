DAMIAN - THE TIME WARP

(Words & music: R. O'Brien)

Time, Time, T-T-T-Time Warp
Are you ready (yeah)
So you think you can do the Time Warp, eh?
(Yeah)
Well let me tell you (ooh)

It's astounding, time is fleeting madness
Takes its toll
But listen closely, not for very much longer
I've got to keep control

Chorus:
It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic trust 
That really drives you insane
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

It's so dreamy, oh fantasy free me
So you can't see me, no not at all
It's another dimension with 
Voyeuristic intention
Well secluded, I'll see all

Chorus: ...

Rap:
Put your right hand up above your head
And your left hand too like my sister said
Put both hands slowly to your hips
Now move your body and lick your lips
Lick your lips
Now jump to the left
And step to the right
You got the Time Warp
Now get it right (get it right)
Get it right, get it right

Chorus: ...

Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again
