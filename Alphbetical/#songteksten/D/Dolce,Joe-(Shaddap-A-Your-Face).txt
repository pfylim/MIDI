Title  : SHADDAP-A YOUR FACE
Artist : JOE DOLCE

(Words & music: Joe Dolce)

Allo, I'm-a Guiseppe
I got-a something special-a for you, ready?
Uno, due, tre, quatro

When I was a boy
Just about the eight-a grade
Mama used to say
Don't stay out-a late
With the bad-a boys
Always shoot-a pool
Guiseppe, going to flunk-a school
And-a mama used to say all-a time

Chorus:
What's-a matter you? Hey
Got-a no respect
What-a you t'ink you do
Why you look-a so sad
It's-a not so bad
It's-a nice-a place
Ah, shaddap-a your face

That's-a my mama, I can remember

Big accordion solo
Play dat again
Really nice, really nice
Mama, she said it all-a da time

Chorus: ...

That's-a my mama

Boy it make-a me sick
All the t'ing I gotta do
I can't-a get-a no kicks
Always got to follow rules
Boy, it make-a me sick
Got to feel-a like a fool
And-a mama used to say all-a time

Chorus: ...

Soon-a come a day
Gonna be a big-a star
Den I make-a tv shows and a-movies
Get-a myself a new car
But still I be myself
I don't want-a to change a t'ing
Still a-dance and a-sing
I t'ink about-a mama, she used to say

Chorus: ...

Hello, everybody
'at's out-a dere in-a radio and-a tv land
Did you kow I had a big-a hit-a song in-a
Italy with-a dis
Shaddap-a your face
I sing-a dis song, all my fans applaud
Day clap-a da hands
Dat-a make me feel-a so good

Chorus: ...
