Singer : CORY DAYE
Title  : WIGGLE AND GIGGLE ALL NIGHT

(Words & music: Sandy Linzer/L. Russel Brown)

I was walkin' down the street when I saw this
Handsome soldier boy winkin', winkin', winkin' at me
He said: I'd like to make a date
I said: So sorry, but it's late
He said: What's the matter baby, ain't ya free?
Ain't ya free, free to be the love of my life

Chorus:
He said: I love the way you wiggle and I love the
way you giggle
And I'd love to give you just a little kiss on your lips
He was such a delight, so we wiggled and we giggled all night, hmm
We wiggled and we giggled all night
This boy now got me wrapped 'round his finger
Destroyed now, under his thumb
He treats me unkind, leaves me drinkin' till I'm blind
This boy now I know he never will come

I met this crazy guy from Texas, said his father
Was a Mexican, his mother was the purest Cherokee
It was the litle part of her in him
That made him such an Indian
But he was all American to me
To me he promised freedom for the rest of my life

Chorus: ...

So the answer to this riddle when you're caught
Up in the middle of the devil and the deep blue sea
Love 'em when you get 'em
And you hope you don't regret 'em
When you let 'em in your heart eternally, eternally
I'll be looking for the love of my life
'Cause I'll always have a giggle and you know I'll love to wiggle
And I'll always love to have a little kiss on my lips
'Cause it's such a delight when I wiggle and giggle all night
Wiggle and giggle all night
This boy now got me wrapped 'round his finger
Destroyed now, under his thumb
He treats me unkind, leaves me drinkin' till I'm blind
This boy now I know he's never gonna come
