9. STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - FAR CORPORATION

Intro

1. Strophe:
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
with a word she can get what she came for.

Refrain:
U-hu-hu hu-huh-hu
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

2. Strophe:
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure,
'cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings,
sometimes all our thoughts are misgiven.

Instrumental

Make me wonder
uh - uh, and makes me wonder.

3. Strophe:
There's a feeling I get  when I look to the west
and my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen  rings of smoke through the trees
and the voices of those who stand looking.

Refrain:
U-hu-hu  hu-huhu-hu
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.

4. Strophe:
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn  for those who stand long
and the forests will echo with laughter.

Instrumental

Uh - it makes me wonder
uh - it makes me wonder
uh - it makes me wonder 
uh - it makes me wonder
It makes me wonder!
