Title  : It Ain't What You Do
Singer : Fun Boy 3 & Bananarama


It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it (3x)
That's what gets results
It ain't what you do, it's the time that you do it (3x)
That's what gets results

You can try hard, don't mean a thing
Take it easy, then your jive will swing
It ain't what you do, it's the place that you do it (3x)
That's what gets results

My father was smart, but I soon found out
I didn't know what love was all about
But then I learned, i must confess
That love is like a game of chess

It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it
It ain't what you do, it's the time that you do it
It ain't what you do, it's the place that you do it
That's what gets results

You can try hard, don't mean a thing
Take it easy, then your jive will swing
It ain't what you do, etc (Repeat 1e Couplet)
