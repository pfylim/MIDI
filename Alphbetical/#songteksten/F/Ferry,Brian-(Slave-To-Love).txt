BRYAN FERRY - SLAVE TO LOVE

Tell her I'll be waiting
In the usual place
With the tired and weary
And there's no escape

To need a woman
You've got to know
How the strong get weak
And the rich get poor

Slave to love
Oh I'm a slave to love

You're running with me
But don't touch the ground
We're the restless hearted
Not the chained and bound

The sky is burning
A sea of flame
Though your world is changing
I will be the same

Slave to love
Oh I'm a slave to love
Slave to love (na na na na na na na na)
Slave to love (I can't escape)
I'm a slave to love

Can you help me?
Can you help me?

The storm is breaking
So it seems
We're too young to reason
Too grown up to dream

Now spring is turning
Your face to mine
I can hear your laughter
I can see your smile

Slave to love (na na na na) oh (na na na na)
Slave to love (I can't escape)
I'm a slave to love
