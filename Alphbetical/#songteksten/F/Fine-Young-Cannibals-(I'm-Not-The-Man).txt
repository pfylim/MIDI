Title  : I'm Not The Man
Singer : Fine Young Cannibals


When I'm in trouble
Or out of step
If my balance has been upset
Oh there's a feeling
I can't accept
There's one thing
Helps me to forget

Wonder what I'm thinking
Wonder why I'm drinking

But it's plain to see
I'm not the man
I used to be

If live were easy and didn't ask
Didn't tease me
Or take things back
I could start to understand
What makes me the man I am

Oh it's plain and it's a shame
I'm not the man I used to be

I've lost dreams
That won't come back
Memories fading fast
I should save
The ones I have
What's the use
Most of them are bad

It's plain and it's a shame
I can't explain
But I'm not the man
I used to be
It's a shame
Don't know my name
I can't explain
I'm not the man
I used to be do you know my name

Do you need me
But I'm not the man
