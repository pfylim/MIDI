FRIDA - SHINE

You give me love
You give me love
You give me love
You give me love
You give me love

In the morning see you shine
Feel your body moving mine
The twilight slowly turning
I watch you walking away

You give me love, you make me shine
Clear in the midnight sky
My fantasy makes me shine
Clear in the midnight sky

Don't let the sun go down
Don't be fooled by the changes you see
Interpretations vary once in a while
Don't close the door on me

In the darkness see you shine
Move your body close to mine
I'm feeling excitation
I feel a perfect vision
My fantasy tonight

You give me love, you make me shine
Clear in the midnight sky
My fantasy makes me shine

Cool as ice, I broke away, did I
Catch your love in time
More communication
More communication, that's all I need
And like a star I'll shine

Moving away

You give me love, you make me shine
Clear in the midnight sky
My fantasy makes me shine
Clear in the midnight sky

In the darkness see you shine
Move your body close to mine
I'm feeling excitation
I feel a perfect vision
In the darkness see you shine
Move your body close to mine
I'm feeling excitation
I feel a perfect vision
I'm feeling excitation
I feel a perfect vision
My fantasy tonight

You give me love, you make me shine
