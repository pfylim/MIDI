Schoolgirl, woncha talk to me?
Show a little hospitality
I'm a lonesome stranger in your college town
Schoolgirl, woncha walk me around?

Schoolgirl with your foxy looks
Hey baby, let me tote your books
Woncha try a little love, babe, you can't go wrong

Chorus:
An' it's a hey, hey, hey
See the sun, it's sinkin' down
You know it's goin' away
An' it's a hey, hey, hey
Girl the nighttime is the right time
Say okay!

Schoolgirl, let me help you please
Help you study 'bout the birds and bees
You can write a little paper on the rites of sping
Schoolgirl, sha la la la ling

Chorus: ...

Schoolgirl, tell me what you say
Hay baby, doncha turn away
Stop and think about it darlin' don't you want romance
Schoolgirl, gimme half a chance

Chorus: ...
