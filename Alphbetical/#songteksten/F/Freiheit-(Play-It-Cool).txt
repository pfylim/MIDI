FREIHEIT - PLAY IT COOL

There's something wrong
Something has gone
And your eyes are cold and lonely
Tears for no one 
Sitting next to you
I feel the way you do
so is it any wonder
We realize the moon is turning blue

Sweet dreams in vain
But who's to blame
I remember love was easy
And forever
That was long ago
Oh, how was I to know
You took all my affection
And gave it to a dozen Romeos

Refrain:
Oh oh you
Though I see you can't hide your tears
I don't want to live with all those fears
Guess I always have to be your fool
Better break it up and play it cool

If you intend to let it end
You don't need no explanations
No excuses
So look me in the eye
'Cause you don't have to lie
I wanna hear you tell me that starting out
Again's not worth a try

Refrain: ...
