FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS - SHE DRIVES ME CRAZY

I can't stop the way I feel
Things you see the don't seem real
Tell me what you've got in mind
'Cause we're running out of time
Won't you ever set me free
This waiting round's killing me

Refrain:
She drives me crazy ooh ooh
Like no one else ooh ooh
She drives me crazy ooh ooh
I can't help myself ooh ooh

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me that's no surprise
What I had for you was true
Things go wrong they always do

Refrain: ...

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone
