Title  : RHIANNON

Rhiannon rings like a bell thru the night
And wouldn't you lover to love her
She rules her life like a bird in flight
And who will be her lover
And who will be her lover

All your life you've never seen
A woman, taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win

She is like a cat in the dark
And then she is the darkness
She rules her life a fine skylark
And when the sky is starless

All your life you've never seen
A woman, taken by the wind
Would you stay if she promised you heaven
Will you ever win

Dreams unwind
Love's state of mind
