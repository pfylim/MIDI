FARLEY 'JACKMASTER' FUNK - LOVE CAN'T TURN AROUND

(Words & music: J.M. Funk/V. Lawrence)

(Love can't turn around)
(Love can't turn around)

Now this is how it started
My dreams are broken hearted
Girl I want you baby
We'll never be the same
'Cause you play those silly games
And yet I want you girl

They say we were an item
My thoughts I try and hide 'em
yet I need you
But when we get down to it
I just love the way you do it
And I love you

Refrain:
Love can't turn around (Love can't turn around)
Love can't turn around (Love can't turn around)
Love can't turn around (Love can't turn around)
Love can't turn around (Love can't turn around)

I thought you were my lover
But you left me for another
But I need you
I read it in your letter
Don't you make me feel any better
'Cause it's not true
Now in my secret visions
Forget about decisions
'Cause got to have you near me
Girl I wonder do you hear me
'Cause I need you

Refrain: ...

(Love can't turn around)
