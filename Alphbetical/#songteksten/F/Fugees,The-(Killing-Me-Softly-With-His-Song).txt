KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH HIS SONG - FUGEES

 
Chorus
Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
Singing my life with his words,
Killing me softly with his song, 
Killing me softly with his song,
Telling my whole life with his words, 
Killing me softly with his song.

I heard he sang a good song, 
I heard he had his style,
And so I came to see him 
And listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy, 
Stranger to my eyes,

Chorus

I felt all flushed with fever,
Embarrassed by the crowd, 
I felt he found my letters 
And read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish, 
But he just kept right on 

Chorus

Ooooo
Woooo oooooo
La la la la la la
Wooo Laaa
Wooo Laaaaaa
Laaaaa Aaaaaa

Chorus repeat and fade out
