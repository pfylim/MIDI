  13. THE POWER OF LOVE - Franky Goes To Hollywood
  
  I'll protect you from the hooded claw
  Keep the vampires from your door.
  
  Ayayayay, feels like fire
  I'm so in love with you
  Dreams are like angels
  They keep bad at bay (bad at bay)
  Love is the light scaring darkness away
  I'm so in love with you
  Purge the soul
  Make love your goal.
  
  The power of love
  A force from above
  Cleaning my soul
  Flame on burn desire
  Love with tongues of fire
  Purge the soul
  Make love your goal.
  
  I'll protect you from the hooded claw
  Keep the vampires from your door
  When the chips are down
  I'll be around with my undying 
  Death defying love for you
  Envy will hurt itself
  Let yourself be beautiful
  Sparkle in love and flowers and pearls
  And pretty girls
  Love is like an energy
  Rushing in rushing inside of me
  Hey.
  
  The power of love
  A force from above
  Cleaning my soul
  Flame on burn desire
  Love with tongues of fire
  Purge the soul
  Make love your goal.
  
  This time we go so blind
  Lovers entwine divine divine
  Love is danger
  Love is pleasure
  Love is pure, the only treasure
  I'm so in love with you
  Purge the soul
  Make love your goal.
   
  The power of love
  A force from above
  Cleaning my soul
  The power of love
  A force from above
  A sky scraping goal
  Flame on burn desire
  Love with tongues of fire
  Purge the soul
  Make love your goal.
  
  I'll protect you from the hooded claw
  Keep the vampires from your door.
