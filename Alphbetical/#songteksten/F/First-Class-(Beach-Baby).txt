La la la la la la la 
La la la la la la la 
Do you remember back in old LA?
Oh oh oh
When everybody drove a Chevrolet
Oh oh oh
Whatever happened to the boy next door?
The suntan crook
An all American male.

Remember dancing at the High School club?
Oh oh oh
The dress I ruined with the soda pop
Oh oh oh
I didn't recognise the girl next door        
The beat up sneakers and the pony tail.

Beach baby, beach baby
Give me your hand
Give me something 
That I can remember
Just like before
We could walk by the shore
In the moonlight.

Beach baby, beach baby
There on the sand
From July to the end of September
The surfing was fun
We'd be out in the sun everyday.

Mmm, I never thought that it would end
(Wooh wooh)
Mmm, and I was everybody's friend
(Wooh wooh)
Long hot days (doo...) blue sea haze (doo...)
Juke box plays
But now it's fading away.

Ah, dododododododo
(Dododo dododo dododo).

Ah...

We couldn't wait for Graduation Day
Oh oh oh
We took the car and drove to San Jose
Oh oh oh
That's where you told me that
You'd wear my ring
I guess you don't remember anything .

Beach baby, beach baby
Give me your hand (give me, give me your hand)
Give me something 
That I can remember (give me something to remember)
Just like before
We could walk by the shore
In the moonlight.

Beach baby, beach baby
There on the sand (there on, there on the sand)
From July to the end of September (from July to September)
The surfing was fun
We'd be out in the sun everyday.

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum doo doo doo...

Dododo dododo dododo.

Ahahah...         

Beach baby, beach baby... dodododododo.    (Ahahah...)
