DOH WAH DIDDY - FUN FACTORY


Chorus:
There she was. 
Just a walking down the street.
Singing Doh Wah Diddy 
Diddy Dam Diddy Doh.
Snapping her fingers, 
And shuffling to the beat.
Singing Doh Wah Diddy 
Diddy Dam Diddy Doh

Doin‹ the Do. Doin‹ the Do. 
Doin‹ the Do. Doin‹ the Do.     
Doin‹ the Do. Doin‹ the Do.     
Doin‹ the Do. Doin‹ the Do.     

Doh Wah Di Diddy 
Di Dam Diddy Doh.
Check out the groove,
And the beat is gonna move you.
Shake it, shake it,
Shake it, shake it,  
Until you get crazy,
But just don‹t fake it.
So you want me to shake it.
So I take it, I grab the mic.
And I sure won‹t fake it.
Me and my boy smooth T.
We get down with the beat.
It‹s the Doh Wah Diddy sound.
Let this beat just spin you around.
Get up and stand up and move
To this sound.
Let this rhythm control your feet.
It‹s the factory of fun you need.
Unique styles is 
What we‹re bringing you.
‹Cause we can blow up
Y‹alli came to do.
A brand new style for the dancefloor,
‹Cause I got more you want more.

Chorus (2x)

She looks good, she looks good
She looks good, she looks fine.
She looks good, she looks good
She looks good, she looks fine.

Get your booties on the floor.
Get them down, what you‹re waiting for.
Wave your hands from here to there.
To the rhythm up.
Yes in the air.
All the ladies scream.
All the fellows ho.
‹Cause I got the flow,
And I‹m about to go,
So I pass to smooth T.
‹Cause he‹s got the flow.
Pump it up, pump it up the speaker.
Let the bass hit you,
Straight and deeper.
Can you stand, can you stand the power
After this all you need is
A shower, so pass me the soap.
And let me wash stuff up G.
The Doh Wah Diddy dance is made 
For you and me.
So party people just get on up.
‹Cause our second has come,
With a brandnew cut.

Chorus (3x)

She looks good, she looks good
She looks good, she looks fine.
She looks good, she looks good
She looks good, she looks fine.
She looks good, she looks fine.
She looks good, she looks fine. 
And she nearly blew my mind.
