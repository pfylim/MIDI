12. WILD DAYS - FOOL`S GARDEN

Do you love me too? I love you.

Skies blue, the water`s blue too.
My baby `s walkin` away.
Out of the blue into a starting day.
She feels good and she feels sorry for me. 
She tells me, honey don`t worry
But I am so confused. My baby`s walkin`
Walkin` away.
It don`t mean nothing to me.
It don`t mean nothing to me.

Chorus
Stay. Think about the wild, wild days.
Don`t you feel like I feel
About the wild, wild days.
Is it a dream, is it real?
About the wild, wild days.

Sitting in the middle of the battlefield.
My baby `s walkin` away.
All the wounds that could have been healed
My baby `s walkin` away.
I brought you flowers.
I buttered your bread.
I rushed I followed you
Remember you said
That you would love me
Till the end and now no
Walkin` away.
It don`t mean nothing to me.
It don`t mean nothing to me.

Chorus

Too late. It`s time for you to wake up.
She don`t need flowers
Only diamonds and make up.
So sorry but now she`s all my mine mine.

Talk about the wild, wild days.
Don`t you feel like I feel
About the wild, wild days.
Is it a dream, is it real?
About the wild, wild days.

Talk about the wild, wild days.
Don`t you feel like I feel
About the wild, wild days.
Is it a dream, is it real?
About the wild, wild days.
Don`t steal yourself away. Oh no.
