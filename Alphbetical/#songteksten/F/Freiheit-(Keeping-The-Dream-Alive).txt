FREIHEIT - KEEPING THE DREAM ALIVE

Tonight the rain is falling
Full of memories
Of people and places
And while the past is calling
In my fantasy
I remember their faces
The hopes we had were much too high
Way out of reach but we have to try

Refrain:
The game will never be over
Because we're keeping the dream alive

I hear myself recalling
Things you said to me
The night it all started
And still the rain is falling
Makes me feel the way
I felt when we parted

The hopes we had were much too high
Way out of reach but we have to try
No need to hide no need to run
'Cause all the answers come one by one

Refrain: ...

I need you, I love you

Refrain: ...

The hopes we had were much too high
Way out of reach but we have to try
No need to hide no need to run
'Cause all the answers come one by one

Refrain: ...2x...

The game will never be over
