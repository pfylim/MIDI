Title  : Suspicious Minds
Singer : Fine Young Cannibals


We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much baby
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe
A world I'm saying?

Chorus:
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds
We can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

I saw and old friend I know
I stopped to say hello
But I could still see
Suspicion in your eyes
Here we go again
Ask me where I've been
You can't see the tears are real 
I'm crying

Chorus

Let our love survive
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Don't let a good thing die
Don't you know
I never lied to you
