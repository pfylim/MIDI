Title  : SHOW ME THE WAY

(Words & music: Peter Frampton)

I wonder how you're feeling
There's ringing in my ears
And no one to relate to
'Cept the sea

Who can I believe in
I'm kneeling on the floor
There has to be a force
Who do I phone

The stars are out and shining
But all I really want to know

Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you show me the way, yeah

Well I can see no reason
You're living on your nerves
When someone drops a cup and I submerge
I'm swimming in a circle
I feel I'm going down
There has to be a fool to play my part
Someone thought of healing 
but all I really want to know

Oh, won't you show me the way
I want you show me the way, yeah
I want you day after day, yeah

(guitar solo)

I wonder if I'm dreaming
I feel so unashamed
I can't believe this is happening to me
I watch you when you're sleeping
Then I want to take your love

Oh, won't you show me the way, every day
Oh, won't you show me the way, one more time
I want you day after day - hey - hey
