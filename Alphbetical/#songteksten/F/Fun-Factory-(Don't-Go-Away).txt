1. DON`T GO AWAY- FUN FACTORY

Chorus
Don`t go away.
Please stay by my side.
Just hold me tight.
I wanna be with you tonight.
Don`t go away
And show me your love.
You bring me joy.
You are the center of my life

Oh oh oooooo
Oh oh oooooo
Oh oh oooooo
Oh oh oooooo

Oh darling you, you`re driving me crazy.
And I don`t know what to do.
I lose control.
I want to be your full-time lover.
And no matter where you are.
I`ll be with you.

Don`t go away, don`t go away
Why won`t you stay just another day.
Give yourself some time.
And a lot of silly shime.
Don`t miss us start reaching
Everybody feeling fine.
One time, one time is it now.
We don`t care.
We enter all the summer.
And the love that we share.
We want you, yes, you, yes.
For our time.

Chorus

Oh oh oooooo (repeat)

You know that you`re my only lover.
And hope that I am your
Your only one too.
You said that there
There is no other. Ooh.
And now I`m sitting here
Like a fool.

Hey, just take it slow.
Just take it slow.
Nowhere to run.
Nowhere to go.
We join the party.
Meet the rest of the crew.
`Cause what we do we do it for you.
Don`t stay around
Come on just kick it.
`Cause when we get in House
You know we get a wicket.
That`s how the party goes.
We love you so.

Chorus

Oh oh oooooo (repeat)
