Title  : WHAT'S THE MATTER BABY?

(Words & music: Ellen Foley)

I know the reason you've been crying
And I hope she wont be needing you
How does it feel being all left behind

Chorus:
What's the matter baby
What's the matter baby
Did she hear the news

And I hear you found out she has been cheating
Oh yeah and I heard she was untrue
Well how does it feel being on the outside
Outside, outside looking, looking in
What's the matter baby if she heard the news

Chorus: ...

Remember, remember when I needed you so bad
Remember, what she had to say

You don't really doubt to find another room
You laughed
You laughed and then you walked away

I know
Know that you've been asking about me
What's the matter baby
Well I'm sorry but I got somebody new
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I heard, I heard, I heard
It's about over
I really wanna tell you something baby
I've got something for you

What's the matter baby, if she heard the news
What's the matter baby, baby, baby
If she heard the news
What's the matter baby
What's the matter honey
Come on boy, you can tell her
A friend of yours Yes
And I know a little bit about life
Did it hurt oh baby did it hurt
Did it hurt now
What's the matter baby
Yes
