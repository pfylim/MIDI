RENE FROGER - WINTER IN AMERICA

The harbor's misty in the morning love
Oh how I miss December
The Frangipanni opens up to kiss the salty air
I know you're getting ready for the office
I suppose he's still there with you
Sharing our morning sun

Winter in America is cold
And I just keep growing older
I wish I could have known
Enough of love
To leave love enough alone

I've learned something of love
I wish I'd known before you left me
But it's funny how you don't know 
what you've got, until it's gone
And I hope you're getting all the love 
you've ever wanted
Still I wish I was there with you
Sharing our morning sun

I waken to the sadness of the rain
And making love to strangers
And wishing I had known
Enough of love to leave love enough alone

Winter in America is cold
And I just keep growing older
I wish I could have known
Enough of love
To leave love enough alone

Winter in America is cold
And I just keep growing older
I wish I could have kno-ooh-ooh-own
Enough of love
To leave love enough alone
