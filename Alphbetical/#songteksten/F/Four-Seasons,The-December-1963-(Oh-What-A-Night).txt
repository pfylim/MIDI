Singer : FOUR SEASONS 
Title  : DECEMBER 1963 (OH, WHAT A NIGHT)

Oh, what a night
Late December back in sixtythree
What a very special time for me
I remember what a night

Oh, what a night
You know I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room
Oh, my
As I recall it ended much too soon
Oh, what a night

Hypnotizing mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

Oh I felt a rush like a rolling ball of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh what a night

Why'd it take so long to see the light
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right
What a lady what a night
