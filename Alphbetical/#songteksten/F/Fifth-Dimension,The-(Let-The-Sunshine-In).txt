1.  We starve, look, at one another short of breath  walk-

  ing proudly in our winter coats, wearing smells from lab'ratories

  facing a dying nation

  Of moving paper fantasy, listening for the new told lies

  with supreme visions of lonely tunes



2.  Some-where, inside something there is a rush, of

  greatness who knows what stands in front of

  our lives I fashion my future, on films in space

  Silence tells me secretly everything, everything, everything


  LET THE SUNSHINE, LET THE SUNSHINE IN ,THE SUN SHINE IN (2 X)


  Singing, my space songs on a spiderweb ,sitar

  Life is around you and in you

  Answer for Timothy Leary, deary

  Silence tells me secretly everything, everything, everything


  LET THE SUNSHINE, LET THE SUNSHINE IN ,THE SUN SHINE IN (2 X)
