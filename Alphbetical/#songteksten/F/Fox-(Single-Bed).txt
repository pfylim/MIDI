Title  : SINGLE BED

C c come come inside
Oh, I've been expecting you here tonight
Sh sh sh shoes shake 'em off
While I go and turn the music down soft

Oh, but all I got is a single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
Now ain't that a shame
You missed the last train
'Cause all I got is a single bed

S s s single bed
S s s single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
S s s single bed
S s s single bed
I've got a one solitary love soul single bed

P p p pour out the wine
And we could explore each others mind
T t t time don't it fly
When the pleasures of night are reaching so high

Oh, and all I got is a single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
Now ain't that a shame
You missed the last train
'Cause all I got is a single bed

S s s single bed
S s s single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
S s s single bed
S s s single bed
I've got a one solitary love soul single bed

(solo)

S s s single bed
S s s single bed
There ain't no room for your sweet head
S s s single bed
S s s single bed
I've got a one solitary love soul single bed
