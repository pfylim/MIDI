FRANKIE GOES TO HOLLYWOOD - RAGE HARD

(Rage)
(Rage rage rage)
Rage hard

Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong
On the wings of tomorrow
Rise up in millions get off your knees
Dispelling the demons ooh
In the valley of danger
We all walk together sculptures in sorrow
With love light to follow on
Sweet head of Apollo

Refrain:
(Rage hard) into the light
(Rage hard) doing it right doing it right
(Rage hard) against the dark
(Rage hard) make your mark

Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing

(Rage hard) into the light
(Rage hard) doing it right
(Rage hard) against the dark
(Rage hard rage)

The blue eyes of the children
They shine without fear
Hope is the future with oceans of cheer
(Nothing to fear)
There's nothing to fear
The laughter of angels
Resounding from heaven
Keep fighting the favors
Of charlatan saviours

Refrain: ...

Let the tournament begin
(Don't give up and don't give in)
(Rage hard) into the light
(Rage hard) doing it right
(Rage hard) against the dark
(Rage hard) make your mark

I don't know which way to go
My love's like driven snow
When we pass the test of time
My love you shall be mine
And if only lost and lonely
Is all that's wrong with me
We'll be free be free be free

Laugh like the head of Apollo
Young and strong
On the wings of tomorrow
(Rage hard rage hard)
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in ow
(Rage hard) into the night
(Rage hard) doing it right
Let the tournament begin
Don't give up and don't give in
Strength to rise up strength to win
Strength to save the world from losing
