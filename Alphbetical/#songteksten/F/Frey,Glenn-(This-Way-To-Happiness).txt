
12. This Way To Happiness - GLENN FREY

We hit a town on some midnight-highway
I don't know where I was drivin' by myself
Night was cold, the wind was blowing,
Me I felt like someone else
I was achin', I was alone
No destination, so far away from home
Suddenly I found myself callin' to the Heavens above
Please send me someone to love

Which way to happiness, over the mountains
Which way to freedom, just across the sea
What I've been searchin' for
Seems like forever now
Which way to happiness for someone like me.

Seems like I spent my own life running
Running away from what I can be
Down to some endless world just south of Nowhere
Always movin', but never really free
I had a dream, I said a prayer
Just like the answer, you're standin' there
Like a neon sign that was fifteen storeys tall
I can hear the angels call.

This way to happiness, train is leaving
Over the mountains, down in the sea
Highway to freedom
Is when you start believin'
This way to Happiness, you and me

I've hold this grief from coast to coast 
I've seen a lot, I've done more than most
I was like a sailor lost in sea
Like an angel from above, you came down and rescued me

This way to happiness, train is leaving
Over the mountains, down in the sea
The highway of freedom
Is when you start believin'
This way to Happiness, you and me.
This way to Happiness, you and me.
