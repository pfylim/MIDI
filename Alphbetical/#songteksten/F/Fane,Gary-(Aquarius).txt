Title  : AQUARIUS
Artist : GARY FANE

(Words & music: G. Veen)

Sea gave birth to life
In many ways we know
The sea goes with the stars
The stars tell how we go
And time tells through the ages
The signs are always clear
And man accepts and follows him

Chorus:
Aquarius, Aquarius
The time is so near
For people to share
There's laughter and love all around
Aquarius, Aquarius

Equality is right, brotherhood brings light
Freedom for mankind
And we won't have to fight
The stars tell through the ages
The signs are always clear
Man must accept the need to live

Chorus: ...

Now is the time to follow him
Now is the time to follow him
Don't wonder when we go down, go down
Aquarius, Aquarius
