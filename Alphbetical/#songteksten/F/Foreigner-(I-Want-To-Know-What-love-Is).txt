6. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT LOVE IS - FOREIGNER

Intro: Synth-Pad und getragener Rhythmus

Vers 1:
I've gotta take a little time,
a little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older

Bridge: .... .... oh .. lo-ove!

Vers 2:
Now this mountain I must climb,
Feels like the world upon my shoulders.
Through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows older.

Zwischenvers:
In my life   there's been heartache and pain
I don't know  if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life.

Refrain:
I want to know what love is,  I want you to show me!
I want to feel what love is,  I know you can show me.

Vers 3:
I'm gonna take a little time,
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide, 
It looks like love has finally found me
Zwischenvers (wie oben):
In my life  there's been heartache and pain
I don't know   if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life.

Refrain (2 x):
I want to know what love is,  I want you to show me!
I want to feel what love is,  I know you can show me. (Repeat)
Variation Refrain (Chor und S"nger/S"ngerin im Wechsel):
Let's talk about love  (Chor: I want to know what love is)
Love that you feel inside  (Chor: I want you to show me)
I'm feelin' so much love  (Chor: I want to feel what love is)
No, you just can't it hide  (Chor: I know you can show me)
(Chor: I want to know what love is) - Let's talk about love
