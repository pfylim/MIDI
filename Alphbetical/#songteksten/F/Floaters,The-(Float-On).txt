Singer : THE FLOATERS 
Title  : FLOAT ON

(Words & music: Willis/Ingram/Mitchell)

Spoken:
Aquarius, and my name is Ralph
And I like a woman, who loves her freedom
And I like a woman, who can hold her own
And if you fit that description, baby
Come with me

Chorus:
Take my hand, come with me baby to love land
Let me show you how sweet it could be
Sharing love here with me
I want you to, float
Float on, float on, float on

Libra, and my name is Charles
Now I like a woman that's quiet
A woman who carries herself like
Miss Universe

Chorus: ...

Leo, and my name is Paul
You see, I like all women of the world
And if you understand what I'm saying
I want you to

Chorus: ...

Cancer, and my name is Larry
And I like a woman
That loves everything and everybody
And you know what, ladies?
If you feel that this is you
Then this is what I want you to do

Chorus: ...
