Title  : Fraction Too Much Friction
Singer : Tim Finn


There's a fraction, too much friction, mmm, yeah
Take a typical man, put him with a typical woman
Then sit back and watch everything slide
It's a perfectly natural expression of ill will
But when will hostilities subside
There's a fraction too much friction (2x)
Yeah

Don't believe in opposing factions
What we need is some positive action
There's a fraction too much friction (2x)
Yeah, oh yeah

It's a very old problem that
Goes back to the dark ages
The wages of original sin
Let's make it a better world
Let's shake it up boys and girls
It's never too late to begin
There's a fraction too much friction (2x)
Yeah

Men and women need each other
Should be like sister and brother
There's a fraction too much friction
Yeah, oh yeah

Looking for a man who will love his woman
Looking for a women who will love her man
I swallow my pride for you
My personal highs bore you
You're too wrapped up in your own world
I'm not a man for nothing
I gotta become someone
Inside this oyster there's a pearl
There's a fraction too much friction (2x)
Yeah

Holding on to the bygone era
Everybody shout 'cos we're getting nearer
There's a fraction too much friction yeah
What we need is positive action
What we need is some positive thought, yeah
