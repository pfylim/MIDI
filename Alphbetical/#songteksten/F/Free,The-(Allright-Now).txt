Intro: Guitar-Riff

Vers 1:
There she stood  in the street,
smiling from her head to her feet.
I said: "Hey, what is this?"
Now baby, maybe,  maybe she's in need of a kiss.
I said: "Hey, what's your name, baby?
Maybe we can see things the same.
Now don't you wait  or hesitate,
let's move before they raise the parking rate!"

All right now, baby, it's all right now
All right now, baby, it's all right now

Vers 2:
I took her home  to my place,
watching ev'ry move on her face.
She said: "Look, what's your game, baby?
Are you tryin' to put me in shame?"
I said: "Slow, don't go so fast,
don't you think that love can last?"
She said: "Love, Lord above, 
now you tryin' to trick me in love!"
