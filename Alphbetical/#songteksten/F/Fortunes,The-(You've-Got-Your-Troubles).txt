Singer : THE FORTUNES 
Title  : YOU'VE GOT YOUR TROUBLES

I see that worried look up on your face
You've got your troubles I've got mine
She's found somebody else to take your place
You've got your troubles I've got mine
I too have lost my love today
All of my dreams have flown away
Now just like you I sit and wonder why
You've got your troubles I've got mine

She used to love me that I know
And it don't seem so long ago
That we were walking
That we were talking the way that lovers do
And so forgive me if I seem unkind
And it must seem to you my friend
That I ain't got no pity for you
Well that ain't true
You see I loved that little girl,
Little girl, little girl
I'd helped another place another time
You've got your troubles I've got mine
