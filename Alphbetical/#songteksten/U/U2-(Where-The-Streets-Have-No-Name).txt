I wanna run I want to hide.
I wanna tear down the walls 
that hold me inside.
I wanna reach out, and touch the flame,
where the streets have no name.

Ha, ha , ha. I wanna feel sunlight on my face.
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace.
I wanna take shelter, from the poison rain,
where the streets have no name.

Ho ha where the streets have no name,
where the streets have no name.
We're still building then burning down love,
burning down love and when I go there,
I go there with you, it's all I can do.

The city's aflood and our love turns to rust.
We're beaten and blown by the wind,
trampled in dust.
I'll show you a place high on the desert plain,
yeah, where the streets have no name.
Ah ah where the streets have no name,
where the streets have no name.
We're still building then burning down love,
burning down love and when I go there,
I go there with you, it's all I can do.

Our love turns to rust,
we're beaten and blown by the wind,
blown by the wind.
Oh and I see love, see our love turn to rust.
Ah we're beaten and blown by the wind,
blown by the wind.
Oh when I go there, I go there with you,
it's all I can do.
