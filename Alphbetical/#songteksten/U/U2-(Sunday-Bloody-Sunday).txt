U2 - SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY


I can't believe the news today
I can't close my eyes and make it go away
How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? Tonight we can be as one
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't need the battle call
It puts my back up, puts my back
up against the wall

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won?
The trenches dub within our hearts
And mother's children, brothers, sisters torn apart

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

How long, how long must we sing this song?
How long? Tonight we can be as one
Tonight, tonight

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
Wipe your bloodshot eyes

Sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday

And it's true we are immune
When fact is friction and T.V. is reality
And today the millions cry
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
The real battle just began
To claim the victory Jesus won
On a sunday, bloody sunday
Sunday, bloody sunday
