U2 - THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE

Ice your only rivers run gold
These city lights they shine as silver and gold
Dug from the night your eyes as black as coal

Walk on by walk on through
Walk 'til you run and don't look back
For here I am carnival the wheels fly
And the colors spin through alcohol
Red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place

Walk on by walk on through
So sad to besiege your love so head on
Stay in this time stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking but I think you know
Come on take me away
Come on take me home (2x)
Home again

And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea not a tear no not I

Stay in this time stay tonight in a lie
Ever after this love in time
And if you save your love
Save it all (2x)
Don't push me too far (2x)

Tonight (3x)
