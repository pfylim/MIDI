UB40 & CHRISSIE HYNDE - BREAKFAST IN BED

(Words & music: Eddie Hinton/Connie Fritts)

You've been crying
Your face is a mess
Come in baby
You can dry the tears on my dress
She's hurt you again
I can tell
Oh I know that look so well

Don't be shy
You've been here before
Pull your shoes off
Lie down and I will lock the door
And not one has to know
You've come here again
Darlin' it will be like it's always been

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
And nothin' need be said

What's your hurry
Please don't eat and run
You can let her wait
My darling it's been so long
Since I've had you here
Please come again
Darlin' it will be like it's always been

Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
You don't have to say you love me
Breakfast in bed
And nothin' need be said
Breakfast in bed and a kiss or three
