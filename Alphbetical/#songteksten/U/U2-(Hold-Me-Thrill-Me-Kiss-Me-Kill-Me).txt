8. HOLD ME, THRILL ME, KISS ME, KILL ME - U2

You don't know how you took it
you just know what you got
Oh Lawdy you've been stealing
From the thieves
And you got caught in the headlights
Of a stretched car
You're the star.

Dressing like your sister
Living like a tart
If they don't know what you're doing
Baby it must be art
Your headache in a suitcase
You're the star

Don't be shy
you don't have to go blind
Hold me thrill me
Kiss me Kill me

You don't know how you got here
You just know you want out
Believing in yourself
Almost as much as you doubt
You're a big smash
You wear it like a rash star

Don't be shy
You need a crowd to cry
Hold m thrill me
Kiss me Kill me

They want you to be Jesus
They'll go down on one knee
But they'll want their money back
If you're alive at 33
And you're turning tricks
With your crucifix
You're a star

Don't be shy
You don't have to deny your love
Hold me Thrill me
Kiss me, Kill me
