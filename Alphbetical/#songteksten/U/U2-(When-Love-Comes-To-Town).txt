U2 - WHEN LOVE COMES TO TOWN

BONO:
Hey yeah-yeah hey yeah yeah-yeah
I was a sailor I was lost at sea
I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

B.B. KING:
Love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

BONO:
I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was as pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

B.B. KING:
When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town
I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town
I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

BONO:
