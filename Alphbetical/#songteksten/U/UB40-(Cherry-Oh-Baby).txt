UB 40 - CHERRY OH BABY

Cherry oh Cherry oh baby
Don't you know I'm in need of thee?
If you don't believe it's true
What have you left me to do
So long I've been waiting for you to
come right in
And now that we are together
Please make my joy run over

Refrain:
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh ee ohh oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh
yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh ee ohh oh oh ee oh ee oh ee oh
yeah yeah yeah
oh yeah

Cherry oh Cherry oh baby
Don't you know I'm in love with you?
If you don't believe I do
Then why don't you try me?
I'm never gonna let you down
Never make you wear no-frown
If you say you love me madly
Then I will receive you gladly

Never make you wear no-frown
You say you love me madly
Then why do you treat me badly?
