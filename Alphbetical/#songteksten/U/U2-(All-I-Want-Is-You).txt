U2 - ALL I WANT IS YOU

(Words & music: U2)

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want your story to remain untold

But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you
You say you'll give me a highway
With no one on it
Treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night 
You say you'll give me eyes in a moon of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When All I want is you

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold
All the promises we break 
From the cradle to the grave
When All I want is you

Oh you-ooh
All I want is you-ooh
All I want is you-ooh
All I want is you-ooh
