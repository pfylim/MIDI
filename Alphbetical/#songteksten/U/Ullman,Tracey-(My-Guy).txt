TRACY ULLMAN - MY GUY

My guy's mad at me
I didn't want to see the film tonight
I found it hard to say
He thought I'd had enough of him

Why can't he see
He's lovely to me
But I like to stay and watch tv
On my own every now and then

Refrain:
My guy's mad at me
Been on the telephone for an hour
We hardly said a word
I tried and tried but I could not be heard

Why can't he explain
Why do I feel this pain
'Cause everything I say he doesn't understand
He doesn't realize he takes it all the wrong way

My guy's mad at me
We argued just the other night
I thought we'd got it straight
We talked and talked until it was light
I thought we'd agreed
I thought we'd talked it out
But when I try to speak
He says that I don't care
He says I'm unaware
And now he says I'm weak

Refrain: ...

My guy's mad at me
We argued just the other night
I thought we'd got it straight
