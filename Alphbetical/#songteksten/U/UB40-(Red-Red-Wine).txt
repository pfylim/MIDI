Red ,red wine ,goes to my head,
Makes me forget that I still need her so.
Red, red wine, it's up to you, all I can do, I've done,
Mem'ries won't go, mem'ries won't go.

I'd have thought that with time
Thoughts of you.
Would leave my head.
I was wrong, now I find
Just one thing
Makes me forget.

Red, red wine,
Stay close to me,
Don't let me be alone,
It's tearin'apart,
My blue, blue heart.

I'd have thought
That with time
Thoughts of you 
Would leave my head...

Red, red wine,
Stay close to me,
Don't let me be alone,
It's tearin' apart 
My blue ,blue heart.
