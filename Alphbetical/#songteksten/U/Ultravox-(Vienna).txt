Title  : VIENNA
Artist : ULTRAVOX

(Words & music: Ultravox)

We walked in the cold air
Freezing breath on the window pain
Lying and waiting
A man in the dark in the picture frame
So mystic and soulful
A voice reaching out and a piercing cry
It stays with you until the feeling is gone
Only you and I, this means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh Vienna
Music is weaving, haunting notes, pizzicato strings
The rhythm is calling
Alone in the night as the daylight brings a cold empty silence
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky
It fades to the distance, the image is gone
Only you and I, this means nothing to me
This means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
Nothing to me, this means nothing to me
Oh, Vienna
