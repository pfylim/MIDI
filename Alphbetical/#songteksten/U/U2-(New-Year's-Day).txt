Title  : New Year's Day
Singer : U2


All is quiet on New Year's day
A world in white gets under way
And I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
On New Year's day
I will be with you again (2x)

Under a blood red sky
A crowd has gathered, in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
The newspaper says, it says it's true, it's true
And we can break through
Though torn in two we can be one
I, I will begin again (2x)

Oh, and maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight
I will be with you again (2x)

And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
On New Year's day (2x)
