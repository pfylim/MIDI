          Senza una donna              Zucchero & Paul Young


I change the world, I change the world - ooh, ooh!
I change the world, I wanna change the world - ooh, ooh!

This ain't the way I spend my mornings, baby.
Come es-tai? You've been with him, now you come back, my lady.
What's he like?

I just sit and watch the ocean by myself. Even so my own cook, yeah.
You can laugh and you're forgiven, but I'm no longer frightened to be living - 

Refrain

Senza una donna - no more pain and no sorrow,
Senza una donna - I make it through tomorrow.
Senza una donna - giving me torture and bliss,
Without a woman - I better like this.

Yeah, there is no way that you can buy me baby, Don't make fun.
You got to think a little deeper lady, In the heart? - Yeah, if you have one.

Here's my heart, feel the power, Look at me, look at me - I'm a flower.
You can laugh and you're forgiven but, I'm no longer frightened to be living - 

Refrain

Senza una donna ...

I stay here and watch the ocean, Don't know why I keep on talking.
You may laugh you're forgiven, but I'm no longer frightened to be living - 

Refrain

Senza una donna ...
