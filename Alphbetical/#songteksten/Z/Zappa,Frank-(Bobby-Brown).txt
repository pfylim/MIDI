Hey there people I'm Bobby Brown,
They say I'm the cutest boy in town,
My car is fast my teeth is shiny
I tell the girls they can kiss my hiney.

Here I am at a famous school
I'm dressing sharp and I'm actin cool
I got a cheer leader here
want's to help me with my paper
Let her do all the work
And maybe later I'll rap her

Oh God I am the American dream
I do not think I'm to extreme
An' I'm a handsome son of a bitch
I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich
Get a good get a good get a good get a good.

Woman's liberation
Came creepin' all the nation
I tell you people I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddy.

She made a little speach then
As she tried to make me say when
she has my balls in a vise
But she left the dick I guess it's still hocked on
But now it shoots too quick

Oh God I am the American dream

But now I smell like vaseline
And I'm a miserable son of a bitch
I'm a boy or a lady I don't know which
I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder.

So I went out and bought me a lesure suit
I jingle my change but I'm still kind a cute
Got a job doin' the radio promo,
And none of the Jock's can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me and a friend
Sorta drifted along in to S. and M.
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I gets a little golden shower

Oh God I am the American dream
With a spindle up but still it amkes me scream
And I do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights sayin' "Thank you Fred"
Oh God oh God I'm so fantatsic
Thank's to Freddie I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is Bobbie Brown.

Watch me now I'm goin' down
And my name is Bobbie Brown.
Watch me now I'm goin' down.
And my name is Bobbie Brown.

Watch me now - I'm goin' down.
