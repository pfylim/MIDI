Don't know much about dancin'
that's why I got this song
one of my llegs is shorter than the other
'n' both my feet's to long
'course now right along with 'em
I got no natural rhythm
but I go dancin' fool, I'm a dancin' fool
I hear that beat; I jump outa my seat,
but I can't compete, 'cause I'm a
dancin' fool, I'm a dancin' fool.

The disco folks all dressed up
like they's fit to kill
I walk on in 'n' see 'em there
gonna give them all a thrill
when they see me comin'
they all step aside
they has a fit while I commit
my social suicide, I'm a
dancin' fool, I'm a dancin' fool
the beat goes on and I'm so wrong ,...
I may be totally wrong, but I'm a
dancin' fool, dancin' fool.

I got it all together now
with my very own disco clothes, hey !
My shirt's half open, t'show you my chains
'n' the spoon for up my nose
I am really somethin'
that's what you'd prob'ly say
so smoke your little smoke
drink your little drink
while I dance the night away, I'm a 
dancin' fool, I'm a dancin' fool.

I may be totally wrong but I'm a,...
FOOL-uh !
Hey, darlin'...can I buy ya a drink ?
Lookin' for Mister Goodbar ? Here he is...
wait a minute...I've got it...you're an Italian !
Hah ? Yer Jewish ? 
Love your nails...you must be a Libra...
your place or mine ?
