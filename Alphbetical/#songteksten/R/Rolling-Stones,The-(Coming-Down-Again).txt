Singer : THE ROLLING STONES 
Title  : COMING DOWN AGAIN

Coming down again, coming down again, coming down again
Share your thoughts there's nothing you can hide
She was dying to survive
I was caught, oh taken for a ride
She was showing no surprise
Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends, coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again
On the ground again, going down again

Slipped my tongue in someone else's pie
tasting better every time
She turned green and tried to make me cry
Being hungry ain't no time

Coming down again, all my times have been spent
Coming down again, coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again
Where are all my friends, coming down again
Coming down again, coming down again
On the ground again, going down again
