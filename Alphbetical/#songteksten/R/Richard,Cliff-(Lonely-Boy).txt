Interpret: Cliff Richard

I'm just a lonely boy, lonely in blue
I'm all alone, with nothing to do

I've got everything, you could think of
But all I want, is someone to love

Someone, yes someone to love, someone to kiss
Someone to hold, that I'm hold on like this
I like to hear, somebody say
I give you my love, each  night and day

I'm just a lonely boy, lonely in blue
I'm all alone, with nothing to do

I've got everything, you could think of
But all I want, is someone to love

Somebody, somebody, somebody please, sending to me
I'll make her happy, just when I see
I place so hard, to the heavens above
and I'm gonna find, someone to love
