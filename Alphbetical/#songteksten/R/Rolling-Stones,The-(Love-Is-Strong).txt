LOVE IS STRONG
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET
YOU MAKE ME HARD
YOU MAKE ME WEAK
LOVE IS STRONG
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET
AND SOME DAY, BABE
WE'VE GOT TO MEET

A GLIMPSE OF YOU
WAS ALL IT TOOK
A STRANGER'S GLANCE
IT GOT ME HOOKED
AND I FOLLOWED YOU
ACROSS THE STARS
I LOOKED FOR YOU
IN SEEDY BARS

WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF, BABY
IT'S MORE THEN JUST A DREAM
I NEED A BEAUTIFUL TEAM
A BEAUTIFUL TEAM

LOVE IS STRONG
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET
AND SOME DAY, BABE
WE GOT TO MEET
JUST ANYWHERE
OUT IN THE PARK
OUT IN THE STREET
AND IN THE DARK
I FOLLOWED YOU
THROUGH SWIRLING SEAS
DOWN DARKENED WOODS
WITH SILENT TREES

YOUR LOVE IS STRONG
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET
YOU MAKE ME HARD
YOU MAKE ME WEAK

WHAT ARE SCARED OF, BABY
IT'S MORE THAN JUST A DREAM
I NEED SOME TIME
WE MAKE A BEAUTIFUL TEAM
BEAUTIFUL

I WAIT FOR YOU
UNTIL THE DAWN
MY MIND IS RIPPED
MY HEART IS TORN

YOUR LOVE IS STRONG
AND YOU'RE SO SWEET
YOUR LOVE IS BITTER
IT'S TAKEN NEAT
LOVE IS STRONG, YEAH
(REPEAT AND FADE OUT)
