C'mon pretty baby
Let's move it and groove it
Let's shake all baby shake, my honey, beat, don't lose it
The rhythm that gets into your heart and soul
Let me tell you baby it's called rock 'n' roll

They say it's gonna die but honey, beat, let's face it
When they just don't know what's gonna to replace it
Hell as I could live as I've got nothing on 
The real country music that just drives me along
Better move it

Mm, Mm.
