(Words & music: Chris Rea)

A dying flame, you're free again

They're only dreams
Save your crying for the day
It may not come, but anyone who had to pay
Would laugh at you and say

Because you said goodbye
Fool, if you think it's over

Newborn eyes always cry with pain
At the first look at the morning sun
It's just begun

Miss teenage dream, such a traffic scene
He knocked your crown and ran away
First wound of pride and how you cried and cried
But save your tears, you've years 'n years
I'll buy your first good wine
We'll have a real good time
And save our crying for the day
That may not come
But anyone who had to pay
Would laugh at you and say

Chorus: ...
