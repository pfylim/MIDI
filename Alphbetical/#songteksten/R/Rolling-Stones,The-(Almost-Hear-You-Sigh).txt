Title  : Almost Hear You Sigh
Singer : Rolling Stones


I can almost hear you sigh
I can almost hear you cry
On every crowded street
All the places we would meet

What will I do without you
They say that life goes on
I'm feeling sorry for myself
I can't believe you're gone

You acted much too calm
You turned on all your charm
You had a cold look in your eyes
I can feel your tongue on mine
Silky smooth like wine
I'm living with these memories
That's all that's left of you and me

I can almost hear your sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
And you turned on all the charm
Acted much too calm
You had a cold look in your eyes

Did it mean nothing
Was it all in vain
Was I just your fool
Or was the pleasure pain

Have you set me free
Or will I wake up
In the morning
And find out it's been a bad dream
Come on, I beg you
I want to be your main man

I can almost hear you sigh
Almost hear you cry
When you made sweet love to me
Almost see your smile
I stretched half a mile
You had a stone cold look in your eyes
