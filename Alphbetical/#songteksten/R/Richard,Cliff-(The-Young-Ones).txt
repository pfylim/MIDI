                THE     YOUNG    ONES

            The young ones, darling we're the young ones

            And young ones shouldn't be afraid

            To live, love, while the flame is strong

            For we,  won't be the young ones

            Very long



            Tomorrow, why wait till tomorrow

            tomorrow, sometimes never comes

            So love,  me,  there's a song to be sung

            And the best time, is to sing it, while we're young


            ONCE IN EVRY LIFETIME, COMES A LOVE LIKE THIS

            I NEED YOU AND YOU NEED ME

            OH MY DARLING CAN'T YOU SEE


            Young dreams, should be dreamed together

            Young hearts, shouldn't be afraid

            And some, day,  when the years have flown,

            Darling than we'll, teach the young ones,

            Of our own

            REFREIN
