
11. YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME - RESTLESS HEART

Chorus:
Just as long as that old river flows,
The sun comes up and that north wind blows.
Just as sure as these are guaranteed
Honey, you can depend on me.

This day and time lovers come and go.
When it seems there‹s no one left to hold.
For so many when the morning comes around,
Girl, you can bet, this old boy can‹t be found

Chorus

Together, never to part.
Forever, you can bet your heart.

Chorus

Together, never to part.
Forever, you can bet your heart.

Chorus

Together and forever in sweet harmony
You can depend on me.
