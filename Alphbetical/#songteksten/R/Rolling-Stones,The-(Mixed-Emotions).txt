Title  : Mixed Emotions
Singer : Rolling Stones


Button your lip baby
Button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Go for the throat
Let's bury the hatchet
Wipe out the past
Make love together
Stay on the path

Chorus 1:
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only ship
Adrift on this ocean

This coming and going
Is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing
Is hurting my guts
So get off the fence
It's creasing your butt
Life is a party
Let's get out and strut

Chorus 2: Chorus 1+:
You're not the only one
That's feeling lonesome
You're not the only one
With mixed emotions
You're not the only one (4 x)

Let's grab the world
By the scruff of the neck
And drink it down deeply
Let's love it to death
So button your lip
And button your coat
Let's go out dancing
Let's rock 'n 'roll

Chorus 2


Words & Music : Jagger, Richards
