Title  : DO YOUR DANCE

(Words & music: N. Whitfield/D. Turner)

Chorus:
Do your dance to the rhythm of the drum
Yes, having fun

We're gonna start at midnight
Party 'til the mornin' light
We are never gonna stop
Until we get it right
Ain't that right, ain't that right

Chorus: ...

Well there's a message on your body
To this song
Can't you feel it's tellin' you
Let's get it on
Let's get it on, get on up

Chorus: ...

I want everybody to get on down
Touch your shoes
You're looking good
Put your head on your heels

Chorus: ...

Good music makes you feel like this
Don't it make you feel it, baby
Don't it make you wanna get down
Good music, shake it out, shake it out

We're gonna start at midnight
Party 'til the mornin' light
We are never gonna stop
Until we get it right
Ain't that right, ain't that right

Do your dance to the rhythm on the floor
Havin' fun
