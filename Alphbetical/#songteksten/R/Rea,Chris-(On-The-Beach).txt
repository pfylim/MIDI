7. ON THE BEACH - CHRIS REA

Intro

1. Strophe:
Between these eyes of love I call your name
Behind these guarded wall I used to go
Upon a summer wind   there's a certain melody
Takes me back  to the place  that I know  on the beach.

Yeah, yeah, down on the beach
Yeah

2. Strophe:
The secrets of the summer  I will keep
The sand of time will blow a mystery
No one but you and I  underneath that moonlit sky
Take me back  to the place  that I know  on the beach.

Yeah, yeah, down on the beach
Yeah, down on the beach
On the beach,
Yeah, yeah, on the beach .... 

Instrumental 

3. Strophe:
Forever in my dreams  my heart will be
Hanging on to this sweet memory
A day of strange desire  and a night that burned like fire
Take me back  to the place  that I know  on the beach

Yeah, yeah, down on the beach
Yeah, down on the beach
On the beach, 
Yeah, yeah, on the beach

Instrumental
