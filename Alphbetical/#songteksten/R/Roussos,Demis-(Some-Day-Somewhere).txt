Title  : SOME DAY SOMEWHERE

Someday somewhere you said hello
And walked into my life
Painted all my world in blue
Made my life a dream come true
Someday somewhere I held your hand
And suddenly I knew
That your love could show the way
To my rainbow's end
You gave my heart eternity
Shared my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a symphony
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday somewhere you said hello
And walked into my life
All so unexpected all so very tenderly
Someday somewhere I held your hand
And suddenly I knew
That your love could show the way
To my rainbow's end
You gave my heart a song to sing
Shared my wild imaginings
Time for us was sunshine never ending
Each morning was a melody
Simple words and harmony
And you were all my eyes could wish to see

Someday somewhere our song went by and
left us standing there
Silently you walked away
Leaving me with yesterdays
Someday somewhere we'll meet again
And we'll pretend in vain
Trying to convince ourselves
Our love was just a game, game, game
