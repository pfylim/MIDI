MARSHA RAVEN - CATCH ME (I'M FALLING IN LOVE)

I spent my whole life searching and
Though I found someone who's love
I could demand
I don't know what to do
I need a helping hand

Refrain:
Catch me I'm falling in love (3x)
Falling in love with you
Catch me I'm falling in love (3x)

Hold me in your arms
Only you can save me
Come and rescue me

Catch me I'm falling in love (3x)

I need you, I want you
Come on and hold me
Squeeze me, touch me, love me, oh
