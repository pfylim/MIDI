Title  : HEAVEN ON EARTH

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Heah this is heaven on earth and it's riding to you
Heaven on earth and we're inviting you to
Come to the station to meet this sensation
Eight o'clock tonight

We'll sing you out of your head
And give you the best evening
That you've ever had

And even more 'cause you better do believe
The boys in the band sure
Will give us a hand
Play you things you will like

These chicks are out of sight
Singing their songs for you
They'll give you dynamite 
Doing the dance they do

You should hear these guys 
When they're playing the blues
The rhythms and the gents 
Will beat you out off your shoes

This is heaven on earth and it's coming to you
Heaven on earth and we're inviting you to
Come to meet this sensation
Eight o'clock tonight

These chicks are out of sight
Singing their songs for you
They'll give you dynamite 
Doing the dance they do

You should hear these guys 
When they're playing the blues
The rhythms and the gents 
Will beat you out off your shoes

This is heaven on earth and it's coming to you
Heaven on earth and we're inviting you to
Come to meet this sensation
Eight o'clock tonight

We'll sing you out of your head
And give you the best evening
That you've ever had

And even more 'cause you better do believe
