  13. THAT ROCK WON'T ROLL - RESTLESS HEART
  
  Every little move she makes
  Is going to catch somebody's eye.
  You ought to see all the double takes
  When she goes walking by
  But she's so distant
  She seems so cold
  Everybody says
  
  That rock won't roll  They say the girl's
  Got a heart of stone  That rock won't roll
  Oh, but she's too pretty  To be alone
  I've got all this love inside me
  And I've just got to see
  If that rock won't roll.
  
  I'll give her everything I've got
  I'm gonna change her point of view
  I keep trying and I won't stop
  Until the love in her eyes shines through
  And when I show her this heart of gold
  Then we'll see
  
  I've got all this love inside me
  And I've just got to see
  If that rock won't roll
  Oh, she's so pretty
  But that rock won't roll
  And I've just got to see
  If that rock won't roll
  That rock won't roll...
