Night comes down and finds you alone
in a space in time of our own.
Lost in dreams in a world full of shadows.
Down the streets the neon light shines
off'ring refuge and hope to the blind,
you stumble in with no thought of tomorrow.

Yes I get lonely when the sun gets low,
and I end up looking for somewhere to go.
Yes, I should know better, but I can't say "no".
Oh no no no no no no no.

The lights are low and the music is loud
you watch yourself as you play to the crowd
one more face in a palace of mirrors.
One more drink you're stealing away
one more dream, but it's looking okay,
one more time to watch the flow of the river.

Yes, I get lonely when the sun gets low,
and I end up looking for somewhere to go.
Yes, I should know better, but I can't say "No".
Oh no no no no no no no no no no,...
