Intro

Well, I told you once and I told you twi-ice 
But you never listen to my advi-ice
You don't try very hard to please me 
With what you know, it should be easy

Refrain:
Well, this could be the last time, this could be the last time.
Maybe the last time, I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Well, I'm sorry girl, but I can't stay-ay 
feelin' like I do today-ay
It's too much pain and too much sorrow 
guess I'll feel the same tomorrow 

Refrain:
Well, this could be the last time, this could be the last time.
Maybe the last time, I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Refrain:
Well, this could be the last time, this could be the last time.
Maybe the last time, I don't know
Oh no
Oh no

Well, I told you once and I told you twi-ice
That someone will have to pay the pri-ice
But here's a chance to change your mi-ind
'cause I'll be gone a long, long ti-ime

Refrain:
Well, this could be the last time, this could be the last time.
Maybe the last time, I don't know- (Break, 1 Takt nur Tambourin)
Oh no 
Oh no

Last time, baby! (The last time), Baby, I'll go!
(Baby, the last time) Well, I don't go! 
(Baby, the last time) Well, I don't go! 

Repeat and fade away
