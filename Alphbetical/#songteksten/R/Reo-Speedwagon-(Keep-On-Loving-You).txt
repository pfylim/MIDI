Title  : KEEP ON LOVING YOU
Artist : REO SPEEDWAGON

(Words & music: Kevin Cronin)

You should have seen by the look in my eyes babe
There was something missing
You should have known by the tone of my voice
Maybe, but you didn't listen
You played death
But you never bled in stead of you land
Still in the grass
All coiled up and his sin'
And tho' I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us baby
Way before then and we're still together
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you
I meant that I love you forever

Chorus:
And I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you, loving you
Baby I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep
I just wanna keep on loving you
