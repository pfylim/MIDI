Title  : UPSIDE DOWN
Artist : DIANA ROSS

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

I said upside down
You're turnin' me
You're givin' love instinctively
Round and round you're turning me

Chorus:
Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out and round and round
Upside down
Boy you turn me
Inside out and round and round

Instinctively you give to me
The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheatin'
When no one makes me feel like you do

Chorus: ...

I know you got charm and appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy to think you are mine
As long as the sun
Continues to shine
There's place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line

Chorus: ...

Instinctively you give to me
The love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I say to thee
I'm aware that you're cheatin'
When no one makes me feel like you do

Chorus: ...2x...

Upside down you're turnin' me
You give your love instinctively
Round and round you're turnin' me
I say to thee respectfully
(...4x...)

Upside down you're turnin' me
