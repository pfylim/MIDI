CHRIS REA - JOSEPHINE

There's rain on my window
But I'm thinking of you
Tears on my pillow
But I will come through

Josephine, I'll send you all my love
And ev'ry single step I take
I'll take for you
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
Josephine, I'll send you all my love

Now there's a storm on my radio
But I can still fly
But you are the reason
For the blue in my sky

Josephine, I'll send you all my love
Josephine

Life without meaning
I was walking away
In the coldest of winters
The night becomes day

Josephine, I'll send you all my love
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
Josephine
