
Under the boardwalk            Rolling Stones


Oh when the sun is down
and when the tear's up on the roof's
And your shoes get so hot
You wish two tired feed will fly you proof
Under the boardwalk down by the sea
On a blanked with my baby, is where I'll be

Under the boardwalk   out of the sun
Under the boardwalk   we'll be having some fun
Under the boardwalk   people walking of all
Under the boardwalk   we'll be making in love
Under the boardwalk   boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste 
A hotdog and frites fry they'd sale

Under the boardwalk...

Solo

Under the boardwalk...
