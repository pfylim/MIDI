Singer : ROLLING STONES
Title  : EMOTIONAL RESCUE

(Words & music: Mick Jagger, Keith Richard)

Is there nothing I can say
Nothing I can do, to change your mind?
I'm so in love with you
You're too  deep in
You can't get out
You're just a poor girl in a rich man's world

Chorus:
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Yeah baby I'm crying over you

Don't you know promises where never made to keep
Just like the night they dissolve in sleep
I'll be your saviour steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah, in the night I'm crying, crying baby
Yeah, crying
Yeah, I'm crying baby
I'm like a child, baby
Like a child, yeah, so like a child
Like a child, like a child

You think you're one of a special breed
You think that you're his pet pekinese
I'll be saviour, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah, in the night I'm crying, crying baby
Yeah, crying
Yeah, I'm crying baby
I'm like a child, baby
Like a child, yeah, so like a child
Like a child, like a child

I was dreaming last night babe
Last night I was dreaming, how you'd be mine
But I was crying like a child
You will be mine mine mine mine all mine
You could be mine, could be mine, could be mine, all mine

I come to you so silent in the night
So stealthy so animal quiet
I'll be your saviour, steadfast and true
I'll come to your emotional rescue
I'll come to your emotional rescue
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah, in the night I'm crying, crying baby
Yeah, crying
Yeah, I'm crying baby
I'm like a child, baby
Like a child, yeah, so like a child
Like a child, like a child

Yeah you should be mine, mine oh

Yes you could be mine
Tonight and every night
I will be your knight in shining armour
Coming to your emotional rescue
You will be mine, you will be mine
All mine (repeat)

I will be your knight in shining armour
Riding across the desert with a fine arab charger
