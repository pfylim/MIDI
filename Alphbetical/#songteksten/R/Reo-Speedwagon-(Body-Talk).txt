Title  : BODY TALK
Artist : REO SPEEDWAGON

(Words & music: Tony Swain/Steve Jolley/Lee John/Ashley Ingram)

Morning afternoon and night
We lay together side by side
Searching for lust, searching for breath
Searching for the touch of life
No words are spoken, the only sound we hear is
Body talk, body talk

The heat of passion is such a beautiful thing
As it overflows, pleasure grows
All the dreams it can bring
Your lips and your eyes and gently sighs with
Body talk, body talk

Cool and calm, so soft and pure
A touching moment
Hidden feelings once explored
But have melted
We were two souls torn apart
With bitter edges
Ture expression, not aggression
We have become one
Body talk, body talk

(repeat)

Searching for lust, searching for breath
Searching for the touch of life
No words are spoken, the only sound we hear is
Body talk, body talk
