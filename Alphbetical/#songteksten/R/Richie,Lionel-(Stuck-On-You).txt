LIONEL RICHIE - STUCK ON YOU

Stuck on you
I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
That I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now
I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed

I'm stuck on you
Been a fool too long
I guess it's time for me to come on home
Guess I'm on my way
So hard to see
That a woman like you
Could wait around for a man like me
Guess I'm on my way
Might glad you stayed

Oh I'm leaving on that
Midnight train tomorrow
And I know just where I'm going
I've packed up by troubles
And I've thrown them all away
'Cause this time little darling
I'm coming home to say
I'm stuck on you

I've got this feeling down deep in my soul
That I just can't lose
Guess I'm on my way
Needed a friend
And the way I feel now
I guess I'll be with you 'til the end
Guess I'm on my way
Mighty glad you stayed
