Title  : IS IT LOVE YOU'RE AFTER

(Words & music: Miles Gregory)

Sometimes you get away from me
And you want my company, yes, you do baby
So I drive for miles to be where you are
I know each time I go I give a little of me away
Each time baby
Tell me am I the fool who came to town

Chorus:
Ah, baby is it love you're after
Or just a good time
Tell me baby, is it love, is it love
Is it love you're after
Or just a good time

I don't need a thrill to make me feel
What I already have, pretty baby
I just want something real
When it all goes down
Can I believe
Put my trust in love of ours I've found
Can I honey
Do I have to ride the merry-go-round

Chorus: ...

Do you see me for who I am
Do you find me easy
Do you love me enough
To want to stand beside me
Guide me oh is it

Chorus: ...

Soon you'll see me for who I am
etc.
