Vers 1:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was born in a crossfire hurricane,
and I howled at my ma in the driving rain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
But it's alright now.
In fact it's a gas.
But it's alright.
I'm a Jumpin' Jack Flash.
It's a gas, gas, gas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was raised by a toothless bearded hag.
I was schooled with a strap right across my back.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
But it's alright...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 3:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was drowned. I was washed up and left for dead.
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled.
And I fowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread.
I was crowned with a spike right through my head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
But it's alright...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
