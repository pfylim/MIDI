My sweet Lady Jane 
when I see you again
Your servant am I
and with humbly remain
just hit this plea my love
On bended knees my love
I pledge myselfe to Lady Jane.
My dear Lady Anne
I've done what I can
I must take my leave
for promised I am
this play is run my love
your time has come my love
I've pledge my troth to Lady Jane.
Oh my sweet Marie
I wait at your ease
The sands have run out
For your lady and me.
Wedlock is night my love
Her station's right my love
life is secure with Lady Jane.
