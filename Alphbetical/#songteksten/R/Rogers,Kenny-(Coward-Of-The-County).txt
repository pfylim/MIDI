  6. COWARD OF THE COUNTY - KENNY ROGERS
  
  Everyone considered him  The coward of the county
  He never stood one single time To prove the county wrong
  His mama called him Tommy But folks just called him yellow
  Something always told me They were reading Tommy wrong.
  
  Now he was only ten years old  When his daddy died in prison
  And I took care of Tommy  'Cause he was my brother's son
  I still recall the final words  My brother said to Tommy
  Son, my life is over  But yours is just begun.
  
  Promise me, son  Not to do the things I've done
  Walk away from trouble if you can
  Now, it don't mean you're weak If you turn the other cheek
  And I hope you're old enough to understand
  Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.
  
  There's someone for everyone Tommy's love was Becky
  In her arms he didn't have  To prove he was a man
  One day while he was working The Cattelin boys came calling
  They took turns at Becky  And there were three of them.
  
  Tommy opened up the door  And saw his Becky crying
  The torn dress the shattered look Was more than he could stand
  He reached above the fireplace Took down his daddy's picture
  As the tears fell on his daddy's face  I heard these words again.
  
  The Cattelin boys just laughed at him When he walked into the barman
  One of them got up  And hit him half way across the floor
  Tommy turned around they said  Hey, look old yellow's leaving
  You could have heard a pin drop  When Tommy stopped and locked the
  door.
  Twenty years of crawling  Was bottled up inside him
  He wasn't holding nothing back  He let them have it all
  When Tommy left the barroom  Not a Cattelin boy was standing
  He said this once for Becky  As he watched the last one fall.
  And I heard him say
  I promised you Dad   Not to do the things you've done.....enzv.
