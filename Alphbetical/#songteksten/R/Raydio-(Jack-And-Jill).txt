Title  : JACK AND JILL

(Words & music: Ray Parker jr)

Jack, wanting someone to feel
Sat up on a hill
And waited all day for Jill
Jill, always away from home
Never bothering to phone
Always leaving poor Jack alone

Chorus:
Now why do you think
Jack snuck down the hill
He needed love
Love he couldn't get from Jill

Chorus: ...

Jack, like little red ridinghood
Always trying to do good
Waited as long as he could

Jill, is this right or wrong
For Jack to carry on
If you leave him home too long

Chorus: ...
