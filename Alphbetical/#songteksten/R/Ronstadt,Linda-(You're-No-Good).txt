Title  : YOU'RE NO GOOD

Feelin' better now that we're thru
Feelin' better 'cause I'm over you
I learned my lesson it left a scar
But now I see how you really are
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good
I'm gonna say it again, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good
Baby you're no good

Broke a heart gentle and true
Left a boy for some-one like you
I'll beg his forgiveness on bended knee
But I wouldn't blame him if he said to me
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good, baby you're no good
I wanna say it again, you're no good
You're no good, you're no good

If he'll have me we'll start anew
It'll be easy forgetting you
You're no good, you're no good
You're no good, baby you're no good
I wanna say it again, you're no good
You're no good, baby you're no good
