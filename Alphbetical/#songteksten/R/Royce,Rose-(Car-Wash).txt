Title  : CAR WASH

(Words & music: Norman Whitfield)

Wooh, you might not ever get rich
But let me tell ya
It's better than digging a ditch
There ain't no telling who ya might meet
A movie star or maybe even an Indian chief

Refrain:
Workin' at the car wash, yeah
Come on and sing it with me
Car wash
Get with the feelin' y'all
Car wash, yeah

Come summer the work gets kinda hard
This ain't no place to be
If ya planned on being a star
Let me tell you, it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes
If ya act a fool at the

Car wash
Talkin' about the car wash yeah
Come on and sing it with me
Car wash
Get with the feelin' y'all
Car wash yeah

(Work and work) Well those cars never seem to stop comin'
(Work and work) Keep those rags and machines hummin'
(Work and work) My fingers to the bone
(Work) At five I can't wait 'til it's time to go home
Hey get your car washed today
Fill up and you don't have to pay
Come on and give us a play
Get a wash right away

Those cars never seem to stop comin'
Keep those rags and machines hummin'
Let me tell you, it's always cool
And the boss don't mind sometimes
If ya act a fool at the

Car wash, workin' at the car wash yeah
