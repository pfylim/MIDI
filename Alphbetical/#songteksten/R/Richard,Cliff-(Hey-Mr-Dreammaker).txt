Title  : HEY, MR. DREAMMAKER

(Words & music: Bruce Wich/Alan Tarney)

Josey's gone now
She cried a lot
Had to go away
And though I miss her
I wanna kiss her
Ain't it just the way
But it's no way at all
'Cause if you knew
What I'm going through
You'd know
There's one thing wrong
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josey no more

She didn't say much
Just a little touch
And she was on her way
Ooh, I could-a cry then
Instead of died then
She left me standing dazed
But it's no use crying
Well, that's what
Everybody tells me
And they all seem to know
But there's one thing I know
With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josey no more

Hey, mr Dreammaker
Send me a dream
This one is over
It's not what it seems
And so tonight
When I turn out the light
Send me a new dream tonight
