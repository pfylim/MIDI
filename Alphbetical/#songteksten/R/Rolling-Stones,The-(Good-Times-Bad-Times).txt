Titel:            GOOD TIMES BAD TIMES

Interpret:        ROLLING STONES



Thre've been good times, there've been bad times
I've had my share of hard times too.
But I lost my faith in the world
Honey when I lost you.
Remember the good times we had together.
Don't you want them back again.

Tho' these hard times are bugging me now.
I know it's the same.
There's gotta be trust in his world.
Or it won't get very far.
Well trusting someone.
Or just gonna beware
