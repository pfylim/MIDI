Singer : THE REAL THING 
Title  : CAN YOU FEEL THE FORCE

(Words & music: Chris Amoo/Eddie Amoo)

Chorus:
Can you feel the force, force, force, force?
Can you feel the force, force, force, force?
Can you feel the force, force, force, force?

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Can you feel the force?
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Can you feel the force?

There's a mood spreading 'round the world today
Can you feel the force
It's with you in you work
Or at your play
Can you feel the force

They're cleaning up the streets
Throughout the world
Can you feel the force
Ghetto folk have had the plight unfurled
Can you feel the force

You can feel the pressure lifting off your head
People who make war are making love instead
This could be the dawning of another time
Hatred is the stranger, we can see the sign

Chorus: ...

All you people with your heads on the ground
Can you feel the force
I can feel the hope spreading all around
Can you feel the force

I can feel a new beginning in the air
Can you feel the force
Peace and love glowing everywhere
Can you feel the force

You can see a change in people's attitude
Looking to their future in much brighter moods
There's a message clearly written in the sky
Times are changing, soon we'll be flyin' high

Chorus: ...
