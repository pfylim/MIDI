                Gigolo       David Lee Roth

         
         I'm just a Gigolo and every where I go
         People knows about I'm playing
         Paper every dance selling each romance
         Uh what they saying 
      
         There were comody when you smoke as the way
         what want they say about me
         when the end comes I'd know
         There was just a Gigolo
         Life goes on with out me
      
         Cause I ain't got nobody
         Nobody kiss for me
         Nobody nobody kiss for me
        
         I'm so sad and lonly
         Home walk some sweet mama
         Come and take a chance with me 
         To dieing so bad
