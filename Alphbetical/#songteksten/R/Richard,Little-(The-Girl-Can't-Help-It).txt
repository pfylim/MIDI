Title  : THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT

(Words & music: Bobby Troup)

If she get by and the menfolks get engrossed
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she winks an eye and bread slices turn to toast
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she's got a lot of what they call the most
She can't help it, the girl can't help it

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if she's got a figure made to squeeze
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it

If she mesmerizes every mother's son
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she smiles and rare steaks become well done
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
If she makes grandpa feel like twenty one
She can't help it, the girl can't help it

The girl can't help it if she was born to please
And if I go to her on bended knees
Won't you kindly be aware
The girl can't help it

Because I'm hoping obviously
That someday the answer will be
The girl can't help it
If she's in love with me
She can't help it, the girl can't help it
