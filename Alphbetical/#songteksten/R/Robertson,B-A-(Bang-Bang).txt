Title  : BANG BANG

(Words & music: Terry Britten/Brian Robertson)

The straight jacket of true luv's fire
Bang, bang
If you're Houdini in your spare time
Bang, bang
Lord Nel and Lady Hamilton
They fought for love
When he came home from the war
He gave her what for love
The mighty fall when love has called
Bang, bang

Vampire friends desire to lust
Bang, bang
They fall on necks then fall in love
Pang, pang
The marquis de Sade was happy with a stroke of love
Sherlock Holmes alone preferred a little toke of love

Chorus:
Bang, bang
The mighty fall (ho ho ho ho ho)
Bang, bang
When love has calld (ho ho ho ho)
Bang, bang
The mighty fall (ho ho ho ho ho)
Bang, bang

Tony and Cleo struck out for the free-o
Down Egypt's way
But Ceasar had squeezed her in Rome
On his quilt for a day, hey, hey

Now Anthony got really angry
About old Ceasar's hanky pankies
She told them she would use them
And boy, did he abuse them
Fallen love has blew 'em away

Chorus: ...

Na na na na na na na na na
And Sam and Delilah
They both we should file under fool
'Cos when the temple start to crumble
Sammy for his comb did frumble
Life was in a ruin
She love Johnny Fruin
Fallen love had blew 'em away

Bang, bang
When love has called (ho ho ho ho ho)
Bang, bang 
The mighty fall (ho ho ho ho ho)
Bang, bang 
When love has called (ho ho ho ho ho)
Bang bang

Bang, bang
Bang, bang
Bang, bang
