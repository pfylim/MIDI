COCK ROBIN - THE PROMISE YOU MADE

If I laid down my love
To come to your defense
Would you worry for me
With a pain in your chest
Could it rely on your faith to be strong
To pick me back up and to push me along

You'll be there in my hour of need
You won't turn me away
Help me out of the life I lead

REFRAIN:
Remember the promise you made?
Remember the promise you made?

If I gave you my soul
For a piece of your mind
Would you carry me with you
To the far edge of time
Could you understand if you found me untrue
Would we become one, or divided in two
Please tell me

REFRAIN: ...

Could it rely on your faith to be strong
To pick me back up and to push me along
Please tell me

REFRAIN: ...
