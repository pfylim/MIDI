Title  : DANCE AWAY

(Words & music: Bryan Ferry)

Yesterday,  well it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight
I said, it's love, you said, alright
It's funny how I could never cry
Until tonight and you pass by
Hand in hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying?

Chorus:
Dance away the heartache, dance away the tears
Dance away the heartache, dance away the tears
Dance away

Loneliness is a crowded room
Full of open hearts turned to stone
All together, all alone
All at once my whole world had changed
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Let the strobe light up them all
I close my eyes and dance till dawn

Chorus: ...

Now I know I must walk the line
Until I find an open door
Off the street on to the floor
There was I, many times a fool
I hope and pray, but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough

Chorus: ...
