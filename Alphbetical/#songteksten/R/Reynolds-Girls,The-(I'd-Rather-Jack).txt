THE REYNOLDS GIRLS - I'D RATHER JACK

I'd rather jack (jack)
I'd rather jack (jack)

All we wanna do is have a good time
Then you went and took our house away
No one ever asked for our opinion
No no we don't get a say

AM FM all that jazz
We'd rather sing along with Yazz
What happened to the radio
They never play the songs we know

refrain:
Golden Oldies, Rolling Stones
We don't want them back
I'd rather jack (jack)
Than Fleetwood Mac
No heavy metal rock'n'roll
Music from the past

I'd rather jack (jack)
Than Fleetwood Mac

I'd rather jack (jack)

Can't they see that every generation
Has music for its own identity
But why the DJ on the radio station
Is always more than twice the age of me

Who needs Pink Floyd Dire Straits
That's not our music it's out of date
Demographic stereo
They never play the songs we know
