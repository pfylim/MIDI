Singer : THE RUTTLES 
Title  : I MUST BE IN LOVE

(Word & music: Neil Innes)

I feel good, I feel bad
I feel happy, I feel sad
Am I in love?
Ah, ah, I must be in love

I feel sick, I feel poor
I'm in doubt, I feel sure
Am I in love?
Ah, ah, I must be in love

Any time of the day I can see
No face when I close my eyes, ooh
She's a dream she's real
Can't explain how I feel
Am I in love?
Ah, ah, I must be in love

I feel good, I feel bad
I feel happy, I feel sad
Am I in love?
Ah, ah, I must be in love (4x)
