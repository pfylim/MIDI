Baby baby I've been so sad since you've been gone
wayback to New York city where you do belong Honey
I missed your Two toned kisses the legs wrapped around
me tight.
If I ever get back to fun city girl I'm gonna make you scream
all night.

Honey, honey call me on the telephone
I know you are moving out to Hollywood with your can of tasty foam
All those beat up friends of mine
Got to get them in my book
And lead guitars and movie stars, get their toes beneath my hook
Yeah you were starbucker, starbucker star
starbucker, starbucker star
starbucker, starbucker star.

Yes I heard about your polaroids now that's what I call obscene
Your tricks with fruit were kinda cute
Now that really is a scene
Honey I miss your two toned kisses. legs wrapped around me tight
If ever I get back to New York
I'm gonna make you scream all night
Yeah starbucker, starbucker star
starbucker, starbucker star
starbucker, starbucker star

At the draw I got mad at you for giving it to Steve McQueen
And you and me made a pretty pair falling through the silver screen
Now baby I am open to anything I don't know where to draw the line
Well I am making bets that you gonna get your man before he dies
You were starbucker, stabucker, starbucker star
were starbucker, starbucker, starbucker star
were starbucker, starbucker, starbucker star
were starbucker, starbucker, starbucker star
