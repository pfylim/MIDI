If Ya can start me up
If Ya can start me up
I'll never stop
Ya can start me up
Ya can start me up
I'll never stop
never stop, never stop
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry

Brown sugar, how can you taste so good
Brown sugar, just like a young girl should....ahuwhoh

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the drivin' rain
But it's all right now
In fact it's a gas! But It's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, It's a gas, gas, gas!!

Under my thumb, 
Girl who once had me down
Under my thumb
Girl who once pushed me around
 down to me, yes it is, the difference
in the clothes she wears, down to me, the change has come under my thumb

It's a Honky Tonk Woman
Gimme gimme gimme the Honky Tonk Blues

Baby baby baby you're out of time
Baby baby baby you're out of time
you're left out, you're left out of there without a doubt

She comes in colors everywhere, she combs her hair
She's like a rainbow, 
comin' colors in the air, oh everywhere
she comes in colors...

Angie, Oh Angie
When will those dark clouds all disappear
Angie, oh Angie,
Where will it lead us from here.
