  9. SAY YOU SAY ME - LIONEL RICHIE
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT FOR ALWAYS
  THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT TOGETHER NAT'RALLY
  
  I HAD A DREAM
  I HAD AN AWESOME DREAM
  
  PEOPLE IN THE PARK
  PLAYIN' GAMES IN THE DARK
  
  AND WHAT THEY PLAYED WAS A MASQUERADE
  FROM BEHIND THE WALLS OF DOUBT
  A VOICE WAS CRYING OUT
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT FOR ALWAYS
  THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT TOGETHER NAT'RALLY
  
  AS WE GO DOWN
  LIFE'S LONESOME HIGHWAY
  SEEMS THE HARDEST THING TO DO
  IS TO FIND A FRIEND OR TWO
  
  THAT HELPING HAND
  SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
  
  AND WHEN YOU FEEL YOU'VE LOST YOUR WAY
  YOU'VE GOT SOMEONE THERE TO SAY
  I'LL SHOW YOU
  OOH OOH
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT FOR ALWAYS
  AH, THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT TOGETHER NAT'RALLY
  
  SO YOU THINK YOU KNOW THE ANSWERS
  OH NO
  WELL, THE WHOLE WORLD'S GOT YA DANCING
  THAT'S RIGHT I'M TELLIN' YOU
  
  IT'S TIME TO START BELIEVIN'
  OH YES
  BELIEVE IN WHO YOU ARE
  YOU ARE A SHINING STAR
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT FOR ALWAYS
  AH, THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE
  
  SAY YOU, SAY ME
  SAY IT TOGETHER NAT'RALLY
  SAY IT TOGETHER NAT'RALLY
