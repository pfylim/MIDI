Singer : ROCKAWAY BOULEVARD 
Title  : BOOGIE MAN

(Words & music: A. Mathijssen/Omar Dupree)

Gonna find me some sweet guy
To dance with me tonight
We gonna dance with feeling
'Cause I feel the time is right
Then I'll try to get you to be my boogie man
Boogie with me
All you can
Sittin' in some lonely room
With no one but me at home
Got to find me a boogie man
So I won't be all alone

When the music hits me now
I feel it down to my feet
I'm gonna be your boogie man
And make your nights complete

Gonna get down baby
Dancin' to the D.J.
If you don't feel like moving
Then get on out the way

When the music hits me
I feel it in my soul
I want you to be my boogie man
A boogie man with soul

Refrain:
Better watch out for the
Boogie man gonna get you
