Singer : THE ROLLING STONES 
Title  : DANCING WITH MR.D

Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst
The air smells sweet
The air smells thick
He never smiles his mouth merely twists the
breath in my lungs
Feels clinging and thick
Now I know his name, he's called mr. D.
and one of these days
He's gonna set you free
Human skulls is hanging right around his neck
The palms of my hand feel clammy and wet
I was dancing dancing dancing so free
I was dancing dancing dancing so free
Dancing Lord take your hands off me
Dancing with mr. D.

Will it be poison in my glass
Will it be slow or will it be fast
The bite of a snake the sting of a spider
A drink of belladonna of a toussaint night
Hiding round a corner in New York City
Looking down a 44 in West Virginia
I was dancing dancing dancing so free
I was dancing dancing dancing so free
Dancing Lord take your hands off me
Dancing with mr. D.

One night I was dancing with a lady in black
Wearing black silk gloves and a black silk hat
She looked at me longing with black velvet eyes
She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise
Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones
The eyes in her skull were just burning like coals

Lord have mercy fire and brimstone

I was dancing with mr. D.
Dancing dancing dancing so free
I was dancing dancing dancing so free
Dancing Lord take your hands off me
Dancing with mr. D.
