Singer : DEMIS ROUSSOS 
Title  : PERDONAME

Now the time has come to say goodbye
But I don't want to see you start to cry
Now at last comes the end of the game
We knew we'd have to face it

Close your eyes and let me go away
And believe me I really tried to stay
There's no reason and no one's to blame
Somehow we'll have to take it

Refrain:
Perdoname
If I hurt you I'm sorry
I'm just a stranger who came from nowhere
One rainy day
Perdoname
If I hurt you I'm sorry
You'll find a new love and you'll discover
A bright new day

Now the time has come to say goodbye
But I don't want to see you start to cry
Now at last comes the end of the game
We knew we'd have to face it

Refrain: ...(2x)...
