                   BACHELOR        BOY 

            
            When I was young my father said
            Son I have something to say
            And what he told me I'll never forget
            until my dyin day

            HE SAID SON YOU ARE A BACHELOR BOY
            AND THAT'S THE WAY TO STAY
            SON YOU BE A BACHELOR BOY
            UNTIL YOUR DYIN DAY

            When I was sixteen I fell in love
            with a girl as sweet as can be
            But I remembered just in  time what-my daddy said to me

            REFREIN

            As time goes by I probably will
            meet a girl and fall in love
            Then I'll get married have a wife and a child
            and they'll be my turtle doves

            BUT UNTIL THEN I'LL BE A BACHELOR BOY
            AND THAT'S THE WAY I'LL STAY
            HAPPY TO BE A BACHELOR BOY UNTIL MY DYIN DAY

            HERHAAL REFREIN
