Vers 1:
------------------------------------------------------------
My love
until you came into my life oneday my love 
you gave me more than ever I can say.
And then, I felt something went wrong.
Oh how I needed you, when you went away.
Good times that we used to have are just dreams of today.
------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------------
I could see,
how you tried to forget me,
I couldn't feel,
you were trying to leave me,
hangin' on, to a dream won't release me.
------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
------------------------------------------------------------
Please don't try to live behind a smiling face,
My love.
You know somehow I can't believe we're through my love
someday you know you're gonna make me blue.
I know there'll be no more goodbyes.
Oh how it hurts me so to let,
to let you go.
For a while I dreamed of love that could last this I know.
------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------------
I could see...
------------------------------------------------------------

Try to love and try to live in my sweet embrace. 
Uh
Ah
