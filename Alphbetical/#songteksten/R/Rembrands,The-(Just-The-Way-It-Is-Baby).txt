         Just The Way It Is, Baby         The Rembrands


Do you remember once upon a time, when you were mine ?
The stars above were bright and new, I pulled them down for you.
Just when I fell in love again, you said that all good things must end !

Refrain

Baby, that's just the way it is, baby, oh, oh,
Baby, that's just the way it is, baby.

I've never had a hand for solitaire, it's so unfair,
That I should have my chance and loose, I feel like I've been 
Used to help you trough another night, you've spelled it out in black and white
The tides that once had carried you away, bring you back today.
Now time has washed away my pain, you'll find that things have changed
And disappeard without a trace, you can't get back what you've erased.          

Refrain

And I say...
