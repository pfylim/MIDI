Singer : VICKEY SUE ROBINSON 
Title  : TURN THE BEAT AROUND

(Words & music: Gerald Jackson/Peter Jackson)

Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion 
Love to hear it

Blow horns, you sure sound pretty
Violins keep moving to the nitty gritty
But when you hear the scratch of the guitar scratching
Then you'll know that rhythm carries all the action

Turn the beat around, love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion
Love to hear it

Flute player do it so sweet
'Cause I know you want to get your thing off
But, you see, I've made up my mind about it
To me it is the rhythm no doubt about it

'Cause turn the beat around, love to hear percussion
Turn it upside down, love to hear percussion
Love to hear it
