ROCKWELL - SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME

I'm just an average man
With an average life
I work from 9 to 5
Hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone
In my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?

REFRAIN 1:
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call on me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
Can the people on tv see me, or I am just a paranoid?
When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find
someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of psycho too much, that's why

REFRAIN 2:
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me

(Who's watching me)
I don't know anymore
Are they neighbors watching me?
Well, is the mailman watching me?
And I don't feel safe anymore
Oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
(Who?)
The I.R.S.?
