Chantilly Lace and a pretty face and a pony tail
hangin' down, a wiggle in her walk and a giggle in her talk,
they're gonna make the wold go 'round.
Ain't nothing in the world like a big eyed girl to make me act
so funny, spend my doggone money, I feel real loose like a long
necked goose, like a wa, baby that's what I like !

Huh ? Ha ha ha.
Will I what ?
Do I what ?
Will I what ?
Can't never tell baby ?
Ha ha ha ha  I might,
but honey you know what I like.

Huh ? Ha ha ha.
Huh ? What's that ?
Pick you up at eight ?
And don't be late ?
You gotta be jokin' woman, I thought you might
pick me up at eight and don't be late.
It don't make no difference baby, 
you know what I really like.
What I like !

Woo ha ha ha ha ha  honey, you're tearin' me up on this telephone.
I swear I don't know what I'm gonna do with you, you yap and yap
and yap and yap and yap but when you break it all down you know
what I like.
