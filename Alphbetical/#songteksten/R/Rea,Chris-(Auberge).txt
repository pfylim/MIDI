AUBERGE - CHRIS REA


On the hard fast train   On the road to garn
Something gets right   Through to your telling bone
There's a sudden itch  An electric  Twitch
Sometimes I swear  This body's
Got a mind of it's own  This iws the naked truth
This is the light  There's only one place
Left to go

Auberge

You meet  A silent type  On a windy trail
With a shiny cloak  And an unseen silver dagger
You can talk till you ache  Give yourself one more break
You can tell by the look  On his face
That it just doesn't matter  This is the naked truth
This is the light  There's only one place
Left to go

Auberge

Give me a weekend  Give me a day
Don't like what I'm seeing  Though I hear what you say
Think with a dagger  And you'll die on your knees
Begging for mercy  Singing please mister please
This is the naked truth  This is the light
There's only one place
Left to go
