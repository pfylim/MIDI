Title  : I'M COMING OUT
Artist : DIANA ROSS

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

Chorus:
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show
I'm coming out
I want the world to know
Got to let it show

There's a new me coming out
And I just have to live
And I wanna give
I'm completely positive
I think, this time around
I am gonna do it like you never knew it
Oh, I'll make it through
The time has come for me to break out of the shell
I have to shout that I am coming out

Chorus: ...

Got to show the world
All that I wanna be
And all my abilities
There's so much more to me
Somehow, I'll have to make them just understand
I got it well in hand
And oh, how I've planned
I'm spreadin' love
There is no need for fear
And I just feel so good ev'ry time I hear

Chorus: ...
