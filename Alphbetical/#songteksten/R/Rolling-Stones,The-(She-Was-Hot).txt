ROLLING STONES - SHE WAS HOT

New York is cold and damp
TV is just blank
Looks like another dead end sunday

Think about an early night
Monday never feels so right
Ooo, the sheets feel cold and lonely

Who wants to brave the pouring rain
For a glass of French champagne?
Well grab a cab, grab a cab and come right by

And she was hot, as she kissed my mouth
She was hot as wiped her brow
She was hot she pinned me to the ground
She was quick she knew her away around
She was hot as she tore my clothes
She was hot she had no place to go
She was hot on a cold and rainy night

Detroit was smoky grey
Nothing like the good old days
I got a fever that I'm fighting
I don't need your company
Leave me in my misery
I can take the rebound
Just like lighting

And she was hot in a 50's dress
She was hot her lips were flashing red
I was lost in her burning flesh
I was hot I was dripping sweat
She was hot in the Detroit snow
She was hot on a cold and rainy night

And she was hot and I had the blues
She was hot honey where were you?
If you were in my shoes
You would be excused
She was hot you can never wait
She was hot never hesitate
She was hot on a cold and rainy night

I think I'm going off the rails
Riding down the pleasure trails

So take your passion where you find it
Honey when you were young and fresh
Go take the treasure where you find it

And she was hot in the melted snow
She was hot in the molten glow
She was hot she got it in the blood
She was hot like the dam that's burst
She was strong she was strong and true
She was black and her eyes were blue
She was lost and she took the chance
At just a brief romance
Down at the avenue into the lost bayou
Into the bamboo-back to the human zoo
I wish you all the best I hope we meet again
On a cold Chicago night

She was hot (4x)
She was hot hot hot (3x)
