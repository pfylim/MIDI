
8. WHAT I DID FOR LOVE - KENNY ROGERS

Everybody‹s heart is torn in two,
Mine was not designed for giving up.
‹Cause all I‹ve ever done that really matters,
Was what I did for love.

So, count me with the wounded and the shaken.
Even when I‹m barely standing up.
I‹ve tried to offer more than I had taken.
‹S what I did for love.

Chorus:
What I did for love.
What I did for love.  
And I hope that you can see,
All that love has done for me.

And when they sit and list the reason I existed,
I‹m afraid it won‹t add up to very much.
‹Cause I gathered all I had and gladly risked it,
That‹s what I did for love.

Chorus (2 times)

Some day I may silently surrender.
This old heart has finally had enough.
But I hope that I will always be remembered,
For what I did for love.
