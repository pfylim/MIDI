
4. DAYTIME FRIENDS - KENNY ROGERS

And he'll tell her
He's waiting late again
But she knows too well
There's something going on
She's been neglected
And she needs a friend
So her trembling finger 
Dials the telephone.

Lord, it hurts her
Doing this again
He's the best friend
That her husband ever knew
When she's lonely
He's more than just a friend
He's the one she longs
To give her body to.

Daytime friends
And night-time lovers 
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go
Or what they do
In their secret hideaway.

Oh daytime friends 
And night-time lovers
They don't want to hurt the other
So they love in the night-time
And shake hands in the light of day.

And when it's over
There's no peace of mind
Just a longing for
The way things should have been
And she wonders
Why some men never find
That a woman needs a lover and a friend.

Daytime friends
And night-time lovers 
Hoping no one else discovers
Where they go
Or what they do
In their secret hideaway.

Oh daytime friends 
And night-time lovers
They don't want to hurt the other
So they love in the night-time
And shake hands in the light of day.
