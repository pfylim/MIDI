Singer : RAINBOW TRAIN 
Title  : ANOTHER BAND

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Which one is the world we live in
Is it yours or is it mine
I don't mean to seek a problem
But I think it's about time
That we should start to think things over now
Before we find out it's too late
For all of us to start all over
'Cause we can't  go back to where it all began
We'll be all too old to start another band

Now tell me what holds us together
And what's keeping us apart
Was this meant to be forever
Was it lost right from the start
We should start to think things over
Before we find out it's too late
For all of us to start all over
'Cause we can't go back to where it all began
We'll be all too old to start another band

I don't see what the problem is
There's a lot of talks I must have missed
And I'm afraid they came from all around
And around and it seems that
No one ever tells me what is going on

I ... you say, 'bout your ...?
'Bout him, he's mad
Y'all been suckin' on the same lemon?
