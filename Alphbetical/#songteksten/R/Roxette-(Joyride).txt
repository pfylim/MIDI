Title  : Joyride
Singer : Roxette


I hit the road out of nowhere
I had to jump in my car
And be a rider in a love game
Following the starts
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train going downtown
She's get a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
Oh she's got me heart on the funfair
She's got me whistling her private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend
She says: hello you fool
I love you, C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride
She's al flower, I can paint her
She's a child of sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, oh no
Cos it all begins where it ends
And we're all magic friends
She says: hello you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride, hello you fool
I love you, C'mon join the joyride
Be a joyrider
I take you on a skyride
A feeling like you're spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rox you like a baby
