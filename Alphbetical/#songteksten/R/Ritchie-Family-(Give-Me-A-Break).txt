Artist : THE RITCHIE FAMILY

(Words & music: H. Belolo/V.L. Brown/E. Draher/Smith Lee)

I'm traveling through this game called life
It's a tough game to play
Sometimes the playing gets rough
Now that I've got the final okay
You're trying so hard to take it all away

Chorus:
I've got my education
I've got my determination
I've got imagination
Come on, give me a break
(...2x...)

Well I started out my life
Try to find a better way
To live in this world from day to day
Now people don't you know
Don't you know
Folk always say
You gotta reap just what you saw

Chorus: ...

Come on, give me a break (give it up)
Won't you give me a break?
Come on, give me a break (give it up)
I've just got a bit of shake
Come on, give me a break (give it up)
Oh, won't you give me, give me a break?
Come on, give me a break

I'm a woman
I've got a bit of shake
What you don't get, I will take

So I tried to find out what this was all about
Everyone wanted to go to their own way
You say I've got the right
No one can stop me now
I'm trying so hard and now I'll tell you how

Chorus: ...

Now I've don what I've been told
I have set all of my goals
And I believe deep down in my soul
I got a future, I've got a degree
I got everything but a J.O.B.

Chorus: ...
