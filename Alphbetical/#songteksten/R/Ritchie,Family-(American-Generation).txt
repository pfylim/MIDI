Title  : AMERICAN GENERATION

(Words & music: H. Belolo/J. Morali)

Chorus:
Ah, generation
Ah, generation
American generation
American generation

Founded on a beat, there's disco in the street
We boogie as we go, to funky radio
Finding summer fun, that's rooted in the drum
Let ev'rybody come

Chorus: ...

Grooving to the bass, it shows on every face
That life's a festival, so try some letting go
The future bears a change, there's music in our veins
We'll never be the same, oh oh oh

Chorus: ...
