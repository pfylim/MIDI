                  Silverbird
 

Long before I came to New York City,
I have left my man in St. Anton.
Heaven knows that life can be pity,
without the man of mine the sun ain't gonna shine.

Silverbird, Silverbird, Silverbird, keep on flying,
Sliverbird, Silverbird, Silverbird, my heart's sighing.
Silverbird, Silverbird, Silverbird, oh he's waiting,
he'll wait for me till I come back home,
long time he was alone.

Deep inside I feel the good vibrations,
I can smell the green, green gras of home.
I can't wait no more, I've lost my patience,
oh heaven can you see, what's going on with me.

Silverbird, ........
