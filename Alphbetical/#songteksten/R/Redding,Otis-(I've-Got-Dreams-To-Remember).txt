 Honey I saw you there last night

 Another man's arms holding you tight

 Nobody knows what I feeled inside

 All I know,I walked away and cried


 I've got dreams,dreams to remember (Listen to me)

 I'VE GOT DREAMS (rough dreams)DREAMS TO REMEMBER

 I know you said he was just a friend

 But I saw you kiss him again and again

 These eyes of mine,they don't fool me

 Why did he hold you so tenderly


 I've got dreams,dreams to remember (Listen honey)

 I'VE GOT DREAMS (rough dreams)DREAMS TO REMEMBER
 
 I still want you to stay, I still love you anyway

 I don't want you to ever leave, girl, you just satisfy me
