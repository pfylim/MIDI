Vers 1:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you hear about the Midnight Rambler ?
Ev'rybody got to go.
Did you hear about the Midnight Rambler,
the one that shut the kitchen door ?
He don't give a hoot of warning
a wrapped up in a black cat cloak.
He don't go in the light of the morning,
he's split the time the clock 'rel crows.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A talking 'bout the Midnight Gambler,
the one you never seen before.
A talking 'bout the Midnight Gambler,
did you see him jump the garden wall ?
A sighing down the wind so sadly
a listen and you hear him moan.
Well I'm a talking 'bout the midnight gambler,
ev'rybody got to go.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 3:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A did you hear about the midnight rambler ?
Well honey, it's no rock and roll show.
Well I'm talking 'bout the midnight rambler, yeah, 
the one you never seen before.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 4:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Well you heard about the Boston---
it's not one of those.
Well, talking 'bout the midnight---
the one who closed the bedroom door.
I'm called the hit and run rape her in anger,
the knife sharpened tippy -toe.
Or just the shot'em dead brain bell jangler,
you know, the one you never seen before.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 5:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
padding down your marbell hall.
Well he's prowling like a proud black panther
you can say I told you so.
Well won't you listen for the midnight rambler
play it easy as you go.
I'm going to smash down all your plate glass windows
put a fist right thru' your steel plate door.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 6:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you hear about the midnight rambler ?
He'll leave his foot-prints up and down your hall.
A did you hear about the midnight gambler ?
A did you see me make my midnight call ?
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler,
I'll steal your mistress from under your nose.
Well, go easy with your cold fandango, I'll
stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts !
