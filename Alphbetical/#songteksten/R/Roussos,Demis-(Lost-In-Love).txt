Title  : LOST IN LOVE

(Words & music: Russel)

I realise that this part of love is thinest lies
That don't count much, that I'm not letting go
I believe that there's no much to believe in

A:
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Wish on a star and I show you a plan
I figured it out, what I needed from someone
to show me

You know you can't fool me,
I've been loving you too long
This far it's so so easy, you want to carry on
Want to carry on, want to carry on

B:
Lost in love, and I don't know much
'Cause I'm thinking of love and I feel out of touch
I'm back on my feet and needed to be what you want me

You know you can't fool me,
I've been loving you too long
Besides, it's so easy if you want to carry on

(B + A + B + A herhalen)

Lost in love, lost in love
Lost in love, lost in love
