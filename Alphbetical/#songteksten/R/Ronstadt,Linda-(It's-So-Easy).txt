Title  : IT'S SO EASY

(Words & music: Buddy Holly/Norman Petty)

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
People tell me love's for fools
Here I go breaking all the rules

It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Well, where you're concerned
My heart can learn

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Look into you heart and see
What your love book has set aside for me

It seems so easy
Yeah, so doggone easy
Oh, it seems so easy
Well, where you're concerned
My heart can learn

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
