                   SEE  YOU   WHEN   I   GET  THERE

  

  How you're doin' ? I hope you're fine

  Did your day take you through changes and mess up your mind

  I just call to say that I'm on my way

  
  Oh and I'll see you when I get there



  I hope you're in a good mood

  You know a man's home is a castle and I'm coming home to groom

  
  Oh and I'll see you when I get there

  I'LL SEE YOU YOU WHEN I GET THERE

  And you'll be READY for good lovin', you be READY for good lovin'

  Cause I worked hard all day and I'm comin home to be with the one I love


  Candle light, cold wine, soft music on the radio-oh

  And you got everything you need from the store

  Cause I'll be comin this evening and I don't wanna come out no more


   Oh and I'll see you when I get there

  I'LL SEE YOU YOU WHEN I GET THERE

  And you'll be READY for good lovin', YOU BE READY for good lovin'

  Cause I worked hard all day and I'm comin home to lay and relax my mind

  Oh I'll see you WHEN I GET THERE, I SEE YOU WHEN I GET THERE

  I SEE YOU WHEN I GET THERE

  solo  

  Oh and I'll see you when I get there  enz......
