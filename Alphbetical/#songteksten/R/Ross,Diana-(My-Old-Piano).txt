Title  : MY OLD PIANO
Artist : DIANA ROSS

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

Chorus:
Love is called my old piano
I have a ball, with my old piano

My baby entertains the real life of my parties
But still retains in all dignity
His international style excludes an air of royalty
His eight key smile is so pleasant to see

Chorus: ...

My old keyboard won't stand for a corner
He demands the middle of the room
Your heart dissolves
While he tips you so gracefully
'Til you're involved in a baby grand affair

Chorus: ...
