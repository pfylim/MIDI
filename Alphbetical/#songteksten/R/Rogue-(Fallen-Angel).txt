Singer : ROGUE 
Title  : FALLEN ANGEL

You're home again, I'm glad you kept the key
Been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me
But hush now, I know you're all cried out
It's all right, inside I've had no doubt about
Your love for me
I can see behind your tears
I'm certain of the way we feel
And given time the hurt will heal

I need you, I think I always will
From time to time, you play around but I love you still
You tried them all, at ev'rybody's beck and call
Maybe you'll resist them all
When I tell you how I missed you

Refrain:
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything
You can't help the things you do
There's something gotten hold of you
Fallen angel, you've got a demon in your soul
But later when the fever's gone
I'll be here where you belong

You're home again, so won't you close the door
Stay here with me, and we'll forget what's gone before
So hold me tight, our love is gonna make it right
Put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone by

Refrain: ...
