      The Power of love           Jennifer Rush 


The whispers in the morning 
Of lovers sleeping tight 
Are rolling by light thunder now 
As I look in your eyes 

I hold on to your body 
And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake

Refrain 

'Cause I'm your lady , and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me  I'll do all that I can .

Lost is how I'm feeling
Lying in your arms
When the world outside's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you .

Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away
But never wonder where I am 
'Cause I am always by your side .

Refrain

'Cause I'm your lady , and you are my man
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can .
We're heading for something , somewhere I've never been ,
Sometimes I am fighting , but I'm ready to learn
'bout the Power of love .

The sound of your heart beating ,
May it kling suddenly .
The feeling that I can't go wrong
Is lightyears away .

Refrain

'Cause I'm your lady ...
... we're heading for something ...


Oh the power of love , the power of love ,
Sometimes I am fighting but I'm ready to learn
'bout the Power of love .
