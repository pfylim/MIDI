  3. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS - CHARLIE RICH
  
  My baby makes me proud
  Lord, don't you make me proud
  She never makes a scene
  By hanging all over me in a crowd
  'Cause people like to talk
  Lord, don't they love to talk
  But when they turn out the light
  I know she'll be leaving with me.
  
  And when we get behind closed doors
  Then she let's her hair hang down
  And she makes me glad that I'm a man
  Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.
  
  My baby makes me smile
  Lord, don't she make me smile
  She's never far away
  Or too tired to say
  I want you
  She's always a lady
  Just like a lady should be
  But when they turn out the lights
  She's still a baby to me.
  
  'Cause when we get behind closed doors
  Then she let's her hair hang down
  And she makes me glad that I'm a man
  Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
  Behind closed doors.
