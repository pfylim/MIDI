HONKY TONK WOMEN - Rolling Stones

I met a gin-soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride.
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just seem to drink you off my mind.

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme me, gimme, gimme the onky tonk blues

I laid a divorcäe in NYC
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses,
'Cause I just seem to drink you off my mind.

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme me, gimme, gimme the onky tonk blues, All right!

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme me, gimme, gimme the onky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
Gimme me, gimme, gimme the onky tonk blues
