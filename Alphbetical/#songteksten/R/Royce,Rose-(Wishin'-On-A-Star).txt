Title  : WISHIN' ON A STAR

(Words & music: Billie Calvin)

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star
To follow what it means (2x)

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray it never comes
And I wish on all the lovin' we've ever done

I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishing on a star
And I wish on all the rainbows that I see

I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me

Just think of all the moments that we've spent
I just can't let you go from me
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
That in the game of love

I feel it's time we should make up baby
I think it's time we should get back together
And make the best of thing, oh baby
When we're together, whether or never

I'm wishing on a star .....

And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
And I wish on all the people we
And I'm hopin' on all the days to come and days to go
And I'm hopin' on days of lovin' you so
