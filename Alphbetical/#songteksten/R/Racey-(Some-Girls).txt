Some girls will - some girls won't
some girls need a lot of lovin' and some girls don't
I know I got the fever but I don't know why
some say they will and some girls lie.

So here I am in front of you
not really knowing what to do
my heart is feeling something new
nervously I turn away from you
I see those looks you're sendin' me
is this the way it's meant to be
it's something we should talk about
just give me time to work it out.

Some girls will - some girls won't,...

I find your company to be
something completely new to me
now that I know you socially
obviously I'll fall heavily
I've seen those looks you're sendin' me
this is the way it's meant to be
ther'es nothing left to talk about
oh how I wish you'd work it out.

Some girls will - some girls won't,...
