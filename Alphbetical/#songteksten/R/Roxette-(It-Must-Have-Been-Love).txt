             It must have been love         Roxette


It must have been love, but it's over now
Lay a whisper on my pillow, Leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely there's air of silence, In the bedroom and all around.
Touch me now - I close my eyes
And dream away

Refrain 

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make believing we're together That I sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water. Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard winter's day I dream away

Refrain 

It must have been love but it's over now.
It was all that I wanted now I'm living without.
It must have been love but it's over now.
It's where the water flows, It's where the wind blows.
