       Fading like a Flower      Roxette


In a time where the sun descends alone
I ran a long, lonf way from home,
To find a heart that's made of stone.

I will try, I just need a little time 
To get your face right out of my mind
To see the world through different eyes.

Every time I see yu, oh,
I try to hide away,but when we meet 
It seems I can't let you go.
Every time you leave the room I feel
I'm fading like a flower.

Fading like a rose, fading like a storm,
Talking to myself, getting washed by the rain,
It's such a cold, cold town, 
Such a cold town

Tell me why when I scream there's no reply
When I reach out there's nothing to find,
When I sleep I break down and cry.

Every time I see you, oh, I try to hide away,
But when we meet, it seems I can't let you go.
Every time you leave the room I feel I'm
Fading like a flower.
