     Lucky Lips        Cliff Richard


Doe doep doe doe doe, doe doep doe doe doe
Doe doep doe doe doe, oh oh oh oh
Doe doep doe doe doe, doe doep doe doe doe
Doe doep doe doe doe, oh oh oh oh

When I was just a little baby,
I didn't have many toys.
But my mama used to say son
You got more that other boys.
Now you may not be good looking,
And you may not be too rich,
But you never ever be alone,
'Cause you got lucky lips.

Refrain
  
Lucky lips are always kissing,
Lucky lips are never blue,
Lucky lips will always find a
Pair of lips so true.
Don't need a follage clover,
Ruthers put our good luck charme,
With lucky lips you'll always have
A baby in your arms.

Now I never get heart broken,
No I never get the blues,
And if I play that game of love,
I know I just can't loose.
When they spin that wheel of fortune,
All I do is kiss my chips,
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah,
'Cause I got lucky lips.

Refrain

Lucky lips are always kissing, ...

Doe doep doe doe doe, ...
