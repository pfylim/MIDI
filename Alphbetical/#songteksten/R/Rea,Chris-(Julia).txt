  7. JULIA (CHRIS REA)
  
  
  EYES SO BRIGHT
  SO BIG AND WIDE
  MAKE YOU FEEL SO STRANGE
  SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE
  IT'S THE FACE OF AN ANGEL
  SOUL OF THE DEVIL MAY CARE
  I'D LOVE TO KNOW
  WHAT GOES ON IN THERE
  SHE NEEDS YOUR LOVE
  SHE NEEDS IT EVERY DAY
  BUT SPEAK OF LOVE
  SEE HER LAUGH AND RUN AWAY
  
  JULIA, WHICH WAY WILL GO
  JULIA, I WANNA KNOW
  JULIA, ONLY THE MOON AND STARS
  JULIA, KNOW JUST WHERE YOU ARE
  JULIA
  
  SEE THE DANCE
  THAT NEEDS NO ALIBI
  YOU DON'T NEED TO DREAM
  WHEN YOU KNOW YOU CAN FLY
  BUT SPEAK OF LOVE
  SEE HER LAUGH AND RUN AWAY
  
  JULIA, WHICH WAY WILL GO
  JULIA, I WANNA KNOW
  JULIA, ONLY THE MOON AND THE STARS
  JULIA, KNOW JUST WHERE YOU ARE
  JULIA
