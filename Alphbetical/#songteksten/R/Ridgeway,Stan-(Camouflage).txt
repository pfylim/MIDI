STAN RIDGEWAY - CAMOUFLAGE

I was a PFC on a search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was in the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy moving in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate

And then a big marine a giant with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said wait
When he came in close behind me he said
Don't worry son I'm here
If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge
I said well thanks a lot
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said the boys just call me Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Well we fought all night and side by side we took
our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him
Just as if he wasn't there
And in the morning we both took a chance and ran
And it was near the river bank when the ambush came
on top of us
And I'd thought it was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came
buzzing through a bush
And that big marine he just swat it with his hand
Just like it was a fly

Whoa Camouflage things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage this was an awfully strange marine

And I knew there was something weird about him
'Cause when I turned around he was pulling a big palm tree
Right up out of the ground
And swatting those Charlies with it from here
to Kingdom Come

When he led me out of danger I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine
named Camouflage

When I said his name a soldier gulped and a
medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said you may be telling true boy but this
here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed
away last night
In fact he's been here all week long
But before he went he said 'semper fi' and
said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a barrage
So here take his dog tag son
I know he'd want you to have it now
And we both said a prayer for a big marine
named Camouflage

Whoa Camouflage things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage this was an awfully big marine
Whoa Camouflage things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa Camouflage this was an awfully big marine
Whoa whoa Camouflage
