Title  : LAY YOUR LOVE ON ME

(Words & music: Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman)

When I met you, you were seventeen
Not just another teenage queen
And then I look you everywhere you've been
In and out of love, then back again now

When I first saw you, baby I knew
Ooh, darling, it had to be you
You're the one who takes me higher
Ooh, baby, set my heart on fire

Chorus:
Come on, baby, lay your love on me
Ooh baby let your love go free now
Come on, baby, lay your love to me
Baby, baby, baby, got the love I need now

Now I've tasted your sweet lips
Now darling, I know what I miss
You gave me more than I could ever take
With ev'ry word and ev'ry move you make now

Chorus: ...

I can't believe that after all this time
I got ev'ry little thing I ever hoped to find
Whatever you got, I can't let up
It's you, baby, it's you that I love
