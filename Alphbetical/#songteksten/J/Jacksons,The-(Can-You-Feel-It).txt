Title  : CAN YOU FEEL IT
Artist : THE JACKSONS

(words & music: Michael Jackson/Jackie Jackson)

If you look around
The whole world is coming together now
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Feel it in the air, the wind is taking it everywhere
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
All the colors of the world should be
Loving eachother wholeheartedly
Yes it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brothers, when hate won't do
When we're all the same

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

Sing out loud
Because we want to make a crowd
Touch a hand and sing a sound so pure
Salvation rings

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

All the children of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes it's alright
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Take the news to the marching man
Who are killing their brothers, when death won't do
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside me is inside of you

Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?
Can you feel it, can you feel it, can you feel it?

Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
Every healthy smile is hunger and strife to another child
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
Can you feel it now, so sisters and brothers
Show we know how, now tell me
