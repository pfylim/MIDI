Mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
Not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

You know I'm just a fool
Who's willing to sit around and wait for you
Baby can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

Chorus:

Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you (4x)

My heart is saying 'Don't let go'
Hold out to the end and
That's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

Chorus: ...
