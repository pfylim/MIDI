JANET JACKSON - NASTY

Give me a beat

Sitting in the movie show think nasty thoughts
Better be a gentleman or you'll turn me off
That's right let me tell you

REFRAIN:
Nasty nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty nasty boys don't ever change
Oh you nasty boys

I don't like no nasty car I don't like nasty food
Ooh ooh yeah
The only nasty thing I like is a nasty groove
Will this one do
Uh huh I know I said

REFRAIN: ...

Nasty nasty boys give me a nasty groove
Oh you nasty boys
Nasty nasty boys
Let me see your nasty body move
Oh you nasty boys

I could learn to like this listen up
I'm not a prude (no) I just want some respect (that's right)
So close the door if you want me to respond (ooh yeah)
'Cause Privacy is my middle name
My last name is Control
No my first name ain't Baby it's Janet
Miss Jackson if you're nasty (nasty)

REFRAIN: ...

Nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys don't mean a thing to me
Nasty don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
I live this part

Hey who's that thinking nasty thoughts (nasty boys)
Who's that in that nasty car (nasty boys)
Who's that eating the nasty food (nasty boys)
Who's jamming to my nasty groove (nasty boys)
Ladies nasty boys don't mean a thing
Oh you nasty boys
