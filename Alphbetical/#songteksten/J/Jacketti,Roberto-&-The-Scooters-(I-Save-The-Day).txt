ROBERTO JACKETTI & THE SCOOTERS - I SAVE THE DAY

Refrain:
I save the day
I save tomorrow
So I can run away
I save the day
I save tomorrow
So I can run away

Everybody's quarreling oh, everybody's got to fight
If we stop this torture we will shake our hands
And we'll unite
Weapons in the East and weapons planted in the West
They can't stop us, walking out there at our best
Come on

Refrain: ...

Silly stories about the world that it's all ending soon
Don't you think that it's a waste believing this at noon
Tomorrow will be fine and so I print it in my mind, ooh
And you can do it you can do it, come on

Refrain: ...

Sometimes people say I'm mad
But if something nice happens
I put it in my head
So when something bad happens to me
I always can run away

Refrain: ...
