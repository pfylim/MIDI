Title  : THE HARDER THEY COME
Artist : JOE JACKSONBAND

(Words & music: Jimmy Cliff)

Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're bornd and when you die
You know they never seem to hear even your cry

Chorus:
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share, now what is mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all

And the oppressors are trying to track me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them, Lord, they know now what they've done

Chorus: ...

And I'll keep on fighting for the things I want
Although I know what when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

Chorus: ...2x...
