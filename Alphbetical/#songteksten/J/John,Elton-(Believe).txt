Elton John - Believe


I believe in love 
It's all we've got
Love has no boundaries
Costs nothing to touch
War makes money
Cancer sleps
Curled up in my father
And that means something to me
Churches and dictators
Politics and papers
Everything crumbles
Sooner or later
But love
I believe in love
It's all we've got
Love has no boundaries
No borders to cross
Love is simple
Hate breeds
Those who think difference
Is the child of disease
Father and son
Make love and guns
Families together
kill someone
Without love
Without love
I wouldn't believe
In everything that lives and breathes
Without love
I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe
In the right to stand here

Without love 
I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love
