Title  : SHE WAS DYNAMITE

(Words & music: J. de Nijs/J. Verburgt)

It was a cool, cool night 
And the moon was bright
She smiled at me and I felt alright
She was dynamite
That lady of the night

How she was standing there
With her long black hair
Waiting for the man she wanted to care
Till the mornin' light
That lady of the night

Well she was dynamite
That lady of the night
What she did, what she took
What she gave was heavenly
Well she was dynamite
She made me feel alright
I said holy smoke, I never thought
Such a dream could happen to me
