THE JACKSON FIVE - I WANT YOU BACK

(Words & music: The Corporation)

Oh wo-oh wo-oh wo-oh let me tell you now
Ooh ooh (ooh ooh)
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces
Always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glace was all it took
Now it's much too late for me 
To take a second look

Oh baby give me one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me (back in your heart)
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back) oh I do now
(I want you back, I want you back)
(I want you back, I want you back)
B-b-b-b all I want
B-b-b-b all I need
B-b-b-b all I want
(I want you back) oh I do now
(I want you back) ooh ooh baby
(I want you back) yeah yeah yeah yeah
(I want you back) now now n-now

Trying to live without your love
Is one long sleepless night
Let me show you girl
That I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on
I leave tearstains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't 
Even want around

Let me tell you now
Oh baby all I need os one more chance
(To show you that I love you)
Won't you please tell me (back in your heart)
Won't you please tell me (back in your heart)
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
But now when I see you in his arms ooh ooh
(Let you go baby)
B-b-b-b
B-b-b-b all I want
B-b-b-b all I need
B-b-b-b all I want
B-b-b-b all I need

(Oh just one more chance to show you that I love you)
(Baby) baby (baby) baby (baby) baby
(I want you back forget what happened then)
(I want you back a love we'll never keep)

Oh baby I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back spare me all this harm)
(I want you back a guilt like we're alone)
Oh baby I need one more chance
I tell you that I love you
(Baby) oh (baby) oh (baby) oh
I want you back (forget what happened then)
I want you back (a love we'll never keep)

ABC easy as one two three
Oh simple as ABC
Easy as one two three
Take it down, take it down
Take it down, take it down
ooh take it down, take it down baby

B-b-b-b all I want
B-b-b-b all I need
B-b-b-b all I want
B-b-b-b all I need
B-b-b-b all I want
