I remember when Rock was young,
we and Susie had so much fun,
holding hands and skimming stones,
had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own.
But the biggest kick I ever got,
was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock,
while the other kids were rocking round the clock,
we were hopping ind bopping to the Crocodile Rock.

Well Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking 
when your feet can't keep still.
I never knew me a better time 
and I guess I never will. Oh !
Lawdy Mama those Friday nights,
when Susie wore her dresses tight,
and the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of a sight.
La
la la la la   la
la la la la   la
la la la la la   la
But the years went by
and the Rock just died,
Susie went and left us for some foreign guy,
Long nights crying by the record machine,
dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans.
But they'll never kill the dreams we've got,
burning up the Crocodile Rock,
learning fast as the weeks went past,
We really thought that Crocodile Rock would last.

Well Crocodile Rockin' is something shocking 
when your feet can't keep still.
I never knew me a better time 
and I guess I never will. Oh !
Lawdy Mama those Friday nights,
when Susie wore her dresses tight,
and the Crocodile Rocking was-a out of a sight.
