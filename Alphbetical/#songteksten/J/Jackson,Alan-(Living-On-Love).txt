Two young people without a thing
say some vows and spread their wings
settle down with just what they need
Livin' on love

She don't care 'bout what's in style
she just likes the way he smiles
it takes more than marble and tile
Livin' on love

Livin' on love buyin' on time
without somebody nothin' ain't worth a dime
just like an old fashioned story book rhyme
Livin' on love
It sounds simple that's what you're thinkin'
but love can walk through fire without blinkin'
it doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love

Two old people without a thing
children gone but still they sing
side by side in that front porch swing
Livin' on love
he can't see anymore
she can barely sweep the floor
hand in hand they'll walk through that door
just livin' on love

(chorus)
No it doesn't take much when you get enough
Livin' on love
