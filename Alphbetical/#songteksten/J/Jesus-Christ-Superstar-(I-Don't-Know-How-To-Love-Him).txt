  5. I Don't Know How To Love Him - Jesus Christ Superstar
  
  I don't know how to love him
  What to say how to move him
  I've been changed yes really changed
  In these past few days when I've seen myself
  I seem like someone else.
  
  I don't know how to take this
  I don't see why he moves me
  He's a man he's just a man
  And I've had so many men before
  In very many ways
  He's just one more.
  
  Should I bring him down
  Should I scream and shout
  Should I speak of love
  Let my feelings out
  I never thought I'd come to this
  What's it all about?
  Don't you think it's rather funny
  I should be in this position
  I'm the one who's always been
  So calm so cool
  No lover's fool
  Running every show
  He scares me so.
  
  I never thought I'd come to this
  What's it all about?
  
  Yet if he said he loved me
  I'd be lost I'd be frightened
  I couldn't cope
  Just couldn't cope
  I'd turn my head, I'd back away
  I wouldn't want to know
  He scares me so
  I want him so
  I love him so.
