I just seen trouble
he's calling out your name tonite
Billy get your guns

You could walk away
but I know you were born to fight
so Billy get your guns

The bandileros are strung out
in the promenade
Billy get your guns

And the wind whispers softly
that the devil's to blame
Billy get your guns

Chorus:
Billy get your guns
there's trouble blowing like a hurricane
Billy get your guns
that's the price on your head for the
price of fame
and it'll never change
Billy get your guns

There's a whiskey bottle empty
sittin' on the bar
Billy get your guns
and some organ grinder singing
about some sucker moving on
Billy get your guns

All the whores are hanging out
waiting to get paid
Billy get your guns
from some Johnny on the spot
who said hey keep the change baby

Chorus:
Billy get your guns
there's trouble blowing like a hurricane
Billy get your guns
that's the price on your head for the
price of fame
and it'll never change
Billy get your guns

They christened you with whiskey
and there's fire running through your veins
well you're an outlaw just the same
and every night a bullet wears your name

Chorus:
I've seen a hangman dancing
beneath the pale moonlight
Billy get your guns

And every stranger that you meet
thinks it's his lucky night
Billy get your guns

I don't envy you, Billy
but I want to say
you better get your guns
'cause every outlaw that died
will live to ride again
Billy get your guns

Fire to fame
and it'll never change
Billy get your guns.
