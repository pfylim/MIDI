ELTON JOHN - HEARTACHE ALL OVER THE WORLD

(Words & music: Elton John/Bernie Taupin)

Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the window sill

And it's a wild friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache all over the world

Girls girls girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache all over the world

He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head

There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash it'll drive you crazy
Cos the cops invade your dreams

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache all over the world

Girls girls girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache, heartache all over the world

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache all over the world

Girls girls girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekends means
Heartache, heartache all over the world
