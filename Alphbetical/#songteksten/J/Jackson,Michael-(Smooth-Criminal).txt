MICHAEL JACKSON - SMOOTH CRIMINAL

(Words & music: Michael Jackson)

As he came into the window
It wasn't the sound of crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was stuck down, it was her doom

Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie
Annie are you ok?
So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie

(That he struck you, a crescendo Annie)
