Title  : Nikita
Singer : Elton John


Hey Nikita it is cold
In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

Chorus:
Oh Nikita you will never know
Anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels
To hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side
Of any given life in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no Nikita you'll never know

Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west
And find a friend

Chorus (first four rules)
Oh no Nikita you'll never know

Chorus
