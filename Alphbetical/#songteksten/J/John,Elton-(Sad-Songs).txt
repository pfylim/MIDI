Guess there are time when we all need to share a little pain
and ironing out the rough spots is the hardest part when the memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'cause from the lipsof some old singe we can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on turn on those sad songs when all hope is gone 
why don't you tune in and turn them on They reach into your room, 
oh just feel their gentle touch when all hope is gone
you know that sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough, oh, 
to write it down when ev'ry single word make sense 
then it's easier to have those songs around.
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you and 
it feels so good to hurt so bad and suffer just enough to sing the blues

Refrain

Sad songs they say, sad songs they say
Sad songs they say, sad songs they say so much

Refrain

When all hope is gone you know that sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone you know that sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone you know that sad songs say so much
