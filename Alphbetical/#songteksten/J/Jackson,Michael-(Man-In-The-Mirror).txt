MICHAEL JACKSON - MAN IN THE MIRROR

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need

A summer's disregard a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

refrain:
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na na na na na na na na na na

I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize 
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending
That they're not all alone

A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream (washed out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

refrain: ...2x...

I'm starting with the man in the mirror oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways (you'd better change)
And no message could have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make a change)
(You gotta get it right while you got the time)
('Cause when you close your heart)
You can't close your mind

That man, that man, that man, that man
That man, that man, that man, you know, that man

No message could have been any clearer
(If you wanna make the world a better place)
(Take a look at yourself and then make the change)
Na na na na na na na na na na
Gonna feel real good now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Na na na na na na na na na na
Oh no no no I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good come on (change)
Just lift yourself you know
You've got to stop it yourself
(Yeah make that change)
I've got to make that change today hoo
(Man in the mirror) you got to
You got to not let yourself brother hoo
(Yeah) you know (make that change)
