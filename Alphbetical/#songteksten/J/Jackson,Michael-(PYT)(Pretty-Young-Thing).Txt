Title  : P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)
Singer : Michael Jackson


Where did you come from lady
And ooh won't you take me there'
Right away won't you baby
Tenderoni you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar fly with me
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max

Chorus:
I wanna love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
(2x)

Anywhere you wanna go

Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free
Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right, in the night
Hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all I've got

chorus

Pretty young things, repeat after me
(Michael) I said na na na
(P.Y.T.'s) Na na na
etc.
(Michael) I wanna take you there
