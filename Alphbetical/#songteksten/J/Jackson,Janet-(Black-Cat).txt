Title  : Black Cat
Singer : Janet Jackson


All the lonely nights
I spend alone
Never 'round to love me
You're always gone
'Cause you're hanging out
Breaking the rules
Oh the man has come
Looking for you

You're a rebel now
Don't give a damn
Always carrying on
With the gang
I'm trying to tell you boy
It's a mistake
You won't realize
Till it's too late
Don't understand why you insist

On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know
That you're telling me lies

Black cat, nine lives
Short days, long nights
Livin' on the edge
Not afraid to die
Heart beat real strong
But not for long
Better watch your step
Or you're gonna die

You're so together boy
Just at a glance you'll do anything
If given a chance scheming planning lies
To get what you need
So full of promises

That you'll never keep
Don't tell yourself
That it's okay
Sick and tired of
All your games
And you want me to stay
Oh better change

Makes no sense to me your crazy ways
Black cat, black cat
Man, I don't understand your ways
You're gonna make me lose
