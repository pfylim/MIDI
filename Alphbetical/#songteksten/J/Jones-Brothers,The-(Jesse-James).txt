Jess James was a man who killed many a man,
he robbed the Glendale train,
he stole from the rich and he gave to the poor,
he'd a hand and a heart and a brain.
Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life, 
three children they were brave,
but the dirty little coward that shot Mister Howard
has laid Jesse James in his grave.

It was on a Wednesday night,
the moon was shining bright,
they robbed the Glendale train.
They people they did say
for many miles away,
it was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.

It was on a Sturday night,
Jesse was at home,
talking to his family brave,
Robert Ford came along
like a thief in the night
and laid poor Jesse in his grave.

The people held their breath,
when they heard of Jesse's death,
and wondered how he ever came to die.
It was one of his own gang,
called little robert ford,
he shot poor Jesse on the sly.
