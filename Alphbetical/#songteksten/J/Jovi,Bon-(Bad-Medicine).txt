BON JOVI - BAD MEDICINE

(Words & music: J. Bon Jovi/R. Smabora/D. Child)

Refrain:
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need woh oh oh
Shake it up just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can
Cure my disease

Bad medicine
I ain't got a fever
Got a permanent disease
And it'll take more than a shot
To get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms
Count 'em one two three

First you need
(That's what you get for)
(Falling in love)
Then you bleed
(You get a little but it's)
(Never enough)
And when you're on your knees
(That's what you get for)
(Falling in love)
Now this boy's addicted
'Cause your kiss is the drug woh oh oh

Refrain: ...

Bad bad medicine
I don't need no needle
To be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia
Or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction
It doesn't leave a track
I got a Jones for your affection
Like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic
Gonna save this heart attack

When you need
(That's what you get for)
(Falling in love)
Now this boy's addicted
'Cause your kiss is the drug woh oh oh

So let's play doctor baby
Cure my disease
Bad bad medicine that's what I want
Bad bad medicine woh it's what I need

I need a respirator
'Cause I'm running out of breath
Oh you're an all night generator
Wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine
You take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better
Baby well
They haven't found it yet woh oh oh

Refrain: ...2x...

Bad bad medicine it's what I want
Bad bad medicine who's bad, who's bad
I gotta I gotta I gotta do it again
Wait a minute wait a minute hold on
I'm not done one more time with feeling
C'mon alright help me out

Refrain: ...

You got the potion that can cure my disease
You love bad medicine your kiss is what I need
Your bad medicine
