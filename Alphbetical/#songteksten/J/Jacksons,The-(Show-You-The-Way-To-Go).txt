Title  : SHOW YOU THE WAY TO GO

(Words & music: Kenny Gamble/Leon Huff)

Ah let me show ya
Let me show you the way to go

I don't know everything
But there's something I do know
I know I know
I've read and heard enough
Ah, now we're ready to show
That we can come together an' think like one
Come together now
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please let me show ya

Chorus:
Let me show ya
Let me show you the way to go
Follow me, follow me
Let me show ya
Let me show you the way to go

Just put your trust in me
I'll try not to let you down
Letcha down letcha down
A good job is hard to do
But only we can't let us down
'Cause we can help we can do it now
Trust ev'rybody an' get the job done
Please, please, please just let me show ya

Chorus: ...

'Cause we can help each other to overcome
We can do it we can do it now
Live together underneath the sun
Please, please, please just let me show ya

Chorus: ...

I'll never letcha down
Never letcha down, I'll never let you down
Put your hand in mine
We can do it, we can do it
We can work it out, work it out
If you don't stop
Let me show ya
Let me show ya
Let me show ya

Chorus: ...
