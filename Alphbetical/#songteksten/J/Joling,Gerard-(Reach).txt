GERARD JOLING - REACH

Reach for another
Once in your life
You can win

We gotta reach
Reach for another
Once in your life
You can win

Every time a day goes by
And people feel so low
From the highest mountain to the deepest sea
We can't let this go on
(Well there's a feelin' 'round the world today)
(Everybody's down)
Now from San Francisco down to Tokyo
We can fight it all

We gotta reach
Reach for another
Once in your life
You can win

We can all communicate
So pass the world around
From the highest mountain to the deepest sea
We must work it out
For even in the darkest night,
Love it will unite
We can't let the love in this world die
(Everybody sing it)

We gotta reach
Reach for another
Once in your life
You can win

We gotta reach (4x)

We gotta reach
Reach for another
Once in your life
You can win
