ROBERTO JACKETTI & THE SCOOTERS - ONE DAY IS ENOUGH

Refrain:
One day's enough like this
I can't stand the air around me
One day's enough like this
I know it's now or never
I hope I will be clever
Clever enough to see

My engine didn't want to start
My friendship fell apart
Didn't have my lucky day
Although I'm tryin' everything
There's no time left
To swing and dream away

Refrain: ...

You spilt your coffee and you broke the dishes
And at your work they all seemed so suspicious
You burned the dinner and you gave up trying
Because you thought that everyone was lyin'

Sha na na na na na na na na na na na (4x)

Those days the things you try go wrong
You really don't feel strong
All you do is carry on
But one day will be the day
That you can smile and say, hello again

Refrain: ...
