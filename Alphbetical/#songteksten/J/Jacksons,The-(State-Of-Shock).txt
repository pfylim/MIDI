Title  : State Of Shock
Singer : The Jacksons


You gotta be mine, 'cause you're so fine
I like your style
It makes me wild
You take it to me good
You like? Know you should
You get me on my knees
Well, please, baby, please
Listen? She looks so great
Every time I see her face
She puts me in a state
A state of shock

Se put me on my knees
Please, baby, please
I know you like to tease
Please, baby, please
You take it to me good
You like it? Know you should
I love the way you walk
And talk, baby, talk
Listen? She looks great
Every time I see her face
She puts me in a state
A state of shock
