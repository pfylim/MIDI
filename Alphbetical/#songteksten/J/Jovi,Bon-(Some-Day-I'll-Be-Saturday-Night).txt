Titel: Some Day I'll Be Saturday Night    
Interpret: Bon Jovi

Hey, man I`m alive
I`m taking each day and night at a time
I`m feeling like a Monday 
But some day I`ll be Saturday night

Hey my name is Jim, where did I go wrong
My life`s a parking basement
All the good shit`s gone
Just can`t hold a job
Where do I belong?
But sleeping in my car
My dreams move on

My name is Billy G.
I love is bold and soul
I`m only sixteen
I feel a hundred years old
My Foster Daddy went, took my innocence away
The streetlife ain`t much better
But at least I`m getting paid

And Tuesday just might go my way
It can`t get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, fridays ain`t been kind
But somehow I survive

Hey, man I`m alive
I`m taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I`m down but I know I get by
Hey, hey, hey, hey man
I`m gonna live my life
Like I ain`t got nothing
But this road of a dice
But feeling like a monday 
But some day I`ll be Saturday night

I can`t see my name or tell you where I am
I wanna roll myself away 
Don`t know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone elses soul, someone elses face

Oh, Tuesday just might go my way
Can`t get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, fridays ain`t been kind
But somehow I survive

Hey, man I`m alive
I`m taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I`m down but I know I get by
Hey, hey, hey, hey man
I`m gonna live my life
I`m gonna pick up all the pieces
And what`s left of my price
But feeling like a Monday but
Some day I`ll be Saturday night

Saturday night

Some Day I`ll be Saturday night
I`ll be back on my feet
I`ll be doing all right
But man it`ll be tomorrow babe
That`s OK
I ain`t going down
I`m gonna find a way, hey, hey

Hey man I`m alive
I`m taking each day and night at a time
Yeah I`m down but I know I get by
Hey, hey, hey, hey man
I`m gonna live my life
Like I ain`t got nothing
But this road of a dice
I`m feeling like a Monday but
Some day I`ll be Saturday night
I`m feeling like a Monday but
Some day I`ll be Saturday night

Oh, oh, oh
Saturday night
All right, all right
Saturday night
