RICK JAMES - LOOSEY'S RAP

(Words & music: Rick James)

I know a chick her name is Loosey
She's a freaky thing
Her legs are long, her lips are juicy
You outta hear what friends have to say
About Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap
She don't scream and she don't holler
She don't make a sound
I have taught her like a scholar
She knows what to do
When my love comes down
I said Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

They call me Loosey 'cause I'm so loose
Make all the right moves when I seduce
Your mind, your body, your soul I will capture
Turn you out so good that you will have to
Loose control, become infatuated
For something exotic, erotic and x-rated
Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

Candy is sweet and fruits are juicy
But how would you like to get a taste of Lucy
I know a chick her name is Loosey
She's a freaky thing
Her legs are long, her lips are juicy
You outta hear what friends have to say
About Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

Now the way I act and the words
I speak make people think I'm super
Freak, well I am what I am and I do
What I do how would you like for me
To freak you
Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

They call me Loosey 'cause I'm so loose
Make all the right moves when I seduce
Your mind, your body, your soul I will capture
Turn you out so good that you will have to
Loose control, become infatuated
For something exotic, erotic and x-rated
Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

Now the way I act and the words
I speak make people think I'm super
Freak, well I am what I am and I do
What I do how would you like for me
To freak you
Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap

Loosey's rap, Loosey's rap
