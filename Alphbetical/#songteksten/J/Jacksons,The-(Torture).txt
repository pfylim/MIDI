THE JACKSONS - TORTURE

It was on a street so evil
So bad
That even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool
Who stumbled on it

Eyes within the dark were watchin'
I felt
The sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walkin'
Told me
I should not have gone there

Baby
But you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
I'm out I'm walkin' the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, so much torture

She was up a stair to nowhere
A room
Forever I'll remember
She said as though I should have known her
Tell me
What's your pain or pleasure

Every little thing you find here
Is simply
For the thrill you're after
Loneliness or heart on fire
I am here
To serve all masters

She said
Reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
Unmerciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, so much torture
It's torture

And I still can't find the meaning
Of the face that I keep seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel
Strike a flame
In me

Baby
'Cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
I'm out I'm walkin' the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, girl, it's torture
Without your love
It's torture
