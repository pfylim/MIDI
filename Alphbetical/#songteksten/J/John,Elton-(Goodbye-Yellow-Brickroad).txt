Singer : ELTON JOHN 
Title  : GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD

When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
Should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I am not a present for your friends
To open this boy's too young to
be singing the blues

What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down you plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka
and tonics to set you on your feet again
May be you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
I'm mongrels who ain't got a penny
Singing for tit-bits like you on the ground

Ah, ah
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your pent-house
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old howl in the woods
Hunting the homy back toad
Oh I've fin'lly decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road
