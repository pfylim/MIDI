Singer : JACK JERSEY 
Title  : DON'T BREAK THIS HEART

Don't break this heart, don't tell me it's over
Don't send me back to a place I hate to go
Don't let me hide just like I did before I met you
Don't let me down, don't break this heart in two

For I want you, I need you
Baby can't you see
I really really love you
Or could there be somebody else waitin' for you
Once you taught me how to love you
How to need you baby
Could you teach me how to forget
So don't let me down, don't break this heart in two
