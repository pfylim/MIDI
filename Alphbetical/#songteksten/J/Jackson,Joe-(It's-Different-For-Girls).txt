Title  : IT'S DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS

(Words & music: Joe Jackson)

What the hell is wrong with you tonight?
I can't seem to say or do the right thing
Wanted to be sure you're feeling right
Wanted to be sure we want the same thing

She says, I can't believe it
You can't, possibly mean it
Don't we, all want the same thing
Don't we
Well, who said anything about love?
No not love she said
Don't you know that it's different for girls?
You're all the same

Mama always told me save yourself
Take a little time and find the right girl
Then again don't end up on the shelf
Logical advice gets yo in a whirl

I know, a lot of things that
You don't you wanna hear some
She said, just give me something
Anything
Well give me all you got but not love
No not love she said
Don't you know that it's different for girls?
You're all the same
