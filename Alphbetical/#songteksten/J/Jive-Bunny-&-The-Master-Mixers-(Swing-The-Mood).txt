Dying all the time

And you ain't no friend of mine

Shake-shake-shake-shake rattle and roll
I said shake rattle and roll

Well the first time I was her what's wrong with me
I'm itching like a man on a forest tree
Raging mad and as wild as a bull
I'm in love I'm all shook up

W-w-warden threw a party in the country jail
The prison band was there they began to wail
The band was jumping and the staff began to swing
You should've heard them knocked up jail birds sing
Let's rock everybody let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the jailhouse rock

Woh-wah-wah-wah
Woh-wah-wah-wah
Woh-wah-wah-wah
At the hop hop hop-hop-hop

W-wop wop bop a loo bop

W-wop wop bop a loo bop
Lop bop bop
