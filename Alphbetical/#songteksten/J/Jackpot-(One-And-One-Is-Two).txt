Singer : JACKPOT 
Title  : ONE AND ONE IS TWO

Five four three two

Refrain:
One and one is two
You love me I love you
Two and two is four
Please open up the door
One and one is two
You love me I love you
Two and three is five
You're gonna be my wife

Listen to a very funny story
A teacher told me once when I was very young
Take your fingers of your hand and count them
It stops your tears and you will see the sun

Refrain: ...

So sing it one two three four five
And when it's six you'll be my wife
So take your left hand, your right hand
Your left hand, your right hand and love me do
Now sing seven eight nine ten
And now we start it once again
I take the left hand, the right hand,
Left hand, right hand from you

Refrain: ...

Now I'm old but I always remember
The teacher told me many years ago
I take my hand and look at every finger
It stops my tears and then I'm shouting
five four three two

Refrain: ...
