Title  : XANADU
Artist : OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN & E.L.O. 

(Words & music: Jeff Lynne)

A place where nobody dared to go
The love that we came to know
They call it Xanadu

And now open your eyes and see
What we have made is real
We are in Xanadu

A million lights are dancing and there you are
A shooting star, an everlasting world
And you're here with me eternally

Chorus:
Xanadu - Xanadu (Now we are here)
in Xanadu (2x)

Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you
Xanadu

The love, the echoes of long ago
You needed the world to know, they are in
Xanadu

The dream that came through a million years
That lived on through all the tears
It came to Xanadu

A million lights (enz.)

Chorus: ...

Now that I'm here
Now that you're near in Xanadu
