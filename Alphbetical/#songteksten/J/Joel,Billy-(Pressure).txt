You have to learn to pace yourself pressure
you're just like everybody else pressure
you've only had to run so far so good
but will come to a place where the only thing you feel
are loaded guns in your face
and you'll have to deal with pressure.

You used to call me paranoid pressure
but even you cannot avoid pressure
you turened the tap dance into your crusade
now here you are with your faith
and your Peter Pan advice
you have no scars on your face and you cannot handle pressure.

All grown up and no place to go
psych one psych two what do you know
all your life is Channel thirteen
Sesame Street what does it mean pressure .

Don't ask for help you're all alone pressure
you'll have to answer to your own pressure
I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale
but here you are in the ninth
two men out and three men on
nowhere to look but inside
where we all respond to pressure.

All grown up and no place to go
psych one psych two what do you know
all your life is Time Magazine
I read it too what does it mean pressure pressure

I'm sure you'll have some cosmic rationale
but here you are with your faith 
and your Peter Pan advice
you have no scars on your face
and you cannot handle pressure mm pressure pressure
one, two, tree, four pressure.
