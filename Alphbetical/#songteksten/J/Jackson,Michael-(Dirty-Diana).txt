MICHAEL JACKSON - DIRTY DIANA

(Words & music: Michael Jackson)

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
Just saying that's okay
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touched me so to start
She says there's no turning back
She trapped me in her heart

Refrain:
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana
Let me be

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at back stage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying that's okay
Hey baby so what you want
I'll be your night loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a start

Refrain: ...

She said I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me
I say my baby's at home
She's probably waiting tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright

Diana walked up to me
She said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Saying baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me
