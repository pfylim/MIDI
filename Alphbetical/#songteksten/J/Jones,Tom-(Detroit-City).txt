Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City
and I dreamed about the cottonfields back home.
Dreamed about my mother, dear old papa,
sister and brother 
and I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting far so long.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------
I wanna go home,
I wanna go home,
oh, how I wanna go home.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Home folks think I'm big in Detroit city,
from the letters that I write they think I'm fine.
But by day I make the cars by night I make the bars
if only they could read between the lines.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------
I wanna...
---------------------------------------------------------------
