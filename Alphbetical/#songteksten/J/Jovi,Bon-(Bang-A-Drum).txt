I went to see the preacher
to teach me how to pray
he looked at me and smiled
then that preacher turned away
he said if you want to tell him something
you ain't gotta fold your hands
say it with your heart
your soul and believe it
and I'd say amen

Bang a drum for the sinners
bang a drum for his sins
bang a drum for the losers
and those who win
bang a drum bang it loudly
or as soft as you need
bang a drum for yourself son
and a drum for me

I called upon my brother just the
other day, he said: John I'm gonna
die if I don't start to live again
I work each day and night like clockwork
just trying to make ends meet
I could kick this bad world's ass
if I could just get on my feet

I'd bang a drum for the dying
bang a drum for the truth
bang a drum for the innocence
lost in our youth
bang a drum bang it loudly
or as soft as you need
bang a drum for your brother
and a drum for me

I don't know where all the rivers run
I don't know how far, I don't know how come
but I'm gonna die believin' 
each step that I take
ain't worth the ground that
I walk on
if we don't walk it our
own way

No I don't claim to be a wiseman
a poet or a saint
I'm just another man who's searching
for a better way
but my heart beats loud as thunder
for the things that I believe
sometimes I wanna run for cover
sometimes I want to scream

Bang a drum for tomorrow
bang a drum for the past
bang a drum for the heroes
that won't come back
bang a drum for the promise
bang a drum for the lies
bang a drum for the lovers
and the tears they've cried
bang a drum bang it loudly
or as soft as you need
but as long as my heart keeps on bangin'
I got a reason to believe.
