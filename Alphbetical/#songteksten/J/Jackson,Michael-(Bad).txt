
          Bad ( Michael Jackson )


Your butt is mine , gonna tell you right . 
Just show your face in broad daylight .
I'm telling you on how I feel ,
Gonna hurt your mind don't shoot to kill
Come on , come on .
Lay on me , all right ...

I'm giving you on count of three
to show your stuff or let it be ...
I'm telling you , just watch your mouth .
I know your game , what you're about .
Well , they say the sky is the limit
and to me that's really true .
But my friend you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through ...

Refr. Because I'm bad , I'm bad - Come on
      ( Bad , bad , really , really bad )
      You know I'm bad , I'm bad - you know it
      ( Bad , bad , really , really bad )
      And the whole world has to answer right now
      Just to tell you once again , who's bad ...

The world's out , you're doin' wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lyin' eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up , don't make a fight .
Your talk is cheap you're not a man 
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands
And to me that's really true
And my friends you have seen nothin'
Just wait 'til I get through ...

Refr. Because I'm bad ...

We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm sayin'
Then won't you slap my face ...

Refr. Because I'm bad ... (4*)
