          Billie Jean            Michael Jackson 


She was more than a beauty queen from a movie scene ,
I said don't mind but a-what do you mean ?
I am the one who could've danced on the floor in the round .
She said I am the one who would dance on the floor and around.

She told me her name was Billie Jean and she caused a scene ,
Then ev'ry head turned with eyes that dreamed.
Of bein' the one who would dance on the floor in the round.

People always told me , be careful what you do.
Don't go around , breaking young girls' hearts.
And mother always told me , be careful who you love,
And be careful what you do 'cause a lie becomes the truth - hey.

Refrain

Billie Jean is not my lover ,she's just a girl who claims that
I am the one , but the kid is not my son !
She says I am the one , but the kid is not my son .


For 40 days and 40 nights I was on her side,
But who can stand when she's in demand.
Her Schemin' plans could we dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice , just remember to always think twice.
Don't think twice - don't think twice.

She told my baby , we danced till three
And she looked at men then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes were like mine - can we dance on the floor in the round - baby .

People always told me , be careful what you do ,
Don't go around , breakin' young girls' hearts.
But you came and stood right by me ,
A smell of sweet perfume - this happened much too soon.
She called me to her room - hey .

Refrain       2x

Billie Jean is not my lover ....
