  4. CHATTAHOOCHEE - ALAN JACKSON
  
  Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
  It gets hotter than a hootchee kootchee
  We laid rubber on a Georgian asphalt
  We got a little crazy but we never got caught.
  
  Down by the river on a Friday night
  Here met our cans on a pale moonlight
  Talking about cars and dreaming about women
  Never had a plan just living for the minute.
  
  Well, way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
  Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
  But I learnt how to swim and I learnt who I was
  A lot about living and a little about love.
  
  Well, we farmed up the windows in my old Chevy
  I was willing but she wasn't ready
  So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
  Dropped her off early but I didn't go home.
