
10. Scream - MICHAEL JACKSON

Tired of injustice, tired of the schemes
Kinda disgusted, so what does it mean
Kickin' me down, I got to get up
As jacket as it sounds
The whole system sucks.

Peek in the shadow, come into light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're selling out souls, but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight.

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
You bash abusin' victimize within the scheme

You try to cope with every lie
They scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can take it

Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me wanna scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just wanna scream

Tired of you tellin' the story your way
It's causin' confusion, you think it's ok

Keep changin' the rules, while you're playin' the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane

With such confusions don't it make you wanna scream
You bash abusin' victimize within the scheme

Oh you find your pleasure
Scandalizin' every lie

Chorus:
Oh father please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it
