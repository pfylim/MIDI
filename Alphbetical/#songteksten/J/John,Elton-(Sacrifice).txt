             Sacrifice             Elton John 


It's a human sign , when things go wrong 
When the scent of her lingers and temptations strong .
In to the boundary of each married man .
Sweet deceipt comes a callin'
And negativity lands
Cold , cold heart
Hard done by you 
Some things look better baby
Just passin' through

Refrain 

And it's no Sacrifice , just a simple word
It's two hearts living in two seperate worlds 
But it's no sacrifice , no sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all .


Mutual misunderstanding after the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison in the final act
We loose direction no stone unturned
No tears to damn you when jealousy burns
Cold , cold heart,
Hard done by you 
Some things look better baby
Just passin' through

Cold , cold heart 
Hard done by you 
Some things look better baby 
Just passin' through

Refrain 

And it's no sacrifice ....
