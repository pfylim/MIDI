You're a work of art

You're the highest mountain
You bring me flowers every day of my life
You save me from the worry and the strife
Take me in your arms
Baby Baby I'm on a winning streak
When I met you I reached my peak oh
Your perfect view makes me feel brand new yeah
Well you're just right
You keep me up all night up all night

You bring the spring right through my door
You're everything that's worth living for
Thrill me with your charms
Baby baby my knees are weak oh
