You're dancing with your shadow
you been talking in your sleep
well you can walk on water
but don't want to wet your feet

You really got me
you really got me no
you know I don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me

You say you talk to everyone
who's anyone in town
but they don't recognize you
with your foot out of your mouth

You really got me
you really got me no
you know I don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me

Who am I to judge a man
who says that he's his own biggest fan
it's true

You brought a knife out to a gunfight
and you're shouting that I'm dead
my old friends Smith and Wesson
think you're in over your head

You really got me
you really got me no
you know I don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me

You really got me
you really got me no
you know I don't know how you do it
but you really put me through it
you got me.
