Singer : JIMMY JAMES & THE VAGABONDS 
Title  : NOW IS THE TIME

(Now) now is the time to set things right
(Now) now is the time we should unite
We don't need revolution
We just need to open our eyes
Revolution is no solution
We ought to realize

(Now) now is the time to set things right
(Now) now is the time to see the light
Looking back to see the future
And to rid the age of nuclear
Now is the time to set things right

Take a look around
What a mess we're living in
God created love, and man
He created sin

(Now) now is the time to set things right
(Now) now is the time we should unite
We don't need revolution
We just need to open our eyes
Revolution is no solution
We ought to realize

(Now) now is the time to set things right
(Now) now is the time to see the light
Looking back to see the future
And to rid the age of nuclear
Now is the time to set things right

Taking from the earth
But never putting in
Now what becomes of man
When he has used up everything

(Now) now is the time to set things right
(Now) now is the time we should unite
We don't need revolution
We just need to open our eyes
