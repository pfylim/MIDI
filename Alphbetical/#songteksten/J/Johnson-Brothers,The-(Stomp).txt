Steppin' out the week ends open wide
Fill it up let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around in the street
Listen up for the party in feet
Slap me five that's the place we've arrieved, it's alive
Ev'rybody take it to the top we're gonna

Stomp all night in the neighbourhood
Don't it feel all right, gonna
Stomp all night wanna party
Till morning light.

Runnin', runnin', runnin'

The set is hot there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young things, short ones standing tall
Grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case.
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone
Ev'rybody take it to the top we're gonna

Stomp all night in the neghbourhood, ...

Stomp, step down in it put your foot
Where you feel the fit.
Stomp, you don't want to quit
Put your heel where you're feeling it.

Stomp all night in the neighbourhood, ...
