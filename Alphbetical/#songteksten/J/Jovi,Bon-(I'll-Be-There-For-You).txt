BON JOVI - I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU

I guess this time you're really leaving
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding
You say true love it's suicide

You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimming for the shore
And left me drowning in my tears
And you won't save me anymore

Now I'm praying to God
You'll give me one more chance girl

refrain:
I'll be there for you
These five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you
I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do
I'll be there for you

I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hiding place
Well I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday

And baby you know my hands are dirty
(Oh woman you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk I'll be the wine oh

refrain: ...

I wasn't there when you were happy
(I wasn't there to make you happy)
And I wasn't there when you were down down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
Ooh, wooh

refrain: ...2x...

Woh oh oh woh oh oh oh 
Woh oh oh Woh oh oh
Woh oh oh Woh
