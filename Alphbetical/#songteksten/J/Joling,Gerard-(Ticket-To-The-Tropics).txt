GERARD JOLING - TICKET TO THE TROPICS

Here I'm sittin' and it's getting cold
The monday rain's against my window pane
While the world it looks so cold and grey
In my mind I drift away
Thank I'm on my way to a tropic island
You would always say
I was a dreamer you were right

Refrain:
Gonna buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gonna buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can live without your love

Here I'm sittin' in the midday plane
The sun is shining on my face again
Thinking 'bout the way it had to end
Now I'm sittin' here alone
And it's not the way we were together
I want you to know I'm gonna
miss you - miss you bad

Refrain: ...
