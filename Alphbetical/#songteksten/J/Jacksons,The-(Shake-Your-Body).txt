Singer : THE JACKSONS 
Title  : SHAKE YOUR BODY

(Words & music: The Jacksons)

I don't know what's going to happen to you, baby
But I do know that I love you
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky
And I do know that I want you

Chorus:
Let's dance, let's shout
Shake your body down to the ground

You tease me with your loving to play hard to get
'Cause you do know that I want you
You walk around this town with your
Head all up in the sky
And you do know that I want you

Chorus: ...4x...

You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me
And you know that I love it
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul
And you do know that I want to

Chorus: ...4x...
