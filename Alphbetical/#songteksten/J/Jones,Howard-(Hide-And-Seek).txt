HOWARD JONES - HIDE AND SEEK

There was a time when there was
Nothing at all, nothing at all
Just a distant hum
There was a being and he lived on his
Own he had no one to talk to
And nothing to do
He drew up the plans, learned to work
With his hands
A million years passed by and his work
was done
And his words were these

Refrain:
Hope you find it in everything
Everything that you see
Hope you find it in everything
Everything that you see
Hope you find it, hope you find it
Hope you find me in you

So she had built her elaborate home
With it's ups and downs
It's rains and it's sun
She decided that her work, it was done
Time to have fun
And found a game to play
Then as a part of the game
She completely forgot where she'd hidden
herself
And she spent the rest of her time trying
To find the parts

Refrain: ...

There was a time when there was
Nothing at all, nothing at all
Just a distant hum
