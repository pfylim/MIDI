9. SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN - BON JOVI

Happiness, it's been no friend to me
But forever after ain't what's it's all cracked up to be
Yeah I had a taste you were my fantasy
but I almost lost my faith when I hit reality
I don't need no Guru to tell me what to do
When your feeling like a headline on
Yestarday's news

Come on come on come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for my blues
Give me something for the pain
When I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something for the pain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right, something like you
Come on come on come on 
Loneliness has found a home in me
My suitcase and guitar are my only family
I tried to need someone like they needed me
Well I opened up my heart but all I did was bleed
I don't need no lover, just to get screwed
They don't make a bandage that's going to cover my bruise

Come on come on come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for my blues
Give me something for the pain
When I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something for the pain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right, something like you
Come on come on come on

Pull me under (help I'm falling)
Run through my vein (Night is calling)
To a place (feel like I'm flying)
Where I feel no pain (Christ I'm dying)
Be the pillow under my head
Give me cover when I'm in bed
Take me higher than I've ever been
Take me down and back again
Come to me, be my disguise
Open your coat, let me crawl inside
Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for my blues
Give me something for the pain
When I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something for the pain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right, something like you
Give me something for the pain
Give me something for my blues
Give me something for the pain
When I feel I've been danglin' from a hang-man's noose
Give me something for the pain
Give me something I can use
To get me through the night
Make me feel all right, something like you
Come on come on come on
Come on come on come on, come on, come on
Gimme, gimme something for the pain 
Gimme, gimme something for the blues, oh yeah
Gimme, gimme something for the pain 
Gimme
