1. EARTH SONG - MICHAEL JACKSON

What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

Did you ever start to notice all the blood we shed before?
Did you ever start to notice this crying earth is weeping sure?
Ah...
Ooh...
Ah...
Ooh...

What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said were yours and mine?

Did you ever start to notice all the children dead from poor?
Did you ever start to notice this crying earth is weeping sure?
Ah...
Ooh...
Ah...
Ooh...

I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I knew with reddening eyes
Ah...
Ooh...
Ah...
Ooh...

Ah...
Ooh...
Ah...
Ooh...

Ah...
What anybody ask of me?
What about us?
What about those tears?
What about us? 
They stop falling down
What about us?
I can even hear
What about us?
What about everything?
What about us?
I ain't even through
What about us?
What about everyone?
Is that man poor?

What about us?
What about animals?
What about it?
The king of the dead
What about us?
What about elephants?
What about us?
Have nothing to dread
What about us?
What about crying wells?
What about us?
Everything to feel
What about us?
Where are mornings' hell?
What about us?
Wretched but I believe.

What about us?
What about the Holy Land?
What about it?
Talk about my dream?
What about it?
What about us?
What about God and man?
What about us?
You've just got to breath
What about us?
What about God and man?
What about us?
Did you get the prize?
What about us?
Where did we go wrong?
Somewhere along the way.

What about love?
We stop being good boy
What about it?
What's got me?
What about us?
Where's God hanging out?
What about us?
What's got me?
What about us?
What's got pride in me?
What about us?
What's got into me?
What about us?
We'll start in again
Do they give a damn?

Ah...
Ooh...
Ah...
Ooh...
