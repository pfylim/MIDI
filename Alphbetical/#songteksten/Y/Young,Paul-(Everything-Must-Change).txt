PAUL YOUNG - EVERYTHING MUST CHANGE

I was never one to back out of an
argument
And say I was wrong
Even when I'd seen the other side
I'd hide my foolishness and carry on
But still I'd be embarrassed
'Cause they'd play along
Until I'd back myself into a corner
I would only realize when they had gone

Refrain:
And like a dream, a life, a reason
Everything must change
And like a world, this earth and seasons
Everything must change

In the same way when we disagree
You know I wouldn't be the one to back down
But still I'd know that you had faith in me
Tell me something am I letting you down
'Cause when I woke up and I saw the note
You pressed into the mirror frame
But it was easy
