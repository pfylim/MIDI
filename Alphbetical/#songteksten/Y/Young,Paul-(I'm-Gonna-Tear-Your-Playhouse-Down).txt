Title  : I'm Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down
Singer : Paul Young


You think you've got it all set up
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm everyone you see
And play in any game you can
But I've got news for you
I hope it won't hit you too hard
One of these days while you're at play
I'm gonna catch you off guard

Chorus:
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down room by room

You make our lives a stress and strain
Using a power play
All you do is pass around
Hearts you use as playtoys
You've been playin' mammy
With every man in town
So what you gonna do
When you look up one day
And see your playhouse tumblin' down

Chorus

You think you've got it all set up
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm everyone you see
And play in any game you can
You've been playin' mammy
With every man in town
So what you gonna do
When you look up one day
And see your playhouse tumblin' down

Chorus
