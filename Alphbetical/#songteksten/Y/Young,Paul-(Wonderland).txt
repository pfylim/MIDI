PAUL YOUNG - WONDERLAND

(Words & music: B. Cook)

Oh oh
Let me take you babe

For all your worried weakness all will be revealed
And for all your troubled sweetnesses your troubles will be healed
Close your eyes, close your eyes
Oh now
Let me rise, let me rise

Oh I see you in a dress of blue with a question in your hand
And I see you in your attitude of sorrow and demand oh
Close your eyes, close your eyes oh

Refrain:
Let me take you back to wonderland
I will take you back to wonderland

Wherever there's an empty space split the time in two
And when you come to claim your place I'll see you smiling through
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Refrain: ...

Are your eyes so tired of searching that they can't see love
And is your heart so full of locks and keys that it can't open up

Do do do do
Na na na

Through all the things that have to be
We often have to cry
And beneath the weight of gravity
We stumble then we fly
Hold my hand, hold my hand

Refrain: ...

Let me take you back to wonderland oh oh
Let me take you there oh yeah
I will take you back to wonderland
(I need somebody)
