
8. LICK IT - 20 FINGERS

Boom-Ba-Da-Da-Da...
Baby work it 
I met
A real cutie
He had a nice tight booty
He seemed to be
The freaky lover type
Let's cut right
Through the chase
C'mon and get a taste
I've got to face it
So that I can get hype
Chorus:
You gotta lick it
Before we kick it
Ya gotta take that extra step
So we can kick it (2x)

Boomba- Da - Da - Da
Baby work it (8x)

My lips 
Are sweet as candy
I need a man
That's handy 
Don't be a tease
Just gimme what I like
I'm full of freakiness
So come & get with this
& make me purr
So we
Can do this right

Chorus (2x)
Boomba-Da-Da-Da-Da
Baby work it (8x)

You know men are dogs
So go bark up
Somebody else's tree
Here boy come and get it.

Chorus:
