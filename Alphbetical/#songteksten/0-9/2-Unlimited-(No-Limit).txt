No no limits, we'll reach for the sky! No valley to deep. No mountain
too high. No no limits, won't give up the fight! We do what we want
and we do it with pride.

Lemme hear ya say yeah! (yeah!)

Rap 1:

Hard to the core, I feel the floor. When I'm on stage, yo, ya answer
more.I'm on the edge, I know the ledge, I work real hard to collect my
cash! Tick tick ticka tick take your time, when I'm goin' I'm goin'
for mine. Open your ears and you will hear it. I tell you this 'cause
there's no limit!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no ,no ,no, no, no, no there's no limit!

(CHORUS)

Ow! Hey yay yeah hey hey! Now, now, hey yeah yeh hey hey! Hoo!

Rap 2:

No limits allowed, cause there's much crowd, microphone check as I
choose my route. I'm playing on the road; I've got no fear, the
south from my mouth is on record here. There never will be no mountain
too high. Reach the top, touch the sky! They tried to diss me cause I
sell out...I'm making techno and I am proud!
