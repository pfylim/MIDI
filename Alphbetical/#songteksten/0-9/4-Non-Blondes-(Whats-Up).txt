 Titel:  What's Up?
 Artist: 4 Non-Blondes


 25 years and my life is still
 I'm tryin' to get up that great big hill
 Of hope, for a destination
 I realized quickly when I knew I should
 That the world was made up of this brotherhood
 of man, for whatever that means.

 And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
 to get it all out
 What's in my head
 And then I start feeling a little peculiar
 So I wake in the morning and I step outside
 I take a deep breath and I get real high
 And I scream at the top of my lungs
 What's going on

 I said hey yeah yeah yeah
 Hey yeah yeah
 I said hey, What's goin' on

 I try all the time
 in this institution
 and I pray, oh my god do I pray
 I pray every single day
 for a revolution.

 so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
 to get it all out what's in my head
 then I start feeling a little peculiar
 so I wake in the morning and I step outside
 I take a deep breath and I get real high
 then I scream at the top of my lungs
 what's going on

and I say hey ....

25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big
hill of hope
for a destination
