  DREAM ON - Nazareth
  
  Dream on
  Though it's hard to tell
  Though you're fooling yourself
  Dream on 
  Dream on
  You can't hide away
  There is nothing to say
  So dream on
  Dream on
  Though it's hard to tell
  Though you're fooling yourself
  Dream on.
  
  You can laugh at me
  Because I'm crying
  You can tell your friends
  How much I begged you to stay
  You can live your fantasy without me
  But you'll never know
  How much I needed you.
  
  Dream on
  It's not easy for you
  Though I'm looking at you
  Dream on 
  Dream on
  You can never see
  What you're doing to me
  So dream on.
  
  You can cross your heart
  And still be lying
  You can count the reasons 
  Why you floated away
  You can give your life away
  Without me
  But you'll never know 
  How much I needed you.
  
  You can laugh at me
  Because I'm crying
  You can tell your friends
  How much I begged you to stay
  You can live your fantasy without me
  But you'll never know
  How much I needed you.
  
  Dream on
  It's not easy for you
  Though I'm looking at you
  Dream on 
  Dream on
  You can never see
  What you're doing to me
  So dream on
  Dream on
  Though it's hard to tell
  Though you're fooling yourself
  Dream on
  Dream on.
