Singer : JOHNNY NASH 
Title  : TEARS ON MY PILLOW

I can't take it, I'm so lonely
Gee I need you so
I can't take it, for I wonder
Why you had to go

But baby, ev'ry night I wake up crying
Tears on my pillow and pain in my heart
And you on my mind

I remember all the good times
That we had before
I remember and now my heart
My very soul cries out for more

And baby, all your love for me is dying
Tears on my pillow and pain in my heart
And you on my mind

I'll always remember that day you promised
to love me, you said, you'd love me to
the very end
And I'll never forget, I'll never forget
when you walked away from me
You walked out of my life with
My very best friend, oh

Baby, ev'ry night I wake up crying
Tears on my pillow and pain in my heart
And you on my mind
