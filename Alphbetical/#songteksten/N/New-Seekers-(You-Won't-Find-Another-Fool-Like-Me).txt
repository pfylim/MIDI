Singer : NEW SEEKERS
Title  : YOU WON'T FIND ANOTHER FOOL LIKE ME

You won't find another fool like me babe (no you won't)
Who'd sit around all night and wait for you
And close their eyes to oh so many lies
No-one else could love you like I do
I wanna tell you

You won't find another clown like me babe (no you won't)
I can't count the times you said you'd leave
You know dam well you're fooling
'Cause wherever you may go
You won't find another fool like me

Sometimes I can't understand
What makes me the fool that I am
Then you touch my hands and suddenly I know

Even though you treat me like you do babe (you know you do)
I'm so hooked on you I can't get free
But I'll get through the bad times
'Cause in my heart I know
That you won't find another fool like me

La la la (etc)

Give me just a sign you may need me sometimes
I fall for that old game you always play boy
You won't find another clown like me babe (no you won't)
I can't count the times you said you'd leave
You know dam well you're fooling
'Cause wherever you may go
You won't find another fool like me
No no
You'll never find another fool like me
