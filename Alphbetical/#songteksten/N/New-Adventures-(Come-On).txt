Singer : NEW ADVENTURES
Title  : COME ON

(Words & music: Chuck Berry)

Everything is wrong
Since me and my baby parted
All day long I'm walking
'Cause I can't afford to check it
Laid off from my job
And I can't afford to check it
Wish somebody'd come along
And run into it and wreck it

Come on, since my baby parted
Come on can't get started
Come on I can't afford to check it
I wish somebody'd come along
And run into it and wreck it

Everything is wrong
Since I've been without you
Ev'ry night I lie awake
Thinkin' about you
Ev'ry time the phone rings
Sounds like thunder
Some stupid jerk tryin' 
To reach another number

Come on, since I've been without you
Come on, steady thinkin' 'bout you
Come on sounds like thunder
There's some stupid jerk
Tryin' to reach another number

Everything is wrong
Since I last saw you baby
I really want to see you
And I don't mean maybe
I'm doin' everything
Tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you honey
And you belong to me
So come on, I wanna see you baby
Come on, I don't mean maybe
Come on I'm tryin' to make you see
That I belong to you and you belong to me
