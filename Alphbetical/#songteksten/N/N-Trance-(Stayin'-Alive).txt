STAYIN' ALIVE - n-Trance

Get raw with the fever on the dance floor.

Now who got the fever for the play?
Who can take the way that I flex 
So can a tramp come on a rampage
We can work all day with the nappa stuck on my lip
They would be rollin' the mad joints
So put your heads under here
'Cause there's a party up ahead
So grab yourself a beer
Uh, we can get our fever rollin'
I'm with it, so let me put my big brown feet forward
I'm coming with the disco
I can flip so
I'm a try a solo tip
Something for the honeys in the crowd
Let me get red
So I can turn the party out
Till tomorrow afternoon
'Cause when I grace my style
No one leaves the room 
So tell me
Can you feel the nice girls coming with the fever, fever, fever? 

Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.

Get raw with the fever on the dance floor.

Step to the side
You got to run and hide 
Move to the side
Everybody wants to stay alive.

Everybody's in the house
We have to warm this bed
So you can break your fliz
Impress on the lonely one
We got to go with one
So let me get my fleb in order
Hit the brass on the past any heard of
Me and the boys comin' down with murder
And it's gotta be the way
Everybody wants to make a move
So just party
We can have a jam
So get your move on 
I'm gonna take the screws and slam
Flip it, how it wanna flip 
From the back to the front
When I talk and read the manuscript
'Cause I got the moves
And I'm always on the floor
With the crazy, crazy grooves
So tell me
Can you feel the nice girls coming with the fever, fever, fever? 

Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.

Get raw with the fever on the dance floor.

Step to the side
You got to run and hide 
Move to the side
Everybody wants to stay alive.

Step to the side
You got to run and hide 
Move to the side
Everybody wants to stay alive.

Everybody in the house
Come on and let me hear you say
Ho (ho)
Everybody in the house
Come on and let me hear you say
Ho ho (ho ho)
Everybody in the house
Come on and let me hear you say
Ho (ho)
Everybody in the house
Come on and let me hear you say
Ho ho ho (ho ho ho).

It's about time
Everybody in the house put the move
To my official rule round
We could rip on a tip 
With my boys bringing disco noise
As I crop the wickedness
Gettin' sharp with the flow
We took a Bee Gee's flip
And broke it down like keko
And disconnect that deeper 
'Cause we got to get with the fever, fever, fever.

Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive.

Get raw with the fever on the dance floor.
