6. FLYING  - NICE LITTLE PINGUINS

Here I am, I'm on my own
For the first time really on my own
So will I make it, will it work all right
Can I make it through the night
And I go Uh...I'm flyin'
Uh,...in open space.
Look at me, I'm riding high
I'm the airborne master of the sky
And everything beneath me seems to fade
Without a trace, without a shade.
And I go Uh, ...I'm flyin'
Uh, Uh, ...in open space.
And everything beneath me seems to fade
Without a trace, without a shade.
And I go Uh, ...I'm flyin'
Uh, ...in open space.
And I go Uh, ...I'm flyin'
Uh, ...in open space.
