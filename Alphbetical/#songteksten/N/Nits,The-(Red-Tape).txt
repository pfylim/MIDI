Title  : Red Tape
Singer : The Nits


She was always thinking
That the others were the losers
And that they could never kill her too
This the official world
Now welcome to the papers
And the forms are waiting here for you

It didn't  work at all
She couldn't stand or fall
(2x)

Queueing up for counters
She was standing there for hours
And then someone told her it is closed
Bureaucrat, tie and hat
Disappearing like a ghost

It didn't work at all
She couldn't stand or fall
(2x)

Late at night the kids in bed
She's looking at the tv-screen
One more night she's talking to
The window of the washing machine

It didn't work at all
She couldn't stand or fall
(2x)
