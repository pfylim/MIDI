Title  : King Kong Five
Singer : Mano Negra


Listen to the beat
Of the song song
Buzzin' in my head head head
Like a bum bum
Twits and Jerks
They do the boogie
Like one big flop
They don't know about the soul wine habit club
I song my songs and I'm a rocker
Burnin' up with the Puta's Fever
Paris Paris is not a place to be
For a little monkey, little frenchy chimpanzee
Who's never been on the scene
"I've never been on the scene, but I can dream
That we" Standin' alive
We're the king kong five
Doin' the king kong jive
On the Gabony boogie
Now what's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
I'm playin' like shakin' under the coconut tree
