Black sails in the moonlight
black patch on your eye
you shiver your timbers baby
and I'll shiver mine.

A treasure map is hidden on your legs
your veins are very close
someday I'll wrap my big yardarms
around your legs and sail away.

I'll bury my heart on some island
and take you there someday to find it
I want you I need you I love you
no other man will ever read your legs.

but you're so veiny
but you're so veiny you probably
think this map belongs to you
and I'm so crazy
what can I do
so raise the anchor
and hoist the canvas
and sail into my heart.
