Oh, the Wayward Wind
is a restless wind.
A restless wind that yearns to wander;
And he was born the next of kin,
The next of kin to the wayward wind.

In a lonely shack by a railroad track
he spent his younger days.
And I guess the sound of the outward bound
made him a slave to his wandrin' ways.

Oh, the Wayward Wind
is a restless wind.
A restless wind that yearns to wander;
And he was born the next of kin,
The next of kin to the wayward wind.

Oh I met him there in a border town
he vowed we'd never part.
'Tho he tried his best to settle down
I'm now alone with abroken heart.

Oh, the Wayward Wind
is a restless wind.
A restless wind that yearns to wander;
And he was born the next of kin,
The next of kin to the wayward wind.
