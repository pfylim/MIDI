Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire

Me and you, you
In the heat of the sun our live has begun like a flame

Me and you, you
All alone in the sun, I burn in your hand and my soul will rise to the sun

Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a fire, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch your fire

Me and you, you
In the night we will hide in the flow of the tight on the shore

Me and you, you
As a message for me in the sound of the see I must hold you and never let go

Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a fire, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch your fire

You're just gone before
All you need, you can have that
All my, all my, all my love

Wohohohoho, Yeah Yeah
Wohohohoho, fire, fire
Catch a fire

Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire
Catch a fire, catch a fire
Catch a wind, catch a rainbow, catch a fire......
