  I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU (WHITNEY HOUSTON)
  
  If I should stay,
  I would only be in your way,
  So I'll go, but I know
  I'll think of you every step of the way.
  And I will always love you,
  Will always love you,
  You my darling you
  Bitter sweet memories
  That is all I am taking with me so
  
  Good-bye, please don't cry
  We both know I'm not what you you need
  
  And I will always love you
  Will always love you
  I hope life treats you kind
  And I hope you have all you dreamed of,
  And I wish you joy and happiness,
  But above all of this,
  I wish you love
  And I will always love you,
  Will always love you
  I will always love you
