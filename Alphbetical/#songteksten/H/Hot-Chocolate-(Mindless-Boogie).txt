As the bomb goes Neutron
so for you and I
will the finger on the button decide
if we live or if we die ?
The more you think, think,
the more you blow your mind.
The more you search for a peace here
the less that you will find.

Dance mindless boogie till we drop, don't stop.
Music is the drug,
music is the drug we're searching for.
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boggie,
boogie, boogie, boogie, don't stop.
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie,
boogie, boogie, boogie till we drop.
Dance, dance.

nine hundred or more commit mass suicide in Jonestown
very strange, very strange,
more than ever
the world needs god's helping hand.
Confused, we don't seem to know
what we're doin',
like a blind man
spinnin' round in space.

Dance mindless boogie till we drop, don't stop,...

Like clownes and robots that we are,
music is the drug we're searchin' for.
Mindless boogie, boogie, boogie, boogie,...
