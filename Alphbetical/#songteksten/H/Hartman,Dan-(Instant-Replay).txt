Title  : INSTANT REPLAY

(Words & music: Dan Hartman)

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five
Four three, two, one
Ah wah wah wah

You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You got a special way to move me
Can't stop now, let's do it again

You keep me dancin' through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh, I can't get enough, no I can't get enough

Chorus:
Instant replay, got to have it
Instant replay, oh, oh, instant replay
Got to have your love again

I feel so good about us
I found a shining star
And when I look into your eyes, it's magic
Well I know this can't be a dream
I'm so happy must be real
In every way it's getting stronger
Now you know it, let me show it

Chorus: ...

Instant replay, got me floatin' on a cloud
Got me dancin' all around all around all around

Instant replay
Instant replay, I need it, I need it
Instant replay, hey hey hey
I need your love again, once again, once again
Instant replay, got your number
Instant replay, I'm gonna call you up now
Instant replay, got me floating on a cloud
Got me dancin' all around
Instant replay
