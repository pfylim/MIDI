THE HERREY'S - DIGGI-LOO DIGGI-LEY

Golden reflections
Given directions
Bringing the best that I have right out of me
How in this world could this be
Filling your senses
with burning desire
Climbing the fences
That's taking you up higher
Now I believe I can make it
Oh what a wonderful world

Refrain:
Diggi-loo, diggi-ley
Life is going my way
When I'm walking in my golden shoes
Everything I ever dreamed of
Has suddenly come true
Diggi-loo, diggi-ley
Let this miracle stay
I could be whatever I would choose
Please don't wake me up I'm dreaming
of me in golden shoes

I know my dream was a fantasy illusion
But when I woke up
I came to the conclusion
I can be what I want to
Oh oh, lightning and thunder
Magic (and) wonder
I don't know how but it did happen to me
You felt your heart was set free
What a sensation
You're flying up high now
Sweet inspiration
You're going to the sky now
Couldn't believe I was dreaming
Couldn't believe it was true

Refrain: ...
