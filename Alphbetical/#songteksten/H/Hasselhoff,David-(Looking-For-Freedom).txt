
   Looking for freedom          David Hasselhoff 89 


One morning in june, some 20 years ago
I was born a rich man's son
I had ev'ry thing - what money could buy
but freedom - I had none

I've been looking for freedom - I've been looking so long
                              - still the search goe's on
                              - since I left my home town
                              - still it can't be found

I headed down the trap with my baggage on my back
I left the city fore behind (uh ..)
Walking down the road, with my heavy load
trying was a piece of mine (mhm,...)
father said, you'll be sorrow, son
if you have your home this way
and when you realize the freedom my advice
you'll be coming home - some day

I've been looking . . .

Solo

I made a lot of dues - had many to loose
travelling across the land
hooked up the phone - had muscles on my arms
and still I'm not a self made man

I've been on the run for many years to come
I've been searching door to door
and give me some time - some day I'm gonna find
the freedom (freedom) - I've been searching for.

I've been looking . . .   (3x)
