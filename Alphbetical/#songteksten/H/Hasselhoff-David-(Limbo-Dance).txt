       Limbo Dance         David Hasselhoff


Refrain

Limbo cool, limbo fine,
Everybody gets a chance.
Clap your hands, it's party time,
Do the limbo dance.

Let's go on a holiday,
(let's go to Jamaica)
Flying to Montego Bay,
(let's go to Jamaica)
Maybe find a hideaway,
(let's go to Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand, to a steeldrum band.

Everybody say 

Refrain

Limbo cool, limbo fine,
Everybody gets a chance.
Come on and move your body down,
Do the limbo dance.

Limbo cool, limbo fine, 
Everybody gets a chance.
Clap your hands, it's party time,
Do the limbo dance.

You will hear the limbo song,
(when you're in Jamaica)
You'll be dancing all night long,
(when you're in Jamaica)
We can party on and on
(when you're in Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand, to a steeldrum band.

Refrain

Limbo cool, limbo fine, ...

Fantasies can all come true,
(let's stay in Jamaica)
Golden sun will shine on you,
(let's stay in Jamaica)
Sleeping under skies of blue,
(let's stay in Jamaica)
We can limbo on the sand, to a steeldrum band.

Refrain

Limbo cool, limbo fine, ...
