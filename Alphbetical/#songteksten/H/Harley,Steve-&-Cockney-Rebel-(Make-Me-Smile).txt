Singer : STEVE HARLEY & COCKNEY REBEL 
Title  : MAKE ME SMILE

You've done it all you've broken every code
And pulled the rebel to the floor
You spoilt the game, no matter what you say
For only metal what a bore
Blue eyes, blue eyes
How come you tell so many lies
Come up and see me make me smile
Or do what you want run on wild

There's nothing left, all gone and run away
Maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test a game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile
Resist, resist it's from yourself you have to hide
Come up and see me make me smile
Or do what you want run on wild

There ain't no more, you've taken ev'rything
From my believe in mother earth
Can you ignore my faith in ev'rything
'Cause I know what faith is and what it's worth
Away away and don't say maybe you'll try
To come up and see me make me smile
Or do what you want run on wild

Ooh la la la ooh la la la ooh
Come up and see me make me smile
Or do what you want run on wild
