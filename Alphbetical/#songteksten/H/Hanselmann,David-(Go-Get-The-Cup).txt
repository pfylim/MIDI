                             GO GET THE CUP

     As performed by: David Hanselmann          


     We came from far away, wanting to see today,
     who's number one in the world...
     we're gonna shake it up, we're gonna take it up,
     gonna give it a whirl.....

     Everyone wants to win, so let the game begin,
     stand up an' sing it out loud...
     excitement is comin', the air is hummin',...
     give us the roar of the crow--ow-ow-ow-owd.....
     and may the best team wi--in...

     Go..get the cup,...on with the game...
     reach for a star,...follow your dream,..together
     Go..get the cup,...on with the game...
     reach for a star,...follow your drea--ea-ea-ea-eam...

     BRIDGE.........................................
