Well, you give me all your lovin'
and your turtle dovin',
All your hugs an' kisses
an' your money too;
Well, you know you love me, baby,
until you tell me, maybe,
that someday, well, I'll be through !

Well, that'll be the day,
when you say, goodbye, yes,
that'll be the day, 
when you make me cry,
ah you say you're gonna leave me,
you know it's a lie, 'cause
that'll be the day,
when I die.

When cupid shot his dart,
he shot it at your heart,
so if we ever part
and I leave you,
you say you told me 
an' you told me boldly,
that some day, well, I'll be through.

Well, that'll be the day,
when you say, goodbye, yes,
that'll be the day, 
when you make me cry,
ah you say you're gonna leave me,
you know it's a lie, 'cause
that'll be the day,
when I die.
