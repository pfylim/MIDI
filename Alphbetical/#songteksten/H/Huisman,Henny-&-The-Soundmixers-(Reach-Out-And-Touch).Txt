Title  : Reach Out And Touch
Singer : Henny Huisman & The Soundmixers


Refrein:
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
Make this world a better place
if you can
(2x), just try

Take a little time out of your busy day
To give encouragement to someone
Who's lost the way, just try
Would I be talking to a stone
If I asked you to share a problem
That's not your own, oh no
We can change things, if we start giving
Why don't you

Refrein

If you see an old friend on the street
And he's down
Remember his shoes could fit your feet
Just try
Try a little kindness and you'll see
It's something that comes
Very naturally, oh yeah
We can change things, if we start giving
Why don't you, why don't you
Reach out and Touch somebody's hand

Refrein (2x)
