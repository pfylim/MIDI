Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt,
and for all the little piggies life is getting worse
always having dirt to play around in.
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts,
you will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
always have clean shirts to play around in.
In their styes with all their backing 
they don't care what goes around
in their eyes there's something lacking 
what they need's damn good wacking.
Ev'rywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives.
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.
