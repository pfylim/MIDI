                  Hungry Eyes


I've been meaning to tell you I've got this feeling
that won't subside I look at you and
I fantasize you're mine tonight

Refrain   

Now I've got you in my sights with these hungry eyes
one look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes I feel the magic between you 
and I


I wanna hold you so hear me out
I wanna show you what love's all about
darlin' tonight

Refrain

Now I've got you in my sights with these hungry eyes
one look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes I feel the magic between you 
and I

I've got hungry eyes now I've got you in my sights
with a hungry eyes now did I take you by surprise
I need to see this love was meant to be

I've got hungry eyes one look at you
and I can't sidquise I've got hungry eyes
did I take you by surprise hungry eyes I need you
hungry eyes now I've got you in my sights
with the hungry eyes
