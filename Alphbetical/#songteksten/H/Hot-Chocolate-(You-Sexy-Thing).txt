Singer : HOT CHOCOLATE 
Title  : YOU SEXY THING 
 
I believe in miracles, where you from you sexy thing? 
(Sexy thing you) 
I believe in miracles, since you came along, you sexy thing 
Where did you come from angel? 
How did you know, to come to me 
How did you know, I need you so badly 
How did you know, I'd give my heart gladly 
Yesterday I was one of the lonely people 
Now you're laying next to me 
Making love to me 
 
I believe in miracles, where you from you sexy thing? 
(Sexy thing you) 
I believe in miracles, since you came along, you sexy thing 
Where did you come from baby 
How did you know, you're everything prayed for 
how did you know, every night and day  
you've been love and satisfaction 
Now you're lying next to me, giving it to me
