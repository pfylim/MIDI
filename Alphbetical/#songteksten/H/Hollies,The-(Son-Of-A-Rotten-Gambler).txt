Singer : THE HOLLIES 
Title  : SON OF A ROTTEN GAMBLER

And his love
Will be his vision
And he'll take you
Where you stand
And will you stand
Your life by his, and help the boy
Become a man

Refrain:
Will he be the son of his father
His father the teacher
Teachin' love and honesty
And bein' his own man handler
Or the son of
The son of a run of the mill run
Rotten gambler

Will the devil
Be gettin' to you
As you look back
Over what you've done
And what you've done
Was it for reason of for rhyme
Or was it just for fun?

Refrain: ...

Back on the road now
Deacon will loose your hand
There ain't no kingdom for the gamblin' man
You know the road now
And you have made your stand
And when his eyes shine upon you

Refrain: ...(2x)...

The son of a rotten gambler (7x)
