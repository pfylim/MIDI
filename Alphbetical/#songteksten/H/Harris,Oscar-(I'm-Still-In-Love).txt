Title  : I'M STILL IN LOVE 

(Words & music: J. Zwart)

Chorus:
I'm still in love with you
I don't know what to do
'Cause when I see your face
You make me feel
That it's nice and true

I'm still in love with you
I don't know what to do
'Cause when I look at you

I can't go on when you're gone
Haven't said I love you
When I look at your smile
I will surely be true
You are sweet, so divine
And I'm feeling so fine
I will hold you close
'Cause surely you are mine

Chorus: ...
