Singer : HEATWAVE 
Title  : GROOVE LINE

(Words & music: Rod Temperton)

Pack your grip, takin' you on a trip
Ain't no seats, all we got's dancin' feet
Leave your worries behind
'Cause rain shine don't mind
We're riding on the groove line tonight

We got the wheels turnin'
You know we won't stop
We got this boiler burnin'
We're keepin' it hot
So grab your friends, get the train comin' thru
Climb on board, where you leave's up to you
Leave your worries behind
'Cause rain shine don't mind
We're ridin' on the groove line tonight

Groove line tonight
Ah ah, we're ridin' on the groove line tonight
