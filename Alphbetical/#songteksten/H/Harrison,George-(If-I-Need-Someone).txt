Titel:        IF I NEEDED SOMEONE

Interpret:    GEORGE HARRISON

---------------------------------------------------------------------

If I needed someone to love,
you're the one that I'd be thinking of,
if I needed someone.

If I had some more time to spend,
then I guess I'd be with you my friend,
if I needed someone.

Had you come some other day, 
then it might not have been like this.
But you see now I'm too much in love.

Carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me,
If I needed someone.
Ah, Ah.
