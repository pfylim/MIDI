WHITNEY & CHRISSY HOUSTON - I KNOW HIM SO WELL

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet presented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments who can tell
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know I know him well

Wasn't it good, wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't me mine
But in the end he needs a little bit more than before
Security he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back I could've played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then
Now at least I know I know him well
Wasn't it good, wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't me mine
Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart

Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't me mine
But in the end he needs a little bit more than before
Security he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well
It took some time to understand him
I know him so well
