I wanna rock you in my wildest dreams

Interpret:Engelbert Humperdinck



I would cry and ill die if youll leave girl
ill be loosing the best part of me
yes i know we can make it together
there is somethings that just have to be
let me take you to the moon we can capture stars
if you need love like Ido heavens not to far


I wanna rock you in my wildest dreams
I wanna kiss you babe endlessly
I wanna love you with all my heart and all my soul
until I loose control
I wanna rock you in my wildest dreams
come on I gotta show you what I mean
Ill tell you something if you give in without a fight
we can make a start tonight


theres an ache in my heart when I see you
the power you  hold over me
and I know it will never stop flowing

now were locked in our own fantasy
you are lying endlessly and Im burning with desire

I could feel the magic of your kiss
setting me on fire.
