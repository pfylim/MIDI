Singer : ALIDES HIDDING
Title  : HOLLYWOOD SEVEN

(Words & music: Gloria Sklerov/Harry Lloyd)

She came in one night from Omaha
Worn out 'cause she never could sleep on trains
Took a bus to Hollywood, looking for a room
in the pouring rain
Hair so blonde, her eyes so brown
She thought she'd take this town and turn it upside down
I was living in a hotel just off Sunset
She moved in, across the hall
She said she'd be a movie star and waited every morning for 
the call
I asked her in for a drink, but she hardly had the time
Her call might come tomorrow, she had to know her lines

Chorus:
Hollywood seven, rooms to rent till your name goes up in lights
Hollywood seven, you can dream your dreams for seven bucks a 
night
Hollywood seven, rooms to rent till your name goes up in lights
Hollywood seven, you can dream your dreams for seven bucks a 
night

Now the months went by without a job
The money that she saved was nearly spent
She started bringing strangers home
Had to find a way to pay the rent
She'd sit and drink coffee with nothin' much to say
Just busy rehearsing in her mind the scene she'd never play

Chorus: ...

I found her there one morning
When she didn't come for coffee when I called
She brought the wrong one home
This time there were crazy lipstick scrawls across the wall
Now she's going back to Omaha
But not the way she planned
There'll be no crowd to cheer her on
No welcome home, no band

Chorus: ...
