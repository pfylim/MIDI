MURRAY HEAD - ONE NIGHT IN BANGKOK

Bangkok! Oriental setting
And the city don't know what the city is getting
The creme de la creme of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies - doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean spa had the chess boys in it
All change - don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland - or the Philippines - or Hastings
- or this place!

REFRAIN 1:
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces brother
It's a drag it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddaya mean? You've seen one crowded
polluted, stinking town
Tea girls - warm and sweet - warm and sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite

Get Thaid! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine

REFRAIN 2:
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstacy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walking next to me

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a
Muddy old river or reclining Buddha
And thank God I'm only watching the game -
controlling it

I don't see you guys ratings
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you better go back to your bars, your
temples, your massage parlors

REFRAIN 1 + 2: ...
