Lonesome tears sad and blue,
I shed lonesome tears for you,
guess you know I know why I cried
when you said goodbye.
When you left and you said I'm gone,
lonesome tears fell all night long.

Yes you know I know I cried when you said goodbye.

You left me here all alone.
Hear me callin', won't you come back home.
Love me like you did before,
Now need I tell you more ?
Lonesome tears, sad and blue,
I shed Lonesome tears for you.

Guess you know I know I cried when you said goodbye.
