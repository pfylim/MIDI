Singer : THE HOLLIES 
Title  : FALLING CALLING

Didn't believe in the Bible
Didn't believe in the good book
Lord Lord please help me
Help me take a look
These chains that I'm wearing
Really ain't my style
Lord Lord please help me
Help me think a while

Got into bad ways
Well the judge yes he put me down
For five thousand days
Falling falling falling over you
Falling falling I don't know what to do
Falling falling falling over you
Calling calling I don't know what to do

The cell I'm in is only six feet wide
And six feet to the roof
There's a window that's strung
With only three bars
Singing me the truth fifty and seventy
Don't seem right
Seventy ain't my age when I leave
The place with a new face
It's the turning of a new page

Falling falling falling over you
Falling falling I don't know what to do
Falling falling falling over you
Calling calling I don't know what to do
