SHELTERED HEART

Text + Musik: Diane Warren
Interpret   : David Hasselhoff
--------------------------------------------------------


I needed protection
needed a place to hide
I wanted
a fortress
so love couldn't get inside
and
I made it strong and tall
I swore I'd never see it fall
and no one at all
could break through this sheltered heart
--------------------------------------------------------
Break through this sheltered heart
break through this sheltered heart
oh won't you tear down the walls
I've buil5t all around me
I wanna learn to win
I think I could love again
break down these walls
break down this sheltered heart
--------------------------------------------------------
Been keeping
my distance safe
behind this guarded wall
concealing my feelings
till I couldn't feel at all
and I closed and locked the door
but maybe I've been waiting for
someone like you
to break down this sheltered heart
