THE HOOTERS - SATELLITE

Hush little baby don't cry like that
God's gonna buy you a Cadillac
He's chosen you to do his will
You can spread the word in your coupe de ville

Refrain:
So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And if you still can't see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite

Look to the heavens and see it shine
Heals the sick and leads the blind
Tune it in and hear it say 
It's counting down to judgement day

Refrain: ...

Hey satellite man your time has come
Your words received by everyone
And should you fall well that's OK
You love the ones that you betray

So jump in the river and learn to swim
God's gonna wash away all your sins
And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite

And when at last you see the light
God's gonna buy you a satellite
Hey, God's gonna buy you a satellite
Look to the heavens and see it shine
