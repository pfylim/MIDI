Singer : THE HOUSE BAND 
Title  : DANCING SHOES

(Words & music: P. Smid/H. Hardholt)

If the way you move
Don't make a groove
Hey woman, it's all right
We got this very thing
And it makes you wanna sing
And get you through the night

Dancin', put on your dancin' shoes
And keep on dancing
Dancin', put on your dancin' shoes
And keep on dancing

The way you jive
Got me hypnotized, do it all
Don't be wonderin'
If you can shake that thing
Sugar, let me take you to the ball

Dancin', put on your dancin' shoes
And keep on dancing
Dancin', put on your dancin' shoes
And keep on dancing

Don't be down and out
We're gonna make you scream and shout
Dig what I say
All you gotta do
Is do what's good for you
You'll be dancin' till your dying day

Dancin', put on your dancin' shoes
And keep on dancin'
You gotta keep on dancin', baby
You gotta keep on dancin'
