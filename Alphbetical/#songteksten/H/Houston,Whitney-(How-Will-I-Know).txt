WHITNEY HOUSTON - HOW WILL I KNOW

There's a boy, I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into, my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, hmm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, a-ha
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love

Hooh, how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (life could be deceiving)
How will I know

How will I know, if he really loves me
I say a prayer, with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know, if he's thinking of me
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (asking??)
Falling in love, is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak

Oh wake me, I'm shaking
I wish I had you near me now, a-ha
Say that no mistaken, what I feel is really love

Ooh tell me, how will I know (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know
How will I know (life could be deceiving)
How will I know

How will I know, if he really loves me
I say a prayer, with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you, 'cause you know about these things

How will I know, if he's thinking of me
I try to phone, but I'm too shy (asking??)
Falling in love, is all bitter sweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak

If he loves me, if he loves me not, mmm
If he loves me, ooh, if he loves me not, yeahea
If he loves me, if he loves me not, oh
How will I know
Ooh how will I know
How will I know
Hey, how will I know, hooh

How will I know, if he really loves me
