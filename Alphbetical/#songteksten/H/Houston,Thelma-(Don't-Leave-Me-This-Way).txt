Title  : DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY

(Words & music: Kenny Gamble/Leon Huff)

Don't leave me this way
I can't survive
Can't stay alive
Without your love
Oh, baby don't leave me this way

I can't exist
I'll surely miss
Your tender kiss
Don't leave me this way, no

Baby, my heart is full with love and desire for you
Now come on down and do whatcha gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burnin' outta control
Come on satisfy the need in me
'Cause only your good lovin' can set me free
Can set me free

Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand
I'm at your command
Oh, baby please
Please don't leave me this way, no
No baby, don't leave me this way, no

I can't survive
Can't stay alive
Without your love
Oh, baby don't leave me this way

Baby, my heart is full with love and desire for you
So come on down and do whatcha gotta do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burnin' outta control
So come on satisfy the need in me
Only your good lovin' can set me free

I need your lovin' baby
Satisfy the need in me
Baby, don't leave me this way
