   Crazy for you       David Hasselhoff


You you can say hello to tenderness
I I can say goodbye to emptiness
We we will live in happiness
I I will write I love you in the sand
We we will wander hand in hand
Ev'rybody knows we love each other

Refrain

I'm crazy for you you're crazy for me
You and I belong together
Like the sand and sea
I'm crazy for you you're crazy for me
I will be forever crazy for you

You you have made a dream reality
I I can feel your love surrounding me
We we will be in extasy
You and I were msde for each other
You you will give me love I've never had
I I will never ever make you sad
We we will face the good and bad
Ev'rybody knows we love each other

Refrain

I'm crazy for you ...

You you can touch a rainbow in the sky
I I will feel as though I've learnt to fly
We we can kiss the past goodbye
You and I were made for each other
You you have found what you've been searching for
I I will never hurt you that's for sure
We we will care for evermore
Ev'rybody knows we love each other

Refrain

I'm crazy for you ... (2x)
