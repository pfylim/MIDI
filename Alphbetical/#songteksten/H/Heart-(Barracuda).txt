2. BARRACUDA - HEART

Intro: Guitar-Riff (+ Drums)

Vers 1:
So this ain't the end,  I saw you again - today
I had to turn my heart away
You smiled like the sun,  kisses for everyone - and tales
It never fails!
You lying so low in the weeds, I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now wouldn't you, Barracuda?

Bridge: Guitar-Riff

Vers 2:
Back over time, when we were all trying - for free
You met with porpoise and me - aha
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song - a name
Whisper game!
And if the real thing don't to the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Hoo - Barracuda!  Oh yeah!

Zwischenvers:
"Sell me, sell you" the porpoise said,
"dive down deep down, deeper than you!"
I think that you got the blues, too.
All that night and all the next,  swan without looking back,
made for the western pools - silly, silly fools!

Vers 3 (2. H"lfte Vers 2):
The real thing don't to the the trick
Know you better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ah, Barra-Barracuda!
