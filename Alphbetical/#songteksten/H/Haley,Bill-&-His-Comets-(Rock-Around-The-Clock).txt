  Rock Around The Clock - Billy Haley & The Comets

  
  One, two, three, four o' clock rock
  Five, six, seven o' clock rock,
  Eight o' clock rock
  Nine, ten, eleven o' clock rock
  Twelve o' clock rock, we're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  
  Put your glad rags on and join me, Hon, We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one, 
  We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad day light 
  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  
  When the clock strikes two and three and four, 
  if the band slows down, we'll yell for more,
  We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad day light 
  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  
  When the chimes ring five and six and seven,
  We'll berockin' up in seventh heav'n, 
  We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad day light 
  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  
  When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too, I'll be going strong and so will you,
  We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad day light 
  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  
  When the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off, then, start a rockin' around the clock again,
  We're gonna rock around the clock tonight.
  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad day light 
  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight.
