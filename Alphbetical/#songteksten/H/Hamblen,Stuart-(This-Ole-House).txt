This ole house once knew his children;
this ole house once knew his wife.
Tihs ole house was home and comfort
as they fought the storms od life.
This ole house once rang with laughter;
this ole house heard many shouts,
Now he trembles in the darkness when the
lightnin' walks about.

Ain't a gonna need this house no longer;
ain't a gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles:
ain't got time ti fix the floor.
Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to
mend no window panes.
Ain't gonna need this house no longer;
He's agettin' ready to meet his fate.

This ole house is agettin' shaky;
this ole house is agettin' old,
this ole house lets in the rain,
this ole house lets in the cold.
Oh his knees are  agettin' chilly,
but he feels no fear nor pain,
'cause he seeks a new tomorrow 
through a golden window pain.

Ain't a gonna need this house no longer;
ain't a gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles:
ain't got time ti fix the floor.
Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to
mend no window panes.
Ain't gonna need this house no longer;
He's agettin' ready to meet his fate.

This ole house is afraid of thunder;
this ole house is afraid of storms.
This ole house just groans and trembles
when the night wind flings its arms.
This ole house is agettin' feeble;
this ole house is aneedin' paint,
just like him it's tuckered out,
He's agettin' ready to meet his fate.

Ain't a gonna need this house no longer;
ain't a gonna need this house no more.
Ain't got time to fix the shingles:
ain't got time ti fix the floor.
Ain't got time to oil the hinges nor to
mend no window panes.
Ain't gonna need this house no longer;
He's agettin' ready to meet his fate.
