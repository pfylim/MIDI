10. THOSE WERE THE DAYS - MARY HOPKIN

Intro (Auftakt + 5 Takte instrumental): 

Vers 1:
Once upon a time there was a tavern 
Where we used to raise a glass or two 
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Dreamed of all the great things we would do 

1.Refrain:
Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance  forever and a day ..
We'd live the life we chose, we'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way ...
Da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da da da-da  da-da-da-da da da-da da-da da

Bridge (2 Takte instrumental): 

Vers 2:
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way 
If by change I'd see you in the tavern 
We'd smile at one another and we'd say:

2.Refrain:
Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance  forever and a day
We'd live the life we chose, we'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days!
Da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da-da da da-da da-da da

Bridge (2 Takte instrumental):

Vers 3:
Just tonight I stood before the tavern (Kinderchor: La la la)
Nothing seemed the way it used to be (Kinderchor: La la la)
In the glass I saw a strange reflection (Kinderchor: La la la)
Was that lonely woman really me ? 

3.Refrain:
Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance  forever and a day
We'd live the life we chose, we'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes, those were the days!
Da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da-da da da-da da-da da
Da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da da da-da, da-da-da-da da da-da da-da da

Vers 4:
Through the door there came familiar laughter 
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser 
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

Those were the days, my friend,
