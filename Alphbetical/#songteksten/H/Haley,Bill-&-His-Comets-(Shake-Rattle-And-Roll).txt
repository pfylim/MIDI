  Get out from the kitchen and rattle those pots and pans,
  Well, roll my breakfast, 'cause I'm a hungry man.
  Shake, rattle and roll, Shake, rattle and roll
  Shake, rattle and roll, Shake, rattle and roll
  You never do nothin' to save your doggone soul.
  
  Wear in' those dresses, your hair done up so right
  Wear in' those dresses, your hair done up so right, 
  You look so warm, but your heart is cold as ice.
  I'm like a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store,
  I'm like a one-eyed cat, peepin' in a sea-food store,
  I can looked at you, tell you don't love me no more.
  I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know;
  The more I work, the faster my money goes.
