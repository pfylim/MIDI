Title  : DON'T PUSH IT DONT FORCE IT

(Words & music: Leon Haywood)

Mm, I'm ready, I'm ready now
Mm, I want you now ooh

Chorus:
Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen if it was meant to be
Don't push it, don't force it
Let it happen naturally
It will surely happen if it was meant to be

Patience given my best virtue
When I'm in the mood for love
I can't control my passion
I'm gonna love you all over

My nature's high, inside I'm burning
About to loose self-control
I can't fight this feeling
My love is much too hot to hold

Hee, la la la la la la
Hee, la la la la la la

If it was really meant to be, (don't push it)
It will happen naturally, (don't force it)
What will be will surely be, (don't push it)
If love was meant for you and me, (don't force it)

You're the spark that lights my fire
You set me on to fool along
I can't stand anticipation
I'm in the mood to get it on

Chorus: ...

I love you baby
I love you baby
