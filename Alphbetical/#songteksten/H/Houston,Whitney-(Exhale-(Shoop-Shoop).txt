Everyone falls 
In love sometime
Sometimes it's wrong
And sometimes it's right
For every win
Someone must fail
There comes a point when 
When we exhale yeah, yeah, say-

Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoo be doop  
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoo be
All you gotta do is say
Shoo be doop 
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop 
My love now shoop, shoo be doop 

Sometimes you laugh
Sometimes you`ll cry
Life never tells us
The whens or whys
When you've got friends
To wish you well
You'll find a point when
You will exhale yeah, yeah, say

Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoo be doop  
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoo be
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Say shoop be
Say shoop be
Say shoop be
Say shoop hoo
Say shoop be
Shoop be doop

Oh, hearts are often broken
When there are words unspoken
In your soul there`s answers to your prayers
If you're searching for
A place you know
A familliar face
Somewhere to go
You should look inside your soul
You're halfway there

Sometimes you laugh
Sometimes you cry
Life never tells us
The whens or whys
But when you've got friends
To wish you well
You'll find your point when you will exhale
Say

Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoo be doop  
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoo be
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop
Shoop, shoop, shoo be doop  
Shoop, feels alright
You can say, oh
Shoop be doop
