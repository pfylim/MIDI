It felt like spring time on this February morning
In the courtyard birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel alright
I carried them with me today now.

As I lay down to sleep 
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

I wonder why I feel so high
Thogh I'm not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Till you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I'll run to meet you
Barefoot barely breathing

As I lay down to sleep 
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I'll whisper your name into the sky
And I will wake up happy

It's not too near for me
Like a flower I need the rain
Though it's not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
when the sun comes out again.

Falling Falling
Into the river of my soul for me to know
I am floating on this current somewhere where
Love abounds
Distant calling
The sun goes down the beast start home say
Come along
I ain't about to shake off this sweet water it's warm.

Oh baby you weren't wrong
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff
That keeps me hanging on
My home is in your jungle
With your sky so blue
Those monkeys gave us much to love
You copy me I'll copy you

Kissing kissing
Beneath the trees we know so well
If they could tell
Of generations
Hugging hugging
And rubbing go much slower
As you get slower
I don't want to miss on one sensation

Oh baby you weren't wrong
I swing from limb to limb but it's your stuff
That keeps me hanging on
My home is in your jungle
With your sky so blue
Those monkeys gave us much to love
You copy me I'll copy you

Babe it's alright
I can swing on everything as long as when I come you hold me tight
My home is in your jungle
With your sky so blue
Those monkey left us much to learn
You show me how I'll show you too.
