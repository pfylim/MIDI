Title  : I DON'T WANNA DIE IN AN AIRDISASTER

The engine spit our fire, I'm pushed back in my chair
The pressure gives me thrills as we climb in the air
And I love to watch the clouds
And the mountains and the sky
Swish around the cocktail the stewardess brings by

Lord this is the life for me
Lord oh Lord this is the life for me
And I don't wanna die in an airdisaster
I don't wanna die on a plane

Well I fishtailed through the lanes
And I make my ties squeal
Power at my feet and gory at the wheel
And I wind the windows down
Let the wind blow through my hair
God knows where I'm going but me I don't care

Lord this is the life for me
Lord oh Lord this is the life for me
But I don't wanna die in a freeway pile up
I don't wanna die on the road

Well I'm young and I'm pretty
And I wanna stay that way
Wanna be desirable till my dying day
I don't wanna be bad ridden an old bitter sage
Have nurses saying I'm young for my age
(He's young for his age)

Oh Lord, don't let me go that way
Lord oh Lord, don't let me go that way
No don't let me go like a fading chorus
Don't make me fade like a song
Oh Lord have mercy on your son
Lord oh Lord, have mercy on me
'Cause I don't wanna die in an airdisaster
And I don't wanna die in a freeway pile up
And I don't wanna go like a fading chorus
And I don't wanna die for no good reason
And I just wanna go on and on
