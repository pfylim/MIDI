Title  : RICH GIRL

(Words & music: Daryl Hall)

Refrain:
You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl, but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money, money won't get you too far
Get you too far

Don't you know
Don't you know
That it's wrong
To take what he's given you
So far gone, on your own
But you could get along
If you tried to be strong
But you'll never be strong, 'cause

Refrain: ...

High and dry out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others
When you can't feel pain
Don't you know that a love can't grow
But it's too much to give
'Cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all

Refrain: ...
