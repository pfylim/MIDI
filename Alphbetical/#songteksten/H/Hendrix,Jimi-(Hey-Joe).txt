Hey Joe
Where are you going with that gun of yours?
Hey Joe
I said, where are you going with that gun in your hand?
Oh.

I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know I caught her
Messing around with another man.

I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know I caught her
Messing around with another man
That ain't too cool.

Hey Joe
I heard you shot your woman down
Shot her down down
Hey Joe
I heard you shot your lady down
Shot her down on the ground.

Yes, I did
I shot her
You know I caught her messing around
Messing around town.

Yes, I did
I shot her
You know I caught my old lady
Messing around town
And I gave her the gun
I shot her.

Oh right
You shoot her one more time again
Yeah, I did
All right.

Hey Joe
Where are you going to run to now?
Where are you going to run to?
Hey Joe
Where are you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?

I'm going way down South
Way down to Mexico way
All right
I'm going way down South
Way down, where I can feel free
Ain't  too much in the past
There ain't no hangman gonna
Ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe me right now
I got to go now.
...
Hey hey Joe 
You'd better run all the way down
Good-bye everybody.
