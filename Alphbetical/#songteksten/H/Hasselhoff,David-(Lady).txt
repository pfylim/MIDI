Lady you're an angel
falling from the stars
lady love is waiting
right here in my arms
lady lie beside me
love me tonight
two hearts found each other
one love can make it right
yes, two hearts are bound forever
my lady, my love
--------------------------------------------------------
Lady I'll be with you
every night and day
lady I was lonely
now you're here to stay
lady lie beside me
love me tonight
two hearts found each other
one love can make it right
yes, two heart are bound forever
my lady, my love
