                          SONG OF THE NIGHT

     As performed by: David Hasselhof

     The light of day is fading,..you're asleep beside me...
     I'd give my life if you..would stay.....
     but this is where you leave me..and close the door behind you,..
     upon the secret of your day.....

     Song of the night,..I'm facing a night of loneliness,.....
     song of the night,..I'm lost in the emptiness.....
     we never share your midnight melody,.....
     'cause you're with another man instead of me.....

     Song of the night,..oh help me to fight..what lies ahead.....
     I stand in my room and I look at an empty bed.....
     I need her, I want her, I just can't take it
     oh what would I give..if you could make it..be alright..
     song of the night.....

     SHORT BRIDGE...............

     I will see you tomorrow,..for one stolen moment,..
     I'll be at peace, a part of you.....
     magic moments together,..then the spell is broken...
     I'm in a dream..that can't come true.....

     Song of the night,..I'm facing a night of loneliness,.....
     song of the night,..I'm lost in the emptiness.....
     we never share your midnight melody,.....
     'cause you're with another man instead of me.....

     Song of the night,..oh help me to fight..what lies ahead.....
     I stand in my room and I look at an empty bed.....
     I need her, I want her, I just can't take it
     oh what would I give..if you could make it..be alright..
     song of the lonely night.....

     I need her, I want her, I just can't take it
     oh what would I give..if you could make it..be alright..
     song of the night.....

     Song of the night,..I'm facing a night of loneliness,.....
     song of the night,..I'm lost in your emptiness.....
     we never share your midnight melody,.....
