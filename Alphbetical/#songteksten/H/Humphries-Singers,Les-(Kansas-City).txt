Title  : KANSAS CITY

Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City
Kansas City with a friend of mine
We loved the woman and we had a good time
Then the trouble started with a gun
Kansas City with a friend of mine drank some whiskey
And we really felt fine
Then we started leaving on the run
Hey, ho yippee ja jay
He shot up Kansas City on a very fine day

Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City
Kansas City with a friend of mine
We loved for a dollar and we drank for a dime
Now I'm heading down to Santa Fe
Kansas City with a friend of mine
We came too late cut it mighty fine
Texas seemed to be the safest place to be
Hey, ho yippee ja jay
He shot up Kansas City on a very fine day

Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City
Kansas City with a friend of mine
It started rainin' turned the mud to slime
Now I'm headin' straight through Tennessee
Kansas City with a friend of mine
Now I'm headin' straight down the line
Nothin' more in Kansas left for me
Hay ho yippee ja jay he shot up Kansas City
On a very fine day
Kansas City, Kansas City, Kansas City
