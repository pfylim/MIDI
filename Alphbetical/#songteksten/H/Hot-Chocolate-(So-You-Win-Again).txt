Singer : HOT CHOCOLATE 
Title  : SO YOU WIN AGAIN

(Words & music: Russ Ballard)

Just to admit one mistake
That can be hard to take
I know we've made them fall
But only fools come back for more
Being the fool I am
I figured in you plans, darling
Your perfumed letters didn't say
You'd be leaving any day

Refrain:
So you win again, you win again
Here I stand again, the loser
And just for fun, you take my love and run
But love had just begun
I can't refuse her
And now I know that I'm the fool
Who won your love
To loose it all
When you come back
You'll win again (doo doo doo doo)
You'll win again (doo doo doo doo)

And I'm not proud to say
I let love slip away
Now I'm the one who's crying
I'm the clown there's no denying
When will the heartache end?
Will my whole life depend
On fading memories
You took the game this time with ease

Refrain: ...
