      Some  people say a man is made out of mud

      A poor man's made out of muscle and blood

      Muscle and blood and skin and bones

      A mind that is weak and a back that's strong

      
      You load sixteen tons, what do you get

      Another day older and deeper in debt

      Saint Peter don't you call me, cause I can't go

      I owe my soul to the company store


      I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine

      I picked up my shovel and walked to the mine

      I load sixteen ton, a number nine coal

      And the stalboss said well bless my soul

      You load sixteen tons...........enz.

    
      I was born one morning it was drizzle and rain

      Fightin and trouble are my middle name

      I was raised in a canebreak by an old mamalion

      Can call a hot tone woman make me hop the line

      You load sixteen tons.............enz

    
      If you see me coming better step aside

      A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died

      One fist of iron , the other of steel

      If the right one don't get you, then the left one will

      You load sixteen tons.............enz.
