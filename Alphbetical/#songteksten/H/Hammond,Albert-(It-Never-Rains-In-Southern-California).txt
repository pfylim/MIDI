Got on board a westbound.
Seven fourty seven.
Didn't think before deciding what to do.
All that talk of opportunities, T. V.
breaks and movies rang true, sure rang true.

Seems it never rains in Southern California.
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before.
It never rains in Southern California,
But girl don't they warn 'ya,
it pours, man it pours.

Out of work, I'm out a' my head,
out of selfrespect, I'm out a' bread
I'm under loved, I'm under fed, I wanna go home.

It never rains in Southern California,
But girl don't they warn 'ya,
it pours, man it pours.
