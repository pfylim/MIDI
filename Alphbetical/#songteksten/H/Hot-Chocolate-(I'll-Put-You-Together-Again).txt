Title  : I'LL PUT YOU TOGETHER AGAIN

(Words & music: Geoff Stephens)

When you can't take anymore
When you find your life is over
Put down your tablets
And pick up your pen
And I'll put you together again

If your faith withers away
If God can't bring you no answer
Write me a letter
I'll read it and then
I'll put you together again

You put us together together again
You put us together again
Just write me a letter my friend
I'll put you together again

If there's no night anyway
And you've got no one to turn to
I'll read your alter with darkness and then
You put us together again

Drop me a few lines
Telling me when
I'll put you together again

When things looks hopeless
Just write me my friend and then
I'll put you together again

Spoken:
I raped a chick in Detroit
No one believes I shot Bobby
I'll have a breakdown and
What happens then
I'll put you together again
She'll put us together again
She'll put us together again
