
    Please release me   Engelbert                      


Please release me, let me go
for I don't love you anymore
to waste  our lives would be a sin
release me and let me love again

I have found a new Ideal
and I will always want her near
her lips are warm while you're so cold
release me, my darling, let me go

Please release me, let me go
for I don't love you anymore
to waste  our lives would be a sin
release me and let me love again

Please release me, can't you see
you'd be a fool  to claim to me
to let a live would bring a spell
release me, and let me love again
love again, love again
