  Born To Be Alive - Patrick Hernandez

  
  We were born to be alive
  We were born to be alive
  Born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  
  People ask me why i never find a place to stop
  And settle down down down
  But i never wanted all the things
  People needed just to find their lives lives lives
  You see we're born born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  It's good to be alive to be alive
  To be alive
  It's good to be alive to be alive
  To be alive
  
  It's good to be alive
  Time was on my side when i was running down the street
  It was the bye bye bye
  A suitcase and an old guitar and something new
  To occupy my mind mind mind
  
  You see we're born born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  You see we're born born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  
  You see we're born born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  Born born to be alive (born to be alive)
  
  You see we're born born born (born to be alive)
  Born born to be alive.
  Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
  
  I couldn't get enough
  So i had to self - destruct
  The heat was on
  Rising to the top
  Everybody going strong
  That was when this party got hot
  I heard somebody say (born baby)
