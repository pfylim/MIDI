Well, my skinnie minnie has a clay as a cheek
And I was 6 feet high and one foot thin
And now I do I love her, does a boy love pie?
Well now and she has the eye pull over my eye
Skinnie Minnie she's skinnie
She ain't tall, that's all

Well Although her shadow doesn't take much ground
Well now what there is, that really gets her around
And now what are there ahead, there's a lot she'd be
And now and she may not weight too much for me
Skinnie Minnie she's skinnie
She ain't tall, that's all

Well now it's hard being slimmer than a fishing pole
She (has) one hair blond and the other hair brown

And now I did the other cheek from the other side
And now I found the old yard where did she hide
ah, Skinnie Minnie she's skinnie
She ain't tall, that's all
