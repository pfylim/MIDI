Forget your troubles and your aggravations
we're gonna have ourselves a celebration
forget your worries and any sorrow
we're gonna dance like there is no-no tomorrow
Whatever the hang up
we're getting a gang up
and we are gonna have us some fun
--------------------------------------------------------
I-it you're worried and fu-ull of trouble
come on do-own and it will pop like a bubble
i-if your problems are caused by heartbreak
come and join us you'll forget all your heartache
whatever the hang up
we're geting a gang up
and we are gonna have us some sun
--------------------------------------------------------
   Is everybody happy
   we're gonna have some fun
   is everybody happy
   well everybody have a lotta
   everybody have a lotta fun
--------------------------------------------------------
If you're surrounded by clouds of thunder
don't let it get ya and pull-off you under
you gotta fight and learn your lesson
or you will end up in deep deep depression
whatever the hang up
we're getting a gang up
and we are gonna have us some fun
