I am the one and only
Call me, call me by my name
Or call me by my number,
You put me trough it,
I'll still be doingt it
The way I do it.
And yet yout try to make me
Forget who I really am
Don't tell me, I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest.
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
They can't take that
Away from me I've been
The player in their crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more
In a million faces
High hopes and aspirations
Ideas above my station
Maybe but all this time
I've tried
To walk with dignity and
Pride.I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
They can't take that
Away from me
I can't wear this uniform
Without some compromises
Because you'll find out
We come in different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only, you
I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
They can't take that
Away from me
