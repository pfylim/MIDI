NANA MOUSKOURI - ONLY LOVE

Only love, can make a memory
Only love, can make a moment last
You were there and all the world was young
And all it's song unsung
And I remember you when love was all
All you were living for
And how you gave that love to me
Only then I felt my heart was free
I was a part of you and you were all of me
Warm were the days and the nights of those years

Painted in colors to outshine the sun
All of the world And the dreams and the tears
Live in remembrance
Only love, can make a memory
Only love, can make that moment last
Life was new
There was a rage to live
Each day a page to live
And I remember you then when love was all
All you were living for
And how you gave that love to me
Only then I knew my heart was free
I was a part of you and you were all of me
