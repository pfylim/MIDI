One look in your innocent eyes
and I knew you had to be the one
you walked out of all of my dreams
never thought the day would really come
I've been standing in a long desperate line
waiting for somebody like you
I may only be wasting my time
don't know what else to do

If you turn me away
just be careful what you say
girl, you've got my heart on the line
don't be mean, don't be cruel
don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line

It's too late to be wishing I was
in somebody else's shoes this time
I'm tired up, like a slave to a chain
praying that you'll please be kind
if it's true that love's a disease
baby, I'm a dangerous case
I beg for mercy, got me down on my knees
you've got a smile on your face

If you turn me away
just be careful what you say
girl, you've got my heart on the line
don't be mean, don't be cruel
don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line

I don't want to stay
in my own little world
so if you want to play
won't you show me, little girl

If you turn me away
just be careful what you say
girl, you've got my heart on the line
don't be mean, don't be cruel
don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line

If you turn me away
just be careful what you say
girl, you've got my heart on the line
don't be mean, don't be cruel
don't you treat me like a fool
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
Girl, you've got my heart on the line
