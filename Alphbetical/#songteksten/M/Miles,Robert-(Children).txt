CHILDREN - ROBERT MILES


Hold on take your life
Hold on to each reality
They seems so far
From you
But really they're close to you
You've got to break each
Precious dream
Until it breaks your heart in two
Build your life
Until you find
What's right for you

Children I know
You deserve more than this
World could ever give

Don't let them take it all
'Cause you know
They're going to take it all
They seem so far
From you
But really they're close to you
You've got to break each
Precious rule
Until it breaks your heart in two
Build your life
Until you find
What's right for you

Children I know
You deserve more than this
World could ever give

Long live the new flesh!
