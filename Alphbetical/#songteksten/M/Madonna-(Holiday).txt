Title  : Holiday
Singer : Madonna


Holiday celebrate, holiday celebrate
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be it would be so nice

Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world, in every nation
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together
To release the pressure
We need a holiday

Chorus:
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
(Come on let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (holiday)
If would be it would be so nice

You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your trouble down
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine and we will find
A way to come together
And make things better
We need a holiday

Chorus

Holiday, ooh yeah ooh yeah, celebrate
Come on let's celebrate
Holiday just one day out of life
Celebrate it would be so nice
Holiday celebrate (2x)
Holiday we've got to get together
Holiday just one day out of life
Celebrate it would be a celebration
