
12 WILD WOMAN - MICHAEL LEARNS TO ROCK

CAN I ACT LIKE AN ANGEL
IF I LIVE LIKE A JERK
CAN I KEEP ON DISGUISING
CAN I MAKE BELIVE
THAT I DON'T DECEIVE
NO...NO...NO...

CHORUS:
SEND THE WILD WOMAN OUT OF THE BACKDOOR
MY WIFE IS KNOCKING AT THE FRONTDOOR
THEY MADE ME A WINNER THEY MADE ME A SINNER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
DIRTY MONEY IN THE LEFT HAND
WHILE THE PREACHER'S SHAKING MY RIGHT HAND
THEY MADE ME A WINNER THEY MADE ME A SINNER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

WHEN I'M READING ON TOP OF
THE WAVE OF SUCCESS
WILL I LOSE MY DEVOTION
WILL I FAIL TO SEE
WHAT I USED TO BE
OH...OH...OH...

CHORUS:
SEND THE WILD WOMAN OUT OF THE BACKDOOR
MY WIFE IS KNOCKING AT THE FRONT DOOR
THEY MADE ME A WINNER THEY MADE ME A SINNER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
DIRTY MONEY IN THE LEFT HAND
WHILE THE PREACHER'S SHAKING MY RIGHT HAND
THEY MADE ME A WINNER THEY MADE ME A SINNER
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO

I'LL HAVE TO CARRY ON
AS TWO PERSONS IN ONE
