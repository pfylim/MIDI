BOBBY McFERRIN - DON'T WORRY, BE HAPPY

(Words & music: Bobby McFerrin)

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
Every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord says the rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy
Look at me I'm happy
Don't worry, be happy

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
Don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
That will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it
Be happy with a smile on your face
Don't bring everybody down like this
Don't worry it will soon pass whatever it is
Don't worry, be happy
I'm not worried
