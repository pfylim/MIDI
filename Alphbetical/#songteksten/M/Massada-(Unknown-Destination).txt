Title  : UNKNOWN DESTINATION

(Words & music: Zeth Mustamu/Massada)

Chorus:
People, who's made this situation
People, where's our destination
Watcha gonna do now?
Watcha gonna do now?
Watcha gonna do now?
Watcha gonna do now?

Yes I know we've been wrong
Let's try it every time
The force of two is strong
For you, for us, no more crime
Let's try to talk it over
What's happened to our love
We can better change our minds
For the good things in this life

Chorus: ...

Now it's time to explain
Why we simply can't love you all
The efforts made were in vain
Together we made a deep fall
We lost our way in a fight
Let's give us a helping hand
We can't sleep neither day nor night
'Cause we're strangers, in this land

Chorus: ...

People, who wants an unknown destination
People, you don't need it, I don't need it
We don't need it
People, where's the good vibration?
Watcha gonna do now?
