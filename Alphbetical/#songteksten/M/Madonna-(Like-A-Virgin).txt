      Like A Virgin          Madonna                                                 
                        
            
I made it through the wilderness, somehow I made it through.
Didn't know how lost I was until I foun you.
I was beat incomplete, I'd been had, I was sad and blue,
But you made me feel, yeah, you made me feel shiny and new.

Like a virgin touched for the very first time,
Like a virgin when you heart beats next to mine.
Gonna give you all my love, boy, my fear is fading fast,
Been saving it all for you 'cause only love can last.

You're so fine and you're mine, make me strong, yeah, you make me bold.
Oh, your love thawed, yeah, your love thawed out,
What was scared and cold.

Like a virgin, hey, touched for the very first time,
Like a virgin with your heartbeat next to mine.

You're so fine and you're mine, I'll be yours 'till the end of time,
'Cause you made me feel, yeah, you made me feel, I've nothing to hide.

Like a virgin, hey, touched for the very first time,
Like a virgin with your heartbeat next to mine.
Like a virgin, ooh, ooh, like a virgin, feels so good inside,
When you hold me and your heart beats and you love me.             
Ooh, baby, yeah, can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time ?
