Artist : MADNESS

(Words & music: Barson/Thompson)

Received a letter just the other day
don't seem they want to know you no more
They've laid it down, given you their score
Within the first two lines it blunty read

You're not to come see us no more
Keep away from our door
Don't come round here no more
What on earth did you do that for?

Our aunt she don't want to know, she says
What will the neighbours think, they'll think
She's the one that taught her everything
But now I'm not so sure I know anything

Our uncle he don't want to know, he says
We are disgraced for the human race, he says
How can you show your face
You're a disgrace to the  human race

They've made a commitment, you're an embarrassment
Yes an embarrassment, a living endorsement
The intention that you have booked
Was an intention that was overlooked

They say stay away
Don't want you home today
Keep away from their door
Don't want to see you no more

Our dad he don't want to know, he says
This is a serious matter
Too late to reconsider
Now no one's gonna wanna know ya

Our mum she don't want to know, she says
I'm feeling twice as old, she says
Thought she had a head on her shoulders
I'm feeling twice as older
I'm feeling twice as older

You're an embarrassment
