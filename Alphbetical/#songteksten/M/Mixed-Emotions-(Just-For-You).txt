                        Just for you


I was not the kind a guy
to sit and dream I knew the facts of life
just hated philosophy and reconed reality was the game for me.
Now you've turned my head around into the light
my feet have left the ground
here is how here and now gonna show all my love.

And it's just for you I'll try to fish up the ocean
just for you I'll try to color the stars.
And it's just for you I'll try to water the desert
just to make our flowers grow.
And it's just for you I'm slowing down the rotation
just for you I'll stop the earth and I'll try
because of you and we are so in love.

I think how it used to be 
and how it seemed I was so big and free
how did I not realize all the things I despised were so good for me.
Now I just can fly away
into your arms and know'n I'm gonna stay
here is how here and now gonna show you all my love.

I will be forever near
to lend a hand so darling never fear
if you are walking so tall or if you stumble and fall I'll be holding you.
Life will never be the same
because of you good bye to lonely pain
here is how here is now gonna show all my love.

ove is like a river, running to the seashore,
flowing on through night and day.
Get you lovin' flowing, I get my lovin' showing,
I, I love you.
