           Everybody loves somebody 


Everybody loves somebody sometime,
ev'rybody falls in love somehow.
Something in your kiss just told me,
my sometime is now.

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for ev'ry girl to have your charms
Then ev'ry minute, ev'ry hour
Ev'ry boy would find what I found in your arms.
Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was over due,
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you.

Everybody finds somebody someplace,
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
My someplace is hear.

If I had it in my power ...
