Title  : ROMEO

(Words & music: Dickens/E. Carter)

I am the morning you are the light
You make the morning such a beautiful thing
I am the green grass and you are the rain
Fall on me make me grow, no one will ever know
Fall on me make me grow again

I am the spirit you are the live
You make the sunshine brighter you make me smile
I am the water and you are the rose
Oh lady of the land come to me take my hand
Until tomorrow I'm your man

I am the darkness you are the night
You make the darkness such a beautiful thing
I am the mountain and you are the snow
Fall on me make me grow, no one will ever know
Fall on me make me grow again

Step back inside me Romeo she said
Step back inside me take me to your bed
Step back inside me Romeo
My Julietta take me home

My Julietta take me
Step back inside me Romeo she said
Step back inside me now
Step back inside me Romeo she said
Step back inside me take me to your bed
Step back inside me Romeo
My Julietta take me
