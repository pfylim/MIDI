                True Blue                    Madonna 


I've had other guys , I've looked into their eyes ,
But I never knew love before 'til you walked 'through my door .
I've had other lips , I've sailed a thousand ships ,
But no matter where I go , you're the one for me , baby ,
This I know 'cause it's .

True love ,
You're the one I'm dreaming of , your heart fits me like a glove ,
And I'm gonna be true blue , baby I love you.

I've heard all the lines , I've cried oh , so many times ,
Those teardrops they won't fall again ,
I'm so excited 'cause your're my best friend .

So if you should ever doubt , wonder what love is all about ,
Just think back and remember , dear , those words whispered in your ear.

I said - True love - ...
'Cause it's - True love - ...

No more sadness , I kiss it good-bye ,
The sun is bursting right out of the sky ,
I searched the whole world for someone like you ,
Don't you know , don't you know that it's .

True love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love.
True love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love.

So if you should ever doubt , wonder what love is all about ,
No more sadness , I kiss it good-bye .
True love - ...

I love you , this time I know it's true love ,
You're the one I'm dreaming of , love is just like a glove ,
True blue , baby I love you , 'cause it's ,

True love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love,oh baby , true love,
True love,oh baby,true love,oh baby,true love,oh baby , true love.
