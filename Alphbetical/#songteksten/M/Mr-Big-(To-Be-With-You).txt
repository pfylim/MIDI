     As performed by: Mr. Big     1991                                     


     Hold o-on little gir-irl,..show me what he's done to you..
     Stand up little gir-irl,..a broken heart can't be that bad.
     When it's throu-ou-ough..it's throu-ough,.. 
     fate will twist the both of you-ou.
     so come on baby,..come on over,..let me be the one to show you..

     I'm the one who wants to..be with you-ou-ou...
     Deep inside I hope you fee-eel it too (feel it too-oo)
     Waited on a line of (waited on a li--ine) greens and blues, 
     just to be the next to-o be with you...

     Build up your confidence..so you can be on top for once..
     Wake u-up! who cares about..little boys that talk too much.
     I seen it all..go dow-own,...your game of love was all rained out.
     So, come on baby, come on over, let me be the one to ho---old you-ou.

     I'm the one (I'm the o-one) who wants to be with you (yea-ea-eah!)
     Deep inside I hope you fee-eel it too (feel it too---oo)
     Waited on a line of (waited on a li--i-ine) greens and blues,
     (yeah) just to be the next to be-e with you.....

     Why be alone..when we can be together, baby?..
     You can make my life worthwhi-ile,..
     I can make you start to..smi---ile.

     SOLO.................................................................
     
     When it's throu-ou-ough..it's throu-ough,.. 
     an' fate will twist the both of you-ou-ou.
     so come on baby, come on over, let me be the one to sho-ow you..

     I'm the one who wants to be with you-ou-ou (I'm the o---o-one)
     Deep inside I hope you fee-eel it too (feel it too--oo hoo!)
     Waited on a line of (waited on a li--i-ine) greens and blues,
     (yeah) just to be the next to be-e with you.....

     I'm the one who wants to (I'm the o---o-o--o-one) be with you-ou-ou
     Deep inside I hope (deep insi-ide) you fee-eel it too
