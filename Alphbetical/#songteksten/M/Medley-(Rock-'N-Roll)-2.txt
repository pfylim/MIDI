They're really rockin' in Boston , and Pitsburgh P.A.
deep in the heart of Texas , and down in Frisco Bay
all over Saint Louis , and down in New Orleans
all the kids gonna dancin' , sweet little sixteen

Sweet little sixteen , she just got to have
about a half a million , famed autograph
her wall is filled with pictures , she gets them one by one
become so excited , what you're look at the run

They're really rockin' in Boston ...

See you later alligator , after a while crocodile
see you later alligator , after a while crocodile
Can't see you 're in my way now
don't you know you cramp my style ?

Well I saw my baby walking , with another man today                
Well I saw my baby walking , with another man today
when I asked her what's the matter
this is what I heared to say

Some people like to rock , some people like to roll
but moving and a grooving so let's have to find my soul
let's have a party , oooh , let's have a party
we're singing to the store let's have some more
let's have a party tonight

I never kissed a bear , I never kissed a guh
but I can shake a chicken in the middle of the room
let's have a party , oooh , let's have a party
We're singing to the store , let's have some more
let's have a party tonight

Some people like to rock ...

Hello Josephine , how do you do
do you remember me baby , like I remember you
you used to laugh at me , and how a boh boh boh

I used to walk you home , I used to hold your hand
you used to use my umbrella , every time in the rain
you used to cry so much , it was a crying shame ,

You used to live over yonder , by the railroad track
yhen it rained you couldn't walk , I used to tow you on my back
now you signed me to leave , it was a real pooh pooh .

Hello Josephine , how do you do
do you remember me baby , how I remember you
you used to laugh at me , and how a boh boh boh
you used to laugh at me , and how a boh boh boh
you used to laugh at me , and how a boh boh boh
