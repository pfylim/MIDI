Oooh
Sh sh sh sugar
Oo oo yeah
Is he alone
Waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous
I'm holding all the questions
His lips are dry
Your heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know
Exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body
And you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me
Just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Wow

Moses gave to his folks this plan
To escape from slavery

Take my hand

If you can
Come on, come on, come on, come on
