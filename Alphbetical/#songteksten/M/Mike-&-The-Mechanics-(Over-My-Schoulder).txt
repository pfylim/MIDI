Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eyes
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say good-bye.

Looking back over my shoulder
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish we were starting over
Oh, instead of drifting so far apart.

Everybody told me you were leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby please, tell me that I'm dreaming
I just never want to let you go.

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eyes
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say good-bye.

I don't mind everybody laughing
But it's enough to make a grown man cry
'Cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don't even know the reason why.

Everyday it's a losing battle
Just a smile and hold my head up high
Could it be that we belong together?
Baby, won't you give me one more try?
One more try.

Looking back oh over my shoulder
(I can see) See that look in your eyes
(I never dreamed) No, that it could be over
But I never wanted to say good-bye.

(Looking back) Looking back (over my shoulder)
Oh, with an aching (there's an aching) feeling inside
(Cutting me up) oh, deeper and deeper
(Fills me with a sadness)
I can't hide (I can't hide)
(Looking back...)
