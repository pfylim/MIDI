KYLIE MINOGUE - WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING

(Words & music: Stock/Aitken/Waterman)

I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change

Some people don't understand
What I see in you
If only they knew
Do they think
My head's in the sand
They'll never see
The best side of you

Is my heart ruling my mind
Maybe I'm not right every time
But I know I'm right
About this love of mine

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
There's no questioning in my heart
When it comes to our love
I wouldn't change a thing

Yes I had my doubts
My ups and downs
On the merry-go-round
They say my head's in the cloud
But I'm keeping one
Foot on the ground

I know they say love is blind
But he's the best thing
That happened to me
And I'm not ashamed
For the world to see

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
There's no questioning in my heart
When it comes to our love
I wouldn't change a thing

I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change
I-I-I I wouldn't change

Is my heart ruling my mind
Maybe I'm not right on everything
But I know that I'm so right about him

If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a single thing
There's no questioning in my heart
When it comes to our love
I wouldn't change a thing
