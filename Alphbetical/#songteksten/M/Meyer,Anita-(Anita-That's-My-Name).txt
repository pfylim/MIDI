Singer : ANITA MEYER 
Title  : ANITA, THAT'S MY NAME

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Never wondered who I was
My mama told me
I think my birthday
Was a sunny day
Back in October '54
My daddy showed me
And he decided that Anita was my name

When I was six
I did my first performance
Between the sliding doors
On granny's wedding day

Had no problem growing up
I just got older
And I accepted
That Anita is my name

Never wondered how to sing
And no one told me
'Cause I had to find out
Trying to sing a song
In '67 in Berlin
A stripper showed me
Far too much
But it didn't do me wrong

I wondered how she's done
Her first performance
Between the sliding doors
On granny's wedding day

Don't know why I tell you this
Nobody forced me
Just some stories about
Anita, that's my name

Never wondered how to love
Until he told me
Ooh, that feeling
Life would never be the same

Confusion made me feel
Like I was standing
Between the sliding doors
On granny's wedding day

And now I'm trying to live
The way life showed me
A brand new story
About Anita, that's my name
A brand new story
About Anita, that's my name
