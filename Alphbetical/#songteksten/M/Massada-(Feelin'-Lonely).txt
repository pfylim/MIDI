Title  : FEELIN' LONELY

(Words & music: Johnny Manuhutu)

I'm, feeling lonely
My mind is thinking only
Of the girl, my heart's been waiting for
But she don't need me anymore

When you're in love, well, it's hard to say
Can't you see her love was just for one day
Only a game like a child plays with toys
So listen, listen, listen, and make your own choice

I'm, I'm feeling sad today
Girl, why don't you, why don't you come my way?
Into my arms, that want to hold you so tight
And love you, love you, love you every day and night
Don't live too long in your fantasy
Please come back into life reality

Chorus:
You can make me feel better
Turn around and look at me now
My heart's in broken pieces
Girl, I want you anyhow

I feel so sad today
Girl, girl, whydon't you just come my way
Into my heart, it's longing for your touch
Life seems so empty 'cause I miss you so much
Don't live too long in your fantasy
Please come back into life reality

Chorus: ...
