     As performed by: Mamas Cass                                   


     And now to sing this lovely ballad,....here is..Mama Cass.....

     Stars shining, bright above you,...
     night breezes seem to whisper, I love you..
     birds singin' in the sycamore tree,...
     dream a little dream of me...

     Say nighty night an' kiss me... 
     jus' hold me tight an' tell me you'll miss me.. 
     while I'm alone an' blue as can be,..
     dream a little dream of me....

     Stars fading..but I linger on, dear,.. 
     still craving your ki---ss... 
     I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear,.. 
     just saying thi--i--s..

     Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you,...
     sweet dreams that leave our worries behind you.. 
     but in your dreams, whatever they be,..
     dream a little dream of me...(da-da-da..da-da-da)

     WESTERN PIANO SOLO...............................................

     Stars fading, but I li-i-inger on, dear.. 
     still craving your ki--ss... 
     I'm longing to linger 'til dawn, dear,.. 
     just saying thi---hi-hi-hi--is..

     Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you,..(woo hoo)
     sweet dreams that leave our worries..fa-ar behind you.. 
     but in your dreams, whatever they be-e--,..
     dream a little drea-eam of me..

     Da-da-da-da..da-da---da--...da---da-da..da-da-da-da-da--..
     da-da-da-da..da-da da-da-da-da..da-da-da-da--...
