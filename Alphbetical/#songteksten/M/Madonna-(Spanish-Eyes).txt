Title  : Spanish Eyes
Singer : Madonna


I know for sure his heart is here with me
Though I wish him back I know he cannot see
My hands trembling
I know he hears me sing

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ he'll come tonight
And pray for Spanish eyes

And if I have nothing left to show but
Tears on my pillow
What kind of life is this if God exists
Then help me pray for Spanish eyes

He had to fight like all the rest
In the barrio all the streets are paved with fear
I don't understand, at least he was a man

I light this candle and watch it throw
Tears on my pillow
And if there is a Christ he'll come tonight
And pray for Spanish eyes

How many lives will they have to take
How much heartache
How many suns will they have to burn
Spanish eyes
When will they ever learn

You were not the Maravilla in our minds
We were proud to fight
But we cannot win this blind
Stand your arms against the wall
Who's next in line to fall


By Madonna and Patrick Leonard
