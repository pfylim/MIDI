Title  : PEACHES ON A TREE

You always keep a young girl warm, son
You have to hear what I say, son
You've to be nice as can be, son
'Cause that's the only right way, son

You always keep a smiling face, son
Don't try to do it so space, son
Try her nicely to embrace, son
'Cause that's the only right base, son

You never work all day and night, son
Someone has to hold her tight, son
Sure all those things you have to face, son
'Cause that's the only right base, son

Refrain:
That's what my father used to teach me
Never let another story reach me
You can't grow peaches on a tree
Meant for cherries you will see
And so forever it will be
Soft and tender as I say, son
You do the things in a perfect way, son
You can't grow peaches on a tree
Meant for cherries you will see
And so forever it will be (nanana..)
