GEORGE MICHAEL - CARELESS WHISPER

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand
And lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbyes

Refrain:
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though its easy to pretend
I know your not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you find

Refrain: ...

Never without your love
Tonight the music seems too loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

Refrain: ...

Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong so wrong
That you had to leave me alone
