Title  : WHEN YOU'RE GONE

I never had another lover
It was you who did discover
How to really touch my heart
Now you are telling me you're going
While my love for you is showing
We should never be apart
So please don't turn your back upon me
Without your love I'll die slowly
You have taken half my life
Every step I do for you love
Every move is born out of true love
It's a dream I won't survive
'Cause when you're gone
It's not of any use that I go on
That is understood
Don't leave me alone
The stars won't twinkle in the sky no more
The tree will lose it's bloom
The birds won't sing their song
When I take your hand
I feel, my love for you will never end or disappear
Please understand
I am here
Love is beautiful, love is near
When you're here
If you stay with me I promise
I will tell the world about us
I will sing your favorite song
I'll make you dream a dream for ever
Bring you flowers
Change the weather
I will prove my love is strong
But when you're gone
It's not of any use that I go on
That is understood
Don't leave me alone
The stars won't twinkle in the sky no more
The tree will lose it's bloom
The birds won't sing their song
