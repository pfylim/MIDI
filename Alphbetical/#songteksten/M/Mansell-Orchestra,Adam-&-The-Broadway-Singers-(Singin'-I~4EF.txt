11. SINGING IN THE RAIN - ADAM MANSELL ORCHESTRA & THE BROADWAY SINGERS

I'm singin' in the rain
just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ryone from the place 
C'mon with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain
I walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain
