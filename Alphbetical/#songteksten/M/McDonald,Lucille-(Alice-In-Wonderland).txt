Title  : ALICE IN WONDERLAND

(Words & music: P. Polpero/C. de Rijk)

I went to the movies 
With a child by my side
On a saturday afternoon
I looked in her eyes 
Saw the glance of surprise
(Do do do do do do)

We saw the white rabbit
With a watch round his neck
Who was trying to be on time
They laughed at the frogs
Who were jumping the rocks
(Do do do do do do)

Alice in wonderland
Look what you do
You take all the children
In this magic world of you

Standing in the light
Everything's alright
At the movies with you

Alice in wonderland
Look what you do
You take all the children
In this magic world of you

Alice in wonderland
Look what you do
You take all the children
In this magic world of you
