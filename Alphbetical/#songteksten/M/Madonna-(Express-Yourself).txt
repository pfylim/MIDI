Title  : Express Yourself
Singer : Madonna


Dont't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
You'll never come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Thenn you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic what happens 
  when you're not in bed
You deseve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own
Baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then You'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now
Make him show you how
Express what he's got
Oh baby ready or not

And when you're gone he might regrett it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on

But he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey
