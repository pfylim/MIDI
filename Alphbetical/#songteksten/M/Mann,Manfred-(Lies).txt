Title  : LIES
Artist : MANFRED MANN

(Words & music: O. Newman)

We're all gonna live out the Hollywood dream
Everything's gonna be just what it seems
Gonna find a better way to run our cars
All through the Eighties
'Cos the race is on we're gonna land on Mars
All through the Eighties
The video screan will open up the door
All through the Eighties
Information, there'll be more and more
All through the Eighties
Will the man on the street finally know the score

Chorus:
But I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
Where is my place in this bright future
I heard him say
I've lost my hope there isn't anywhere to play
(Pull up the trees and put up a parking lot)

The play's being written we'll all be in the cast
All through the Eighties
And our feet are gonna point away from the past
All through the Eighties
Will Supersonic travel be our ticket to ride
We'll have cruise missiles, they think as they fly

Chorus: ...

Time will go and the years fly by
All through the Eighties
And we'll have another slice of American Pie
All through the Eighties
Credit card living, push button cash
All through the Eighties
We'll pay our money and we'll take our trash
And another generation will 
Talk about their Generation

Chorus: ...

But I saw a kid with no smile on his face today
Where is my place in this bright future
I heard him say
