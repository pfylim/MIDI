Singer : MUD 
Title  : SHAKE IT DOWN

Won't you get up on your feet
Hear that music sounding sweet
You'll kind of like it (kind of like it)
Move your body around the floor
Can't you give it any more
Now don't you fight it (don't you fight it)
Shake it down, shake it down

Foxy lady over there
Bet she knows when and where
She can make it (she can make it)
If she gets closer to me
There's no place I'd rather be
No I can take it (I can take it)
Shake it down shake it down

Everybody's on the move
Tell me that you got to lose
Think about it (think about it)
Let the music turn you on
'Cause the night will soon be gone
Get down and shout it (down and shout it)
Shake it down, shake it down
Shake it down, shake it down
