  10. Rock 'n' Roll Medley
  
  Susy Baby, Deine Beine sind sch"n,
  Susy Baby, la  uns tanzen gehn,
  Deine blauen Augen schauen mich an.
  Aus diesem Grund sag ich zu Dir dann,
  ein Susy Rock find jeder nett,
  wenn die Susy tanzt aufm Tanzparkett
  und wenn auch ich mit dabei,
  oh du, du, Baby, eins, zwei, drei.
  
  Ein Susy Rock, Susy Rock, 
  oh Susy Rock, Susy Rock, 
  Su-Susy Rock,  berm Parkett, uns zwei.
  
  Rock it...
  
  Rock, Susy Baby, Susy Rock,
  rock, Susy Baby, Susy Rock...
  we're rocking all the night.
