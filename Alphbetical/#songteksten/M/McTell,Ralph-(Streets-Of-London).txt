Titel:         STREETS OF LONDON

Interpret:     RALPH McTELL



Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
kicking in the papers with his worn out shoes
in his eyes you see no pride hand held loosely by his side
yesterday's papers telling yesterday's news.
So how can you tell me you're lonely 
and say for you the sun don't shine.
Let me take you by the hand
and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.

Have you seen The old girl who walks the streets of London
dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags ?
She's no time for talkin', she just keeps right on walkin',
carrying her home in to carrier bags.

In the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven
same old man sitting there on his own.
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup.
Each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone.

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission,
memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears ?
In our winter city the rain cries a little pity
for one more forgotten hero and a world that doesn't care.

Someone's singing Lord, kumbajah
