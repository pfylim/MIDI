
STILL GOT THE BLUES - GARY MOORE

Used to be so easy to give my heart away
But I've found out the hard way
There's a price you have to pay
I've found out that love is no friend of mine
I should have known time after time
So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you.

Used to be so easy to fall in love again
But I've found out the hard way
That it's a road that leads to pain
I found out that love was more than just a game
You're playing to win but you'll lose just the same
So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you.

So many years since I've seen your face
But here in my heart there's an empty space
You used to be.

So long, it was so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you.

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you.
