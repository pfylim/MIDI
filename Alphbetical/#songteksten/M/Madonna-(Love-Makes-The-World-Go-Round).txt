Title  : Love Makes The World Go Round
Singer : Madonna


Make love not war we say
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight
But not with guns and knives
We've got to save the lives
Of every boy and girl that grows up in this world

Chorus:
There's hunger everywhere
We.ve git to take a stand
Reach out for someone's hand
Love makes makes the world go round
It's easy to forget, if you don't hear the sound
Of pain and prejudice
Love makes the world go round

They think that love's a lie
But we can teach them how to try
Love means to understand
Reach out for someone's hand
'Cause everything you do
Comes back in time to you
We have to change our fate
Before it gets too late

Chorus

Don't judge a man 'til you've been standin' in his shoes
You know that we're all so quick to look away
'Cause it's the easy thing to do
You know that what I say is true

Chorus

Make love not war
It's easy to recite
But it don't mean a damn
Unless we're gonna fight

Chorus

Starting now, reach out
