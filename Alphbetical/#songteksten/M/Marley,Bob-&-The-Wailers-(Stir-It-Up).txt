Title  : STIR IT UP

(Words & music: Bob Marley)

Chorus:
Ooh, stir it up
Little darling, stir it up
Come on and stir it up
Little darling, stir it up

It's been a long, long time
Since I've got you on my mind
And now you are here
I say it's so clear
See what we could do
Honey, just me and you

Chorus: ...

I spoke the words
I blessed your fire
Said I'd satisfy your, your heart desire
Said I'd stir it, yeah
Every minute, yeah
All you've got to do honey
Is keep it in hand

Chorus: ...

Ooh, would you quench me
While I'm thirsty
Ooh, would you cool me down
When I'm hot
You rested me darling
It's so tasty
And it sure can't stir you part, so

Chorus: ...
