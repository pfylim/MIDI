Title  : FEELINGS

Feelings nothing more than feelings
Trying to forget my feelings of love

Teardrops rolling down on my face
Trying to forget my feelings of love

Feelings for all my life I'll feel it
I wish I've never met you girl
You'll never come again
Feeling oh oh feeling
Feeling oh oh feeling
Feeling oh oh feeling
Again in my arms

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings I'll never have you
Again in my heart
