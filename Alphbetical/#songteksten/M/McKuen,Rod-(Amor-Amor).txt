Title  : AMOR, AMOR

(Words & music: Skylar/Mendez/Ruiz)

Amor, amor, amor
These words so sweet
That I repeat
Means I adore you
Amor, amor my love
Would you deny
This heart that I
Have placed before you

I can't find another word
With meaning so clear
My lips try to whisper
Sweeter things in you ear

But somehow or other
Nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing words I know
Amor, amor my love

When you're away
There is no today
And nights are lonely
Amor, amor, my love
Make you divine
Say you'll be mine
And love me only
