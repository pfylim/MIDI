Let me lay your head down, Sandy
Let me lay it down on me
Whenever you want me too
Let me hold your hand tight, Sandy
Let me hold it tight on me
Whenever you want me too

Ooh, ooh, I know that you don't believe me
(Don't believe me)
Ooh, I think I'll never get through

You can lay your head down, Sandy
You can lay it down on me
Whenever you want it too
Will you ever give me Sandy
Any chance to love you
As much as you want me too

Ooh, ooh, I know that you don't believe me
(Don't believe me)
Ooh, I think I'll never get through

'Cause I want to take you back
To the sidewalk
'Round the corner of the street
Help me make you find that feeling
With me
Lay your head down
Let me love you

Maybe you'll believe me
You're the only boy around
Maybe you'll believe me
You're the only boy around

Let me lay your head down, Sandy
Let me lay it down on me
Whenever you want me too
Let me hold your hand tight, Sandy
Let me hold it tight on me
Whenever you want me too

'Cause I want to take you back
To the sidewalk
'Round the corner of the street
Help me make you find that feeling
With me
Lay your head down
Let me love you

Maybe you'll believe me
You're the only boy around
Maybe you'll believe me
You're the only boy around

Will I ever see you, Sandy
Will I ever see you
Through the eyes you
You want me too
