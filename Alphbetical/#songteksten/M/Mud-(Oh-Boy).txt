Title  : OH BOY


All my love, all my kissin'
You don't know what you've been a missin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world will see
That you were meant for me

All my life, I've been a waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world will see
That you were meant for me

Stars appear, and the shadow is a fallin'
I can hear my honey callin'
A little bit of lovin' makes ev'rythin' right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All my life, I've been a waitin'
Tonight there'll be no hesitatin'
Oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, the world will see
That you were meant for me
