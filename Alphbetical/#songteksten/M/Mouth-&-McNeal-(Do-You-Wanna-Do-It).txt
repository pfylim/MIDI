Title  : DO YOU WANNA DO IT

Do you wanna do it
Do you wanna do it now do you
Do you wanna do it now do you
Are you tryin' to make me feel blue

Do you wanna do it
Do you wanna do it now do you
Tell me what it stands for that do it
There are so many things I would do

It's so hard to say it
Can't you guess the word that I mean

I still don't understand so can't you
Be a little more clear

I I I just wanted some of you love
But didn't dare to explain
So so so you wanted some of my love
You have it all on the brain
