Title  : ROCK ME UP A MOUNTAIN

(Words & music: Albert Hammond/Frannie Golde)

Chorus 1:
Rock me up a mountain
Roll me down a river
Spend me till I'm broke
And shower me with love

When I feel your heartbeat
Movin' to my rhythm
Then I know what makes my world go 'round

I just couldn't wait too long
No I never knew a love so strong could hold me
Callin' my name
Just the way that you do
Like the sun and the rain
Won't you color me a rainbow

Chorus 1: ...

Chorus 2:
You, you mean everything to me you do
Only you can carry me with you
I'm under your wing
And you're keeping me warm
While we're waiting for spring
Won't you color me a rainbow

Chorus 1: ...

Take away the sun, the rain, the vry air I breathe
I'd give it all for loving you
There is nothing I would need
You've made my life complete
You gave me all the love in you

Chorus 2: ...

Chorus 1: ...
