       SOME SAY LOVE, IT IS A RIVER

      THAT DROWNED THE TENDER REED

      SOME SAY LOVE, IT IS A RAZOR

      THAT LEADS YOUR SOUL TO BLEED

      SOME SAY LOVE, IT IS A HUNGER

      AN ENDLESS SAKING NEED

      I SAY LOVE, IT IS A FLOWER

      AND YOU IT'S ONLY SEED


      IT'S THE HEART, AFRAID OF BREAKING

      THAT NEVER LEARNS TO DANCE

      IT'S THE DREAM AFRAID OF WAKING

      THAT NEVER TAKES THE CHANCE

      IT'S THE ONE WHO WON'T BE TAKING

      WHO CAN NOT SEEM TO BEAR

      AND THE SOUL AFRAID OF DYING

      THAT NEVER LEARNS TO LIVE

      
      WHEN THE NIGHT HAS BEEN TOO LONELY
      AND THE ROAD HAS BEEN TOO LONG
      AND YOU THINK THAT LOVE IS ONLY
      FOR THE LUCKY AND THE STRONG
      JUST REMEMBER IN THE WINTER
      FOR BENEATH THE BITTER SNOWS
      LIFE'S THE SEED 
      THAT WITH THE SUN'S LOVE
      IN THE SPRING, BECOMES THE ROSE..................
