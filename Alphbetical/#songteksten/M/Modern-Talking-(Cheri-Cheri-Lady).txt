MODERN TALKING - CHERI CHERI LADY

Oh I cannot explain, every time it's the same
Oh I feel that it's real, take my heart
I've been lonely too long, oh I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance take my heart
I need you so, there's no time
I'll ever go

Refrain:
Cheri cheri lady, going through emotion
Love is where you find it, listen to your heart
Cheri cheri lady, livin' in devotion
It's always like the first time let me take apart
Cheri cheri lady, like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it, listen to your heart
Cheri cheri lady, to know you is to love you
If you call me baby, I'll be always yours

I'll get up, I'll get down, all my world turns around
Who is right, who is wrong, I don't know
I've got pain in my heart, got a love in my soul
Easy come but I think easy go
I need you so, all the times
I've move so slow
