
5. GIVE ME ALL YOUR LOVE - MAGIC AFFAIR

CHORUS:
GIVE ME ALL YOUR LOVE
I WANT EVERYTHING I CAN'T LET GO
GIVE ME ALL YOUR LOVE
IF YOU AIN'T MY FRIEND, YOU'LL BE MY FOE

QUESTION..., WHAT IS LOVE? ANSWER, THE SAME AS HATE
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
AND IT'S EVEN MORE DANGEROUS
WHEN MONEY IS INVOLVED
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK
WHEN A WOMAN ONLY SAYS: "I LOVE YOU"
IN AN EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT
OR WHEN THEY'RE GETTING A PRESENT
BUT NOT AT HOME BEHIND CLOSED DOORS
OR IN FRONT OF YOUR FRIENDS
PERSONALLY, THEY WOULD GET FIRED WITH NO PAYCHECK
BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME, BABY!

RAP1:
HOLD UP, HOLD UP, CHECK MY LINGUISTICS
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN TO YA! AFROLISTIC!
I AIN'T DOWN WITH THE LOVE STUFF KID
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, JET ON THE DOUBLE
SEE YA GOT A HABIT OF KEEPING THE BROTHER BROKE
I AIN'T THE ONE, WHY? CUZ I'M LOCKED
PACK YOUR BAGS, AND PUT DOWN THE PLATTER
YOU WANNA CHILL WITH ME CUZ MY POCKETS GOT FATTER
YOU WANT DIN-DIN, DRIVE A NEW BENZ THEN
SUCK ME DRY AND SPIT OUT AGAIN
ROMANCING, DANCIN' AND A FUR COAT
AH AH, I DON'T PLAY THESE JOKES
YOU CAN'T FADE ME, RUN ME THROUGH THE MAZE
I KNOW ABOUT WOMEN AND THE MYSTIC WAYS
AND IN MY CASH FLOW, YOU CAN'T STOP IT
GIVE UP THE PROPS TO THE UNDERGROUND PROPHET

CHORUS

RAP 2:
BACK AGAIN, I GUESS YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
OPEN YOUR EYES, HOMEGIRL, BECAUSE YOU'RE MISSING
THE SIMPLE FACT
THAT A BANK CAN GET YOU STUCK
CAUGHT BETWEEN THE WALL AND A MAC TRUCK
ALL FOR THE TAKING, NOT TO BE TOOK
1-8-7 ON THE POCKETBOOK
VIOLATIONS, GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION
MO'MONEY, MO'MONEY, IS WHAT I'M FACIN''
I PAID THE PRICE BEFORE, NOW I'M THROUGH WITH IT
DON'T EVEN FRONT ON ME
BECAUSE YOU DID IT
INSTEAD OF LOVE, IT'S A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
SO I BROKE ON OUT ON A NEW MISSION
IF YOU WOULD'VE BEEN STRAIGHT FROM THE GET GO
THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO LEAVE
THROUGH THE BACK DOOR
1 STRIKE IS WHAT YOU GET, LATER
SEE YA AND WOULDN'T WANNA BE YA!

CHORUS
