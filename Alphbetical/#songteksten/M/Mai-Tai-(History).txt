MAI TAI - HISTORY

Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me
Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me

Now listen people to what I have to say
I really love him but he just threw my heart away

Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me
Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me

When you're gonna fall in love, there's nothing
you can do about it
When you're gonna fall in love, don't you beat
around the bush
When you're gonna fall in love, now don't you
try to deny it
When you're gonna fall in love, better let it get
to you

Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me

Now it's over he's got a heart made out of stone
I've learned a lesson, the day I found myself alone

Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me
Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me

When you're gonna fall in love, there's nothing
you can do about it
When you're gonna fall in love, don't you beat
around the bush
When you're gonna fall in love, now don't you
try to deny it
When you're gonna fall in love, better let it get
to you

When it got to lovin' you were never there
All that I could do was dream
When I need some huggin' you never ever cared
Why did you have to be that mean

Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me
Our love is history, I'm gonna burn the letters
you were sending me
