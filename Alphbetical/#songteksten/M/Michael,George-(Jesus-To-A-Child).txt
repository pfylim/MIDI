
6. JESUS TO A CHILD - GEORGE MICHAEL

Kindness in your eyes,
I guess you heard me cry.
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child.

I‹m blessed
I know heaven said
Heaven store.
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child.

And what have I learned
From all this.
Hey, I thought I never
Feel the same about anyone.
Or anything again.
For now I know

Chorus:
When you find your love
When you know that it exists.
Then the lover that you miss
Will come to you 
On those cold, cold nights.
When you‹ve been loved
When you know 
It holds such bliss.
Then the lover that you kiss
Will comfort you.
When there‹s no hope inside.

Sadness in my eyes
No one guessed,
And no one tried
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child.

Loveless and cold.
With your last breath
You saved my soul.
You smiled at me
Like Jesus to a child.

And what have I learned
From all these tears
I‹ve waited for you 
All those years.
And just when it began,
You took your love away
But I still say.

Chorus:

So the words I could not say
I‹ll sing them for you.
And the love we would have made,
I‹ll make it for two.
For every single memory
Has become a part of me.

You will always be 
My love.

When I‹ve been loved
So I know just why love ends
And the lover that I kissed
Is always by my side.
Oh, the lover I still miss
Was Jesus to a child.
