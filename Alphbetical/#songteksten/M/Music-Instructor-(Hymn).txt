Ladies and gentleman
We would like to show you how to make a hit record
First we start with the sequenzer
And now we present a hihat
These are the percussion instruments
Now it`s time to welcome the bass drum
Let us now hear the sequenz melodie

Now it`s time to present the main vocals

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory to hail thy kingdom come

Listen how it sounds when we pitch them 5 notes up

Give us this day all that you showed me
The power and the glory to hail thy kingdom come
Give me all the stories you told me
The fame and the glory to hail thy kingdom come

And now enjoy the keyboard

Ladies and gentleman: A hit record

Give me all the stories you told me
The fame and the glory to hail thy kingdom come
