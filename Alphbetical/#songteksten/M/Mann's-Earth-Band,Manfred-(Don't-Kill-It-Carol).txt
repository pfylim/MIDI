This wild rose that I hold in my hand
it's the strangest thing I've seen
one but only just started to show
and the leaves are the lightest green.
It's had it's share of the rain
it needs some feeling to light
it's fire and flame again.
One cruel lie and it could die.

Oh Carol oh, won't you let this flower grow
don't kill it Carol.
Oh Carol oh, won't you let this flower grow
don't kill it Carol.

This wild rose that I hold in my hand
it could grow to be so strong
born one night in the calm of the storm
it was made for a rock and roll song.
It's only just seen the light
it could so easily fall
back to the gentle night
one cruel lie and it could die.

Oh Carol oh, won't you let this flower grow,...

It's looking for a place to live
outside all space and time.
Where there's no need for it to fade
there's a secret garden
that I think we can find
lot's of sunshine, there's a touch of shade.

This wild rose that I hold in my hand
it's the strangest thing I've seen,...

Oh Carol oh, won't you let this flower grow,...
