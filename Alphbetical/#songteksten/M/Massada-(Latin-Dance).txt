Singer : MASSADA 
Title  : LATIN DANCE

(Words & music: Z. Mustamu)

If you hear a rhythm calling
But can't get into a trance
Just listen to our music
And try a latin dance
It's a simple thing to close your eyes
And walk up to the sky
I know that you can do it
Don't act as if you're shy
It's a simple thing to move your legs
And dance around the floor
Just show it to the people
And open wide your door
So it's up to you to concentrate
And get into a trance
But if you still can't make it
You should try a latin dance
