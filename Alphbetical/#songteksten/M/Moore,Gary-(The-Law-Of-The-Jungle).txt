Titel    :          THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE

Interpret:          GARY MOORE

We step into a world of danger
Each night answer neon's call
We steer away from passing strangers
Jumping at shadows on the wall

The law of the jungle
Is so hard to break
When death walks behind you
With each step you take

Who knows what's waiting in the darkness
Only the neon sees it all
Who knows what lurks beyond the shadows
The strong survive the weak will fall

The law of the jungle
Is so hard to break
When death walks behind you
With each step you take

The law of the jungle
The law of the jungle
The law of the jungle
Is kill or be killed

The law of the jungle
Is so hard to break
When death walks behind you
With each step you take
