STEPHANIE MILLS - THE MEDICINE SONG

Danger eyes are no surprise in staying wise to you
Shady walks and midnight stalks have shown me what to do
Kept my cool this ain't no fool you think you're
messin' with
Know how to keep you round cause
Know where you been

You think that they really want just you
Better think again
Better think again
I'm the only one knows what to do

Refrain:
'Cause you've been bad oh so bad
Baby and there's only one thing can be done
You need a little bit of this medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine
Mama's gonna give you some medicine

Every time I think you're mine you're up to something new
I've done almost everything to try to get to you
All my friends are just dead ends in helping me along
I just keep on wondering what am I doing wrong

Refrain: ...

There is only one thing left to try
(do it again, do it again)
On this cure I'm sure I can rely

Refrain: ...

(Take your medicine doctor's here)
Take your medicine the nurse is here
Take your medicine don't you want to get cured
Take your medicine
Take your medicine

You gotta take it if you want to shake it
