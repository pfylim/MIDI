 I remember me sittin' on my daddy's knee
dreamin' bout what life had in store for me
when I look back now it really makes me mad
the years I took for granted were the best I had
school was alright
gave me time to fantasize
but one day I woke up
and I realized

I'm livin' in the real world
everythings written in black and white
livin' in the real world
where you don't get nothin' unless you fight

I wanna relax but I don't know how
the pressure on me are much stronger now
I remember the days I didn't have a care
aside from being afraid somebody'd cut my hair
I wanna make it
before my chances are gone
they say be patient
but it takes too long

I'm livin' in the real world
everythings written in black and white
livin' in the real world
where you don't get nothin' unless you fight
Real world
where there ain't no holiday in sight
livin' in the real world
where you don't get nothin' unless you fight

Someday soon I'll settle down for good
there was a time I thought I never would
I'm gonna live with a lady on a quiet beach
I'm gonna have three kids, maybe one of each
I've got to make it
before my chances are gone
they say be patient
but it takes too long

I'm livin' in the real world
everythings written in black and white
livin' in the real world
where you don't get nothin' unless you fight
Real world
where there ain't no holiday in sight
livin' in the real world
where you don't get nothin' unless you fight
