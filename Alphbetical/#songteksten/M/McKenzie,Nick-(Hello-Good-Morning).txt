Title  : HELLO, GOOD MORNING
Artist : NICK MACKENZIE

(Words & music: Nick MacKenzie)

Your eyes are blue
Your kisses are true
I never knew
What they could do
You're telling everyone I know
I'm on your mind each place you go

Chorus:
Hello, good morning, how are you?
How is your weather today?
Hello, good morning, how are you?
Have your moody clouds passed away?
The night was so lovely
But soon it went by
You're still in my arms, dear
Although you were shy
Hello, good morning, how are you?
Have your moody clouds passed away?

Your kiss is soft
As summer rain
You sigh the theme
Of our refrain
When you are there, the grass is green
You're meant for only me, it seems

Chorus: ...
