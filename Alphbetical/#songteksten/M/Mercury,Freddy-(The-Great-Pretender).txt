     The great Pretender              Freddy Mercury


Oh yes I'm the great pretender pretending I'm doin well
my need is such I pretend too much I'm lonely but 
no one can tell
oh yes I'm the great pretender adrift in a world of my own
I play the game but to my real shame you've left me to 
dream all alone

Refrain

Too real is this feeling of make believe
too real when I feel what my heart can conceal oh


Oh yes I'm the great pretender just laughing and gay
like a clown I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown pretending that you're
still around

Refrain

Too real ...
