Title  : HURT

(Words & music: Jimmy Crane/Al Jacobs)

Hurt, to think that you lied to me
Hurt, way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new, and it breaks my heart

Hurt, much more than you'll ever know
Hurt, because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me
Like no one else could ever do
I would never, never hurt you
