Title  : JUST A DISILLUSION

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Hey before you start to judge me by my attitude
I think it's nice and handy
When I tell you baby you are looking good
But do you understand me
When I tell you that 
I've got a different way of life in mind
And I want you to know 
That I haven't got more time than mine
'Cause on the day that I look back at my life
I just don't want it to be a disillusion

When you think I'm heavy than you get me wrong
Because you'll never know me baby
You might have the impression that I'm big and strong
But maybe I'm a baby
'Cause on the day that I look back at my life
And I want you to know that 
I haven't got more time than mine
I just don't want it to be a disillusion

Call me mad but it's my destiny
Something big totally unknown to me
And so I wonder what it's gonna be
I wonder what it's gonna be

So when you're looking further than your nose is long
And when you're nice and handy
You've found yourself a babysit and you'll be gone
How do you understand me
When I tell you that 
I've got a different way of life in mind
And I want you to know that 
I haven't got more time than mine
'Cause on the day that I look back my life
I just don't want it to be a disillusion
