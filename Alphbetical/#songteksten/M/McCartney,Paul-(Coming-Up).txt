Title  : COMING UP

(Words & music: Paul McCartney)

You want a love to last forever
One that will never fade away
I want to help you with your problem
Stick around, I say

Coming up, coming up, yeah
Coming up like a flower
Coming up, I say

You want a friend you can rely on
One who will never fade away
And if you're searching for an answer

Chorus:
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up like a flower
It's coming up yeah

You want some peace and understanding
So everybody can be free
I know that we can get together
We can make it stick with me

Chorus: ...

Coming up, coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up, I say
It's coming up like a flower
It's coming up
I feel it in my bones

You want a better kind of future
One that everyone can share
You're not alone, we all could use it
Stick around we're nearly there

It's coming up, it's coming up everywhere
It's coming up like a flower
It's coming up for all to share
It's coming up yeah
It's coming up anyway
It's coming up like a flower
Coming up
