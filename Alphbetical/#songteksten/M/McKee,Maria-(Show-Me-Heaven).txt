Title  : Show Me Heaven
Singer : Maria McKee


There you go, flashin' forever from your eyes
Hey baby, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denyin', we're flyin' above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace
I never felt this way

Chorus:
Oh - show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Show me heaven babe

Here I go
I'm shakin' just like the breeze
Hey baby
I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denyin'
I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
I've shivers down my spine
And it feels divine

Chorus

If you know what it's like
To dream a dream
Baby hold me tight and let this be
Oh heaven cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh heaven babe - show me heaven
