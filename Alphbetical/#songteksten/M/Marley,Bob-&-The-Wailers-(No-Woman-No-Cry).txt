                             NO WOMAN NO CRY

     As performed by: Bob Marley  


     No woman no cry,.....no woman no cry.....
     no woman no cry,.....no woman no cry.....say, say...

     Said I remember..when we used to sit.....
     in the government yard in Trenchtown.....
     ober-ober-serving the hypocrites...       
     as they would..mingle with the good people we meet.....

     Good friends we 'ad, oh! good friends we've lost.....
     along the way......in this great future..
     you can't forget your past...so dry your tears I say...and..

     No woman no cry,.....no woman no cry.....

     Here little darlin',..don't shed no tears,...
     no woman no cry,.....say, say...

     Said I remember..when we used to sit.....
     in the government yard in Trenchtown.....
     an' then Georgie..would make the fire light...
     as it was..log-wood burnin' through the night.....
     then we would cook..oat-meal porridge...
     of which I'll share with you.....
     my fear..is my only carriage,...so I've got to push on through...
     but while I'm gone I mean..

     Ev'rything's gonna be alright,...ev'rything's gonna be alright...
     ev'rything's gonna be alright,...ev'rything's gonna be alright...
     I say,..ev'rything's gonna be alright,...
     ev'rything's gonna be alright...
     ev'rything's gonna be alright...
     ev'rything's gonna be alright...

     So, woman no cry,.....no no woman,...no woman no cry.....

     Oh my litle sister,...don't shed no tears,...no..woman no cry...
