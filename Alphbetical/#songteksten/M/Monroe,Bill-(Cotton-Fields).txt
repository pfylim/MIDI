When I was a little pretty baby
my mama would rock me in the praidle
In their old cotton field back home
It was down in louisiana
just about a mile from texacana
In their old cotton field back home
When their cotton bow get a rutten
you came deep very much cotton
In their old cotton field back home
It was down in louisiana
just about a mile from texacana
In their old cotton field back home

When I was a little pretty baby
my mama would rock me in the praidle
In their old cotton field back home
It was down in louisiana
just about a mile from texacana
In their old cotton field back home

When I was a little pretty baby

In their old cottnn field back home
It was down in loisiana
