MODERN TALKING - YOU'RE MY HEART YOU'RE MY SOUL

Deep in my heart there's a fire a burnin' heart
Deep in my heart there's desire for a start
I'm diving in emotion it's my world in fantasy
I'm livin' in my livin' in my dreams

Refrain:
You're my heart you're my soul
I'll keep it shinin' everywhere I'll go
You're my heart you're my soul
I'll be holding you for ever stay with you together

You're my heart you're my soul
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know

Let's close the door and believe my burnin' heart
Feeling alright and you open up your heart
I'll keep the candles burning
Let your body melt in mine
I'm livin' in my livin' in my dreams

Refrain: ...
