        La Isla Bonita               Madonna 


Last night I dreamt of San Pedro ,
Just like I'd never gone , I knew the song .
A young girl with eyes like the desert ,
It all seems like yesterday , not far away .

Refrain 

Tropical like island breeze , all of nature , wild and free ,
This is where I long to be , la isla Bonita .
And when the samba played the sun would set so high 
Ring through my ears and sting my eyers , your Spanish lullaby .

I fell in love with San Pedro ,
Warm wind carried on the sea , he called to me : te diso te amo .
I prayed that the days would last , they went so fast .

Refrain 

Tropical the island breeze ...

I want to be where the sun warms the sky ,
when it's time for siesta , you can watch them go by .
Beautiful faces , no cares in the world ,
When a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl .

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro ,
It all seems like yesterday , not far away .

Tropical the island breeze , all of nature , wild and free ,...
Tropical the island breeze , all of nature , wild and free ,...
Te diso te amo - El dijo que te ama .
