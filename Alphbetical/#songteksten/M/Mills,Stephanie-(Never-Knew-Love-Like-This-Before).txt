Title  : NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE
Artist : STEPHANIE MILLS

(Words & music: Mtume/Lucas)

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life
You are my love like this I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all the part off me
Once I was lost and now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need I'll call your name

Chorus:
'Cause I never knew love like this before
Open my eyes
'Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
'Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling to deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for
You are my sunlight and my rain
And time could never change
What we showed forever more

I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

Chorus: ...

Inside of me
I never (never) knew love like this before
Open my eyes
I never (never) never never knew who
Never knew love like this before
