MAI TAI - AM I LOSING YOU FOREVER

It seems like yesterday
When you came into my life
And I began to see a little bit of light
You always told me that our love was strong
But is it really just a friend
Leaving when I come home

To make our love more than a passing thing
You can't say we never tried
But the way you say goodbye to her
I feel like you're slippin' out of my life

Refrain:
Am I losing you forever
I don't understand
Am I losing you will I ever
See you back again
Am I losing you forever
Be a lonely man
Am I losing you will I ever
See you back again

We both went different ways
As the years passed by
You had your friends and baby I had mine

I always trusted you 'cause love was in my heart
Now tell me what to do
Are we driftin' apart

Friends tell me that it's just a normal thing
Something that will be over soon
But do they know that I'll lose everything
And I can't make it on my own

Refrain: ...

Losing you losing you
Losing you losing you

Refrain: ...
