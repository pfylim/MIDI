Title  : Where's The Party
Singer : Madonna


Working Monday through Friday
Takes up all of my time
If I can get to the weekend
Everything will work out just fine
That's when I can go crazy
That's when I can have fun
Time to be with my baby
Time to come undone

Chorus:
Where's the party
I want to free my soul
Where's the party
I want to lose, lose control
Where's the party
I want to free my soul
Where's the party
I want to lose control

Couldn't wait to get older
Thought I'd have so much fun
Guess I'm one of the grown-ups
Now I have to get the job done
People give me the business
I'm not living in fear
I'm just living in chaos
Gotta get away from here

Chorus

Don't know to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
Got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how
I'm ready now

Slow down you move too fast
Gonna make the good times last
Gonna let my hair hang down
I'm ready now

Where's the party
Where's the party

Don't want to grow old too fast
Don't want to let the system get me down
I've got to find a way to make the good times last
And if you'll show me how
I'm ready nowChorus

We can make it all right
We can make you dance
We can make a party last all night
