Title  : JUNGLE ROCK

I was walking through the jungle just the other night
Oh well I heard a big a'rumble and I thought it was a fight
We stopped there to listen, I began to move my feet
It was a jungle drummer doing a knocked out beat

It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A knocked out beat and I had to move my feet
It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock

Oh well I moved a little closer just to get a better view
I saw a chimp and a monkey had done the Suzy Q
Oh well a'gator and a hippo was a doing the bop
While a great big frog was making me hop

It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A knocked out beat and I had to move my feet
It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock

Oh well the fox grabbed the rabbit and they hit the Bunny Hug
And all the beasts that fly was a cutting the rug
Oh well the camel was a jitter bugging with the kangaroo
And the elephant, the mover with the ring-ding-doo

It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
A knocked out beat and I had to move my feet
It was a jungle jungle jungle jungle rock
