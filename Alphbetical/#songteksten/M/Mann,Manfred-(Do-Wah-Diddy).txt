DO WAH DIDDY - MANFRED MANN


There he was just a walkin'down the street
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
poppin'his fingers and shufflin' his feet
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
he looked good he looked fine he looked good
and i nearly lost my mind

Before i knew it he was walking next to me
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
holdin' my hand just as natural as can be
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
we walked on to my door we walked on
then we kissed a little more
wo i knew we were falling in love
yes i did and so i told him
all the things i've been dreamin' of

now we're together nearly ev'ry single day
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
we're so happy and that's how it's gonna stay
singin'do wah diddy diddy down diddy do
well i'm his well i'm his and he's mine
and he's mine
i'm his he's mine wedding bells
are gonna chime

do wah diddy diddy down diddy do

If it's love you want from me
then take it away
everything is not what you see
it's over tod
