Titel    :          GENTLE ON MY MIND

Interpret:          DEAN MARTIN

It's knowing that your door is always open 
and your path is free to walk.

That makes me tend to leave my sleepingbag 
rolled up and stashed behind your couch.

And it's knowing I'm not shackled 
by forgotten words and bonds.

And the ink stains that have dried upon some line,
that keeps you in the backroads 
by the rivers of my mem'ry
that keeps you ever gentle on my mind.

It's not climbing to the rocks 
and ivy planted on their columns 
now that binds me.

Or something that somebody said 
because they thought we fit together walkin'.

It's just knowing by the world 
will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk along.

Some railroad track I find.
That you're moving on the backroads 
by the rivers of my memory and for hours

You're just gentle on my mind.

Thought the wheat fields and the clothes lines 
and junkyards and the highways come between us.

And some other woman crying to her mother 
'cause she turned and I was gone.

I still run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face 
and summer sun might.
Burn me 'til I'm blind.

But not to where I cannot see you walkin' 
on the backroads by the rivers lowing
gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from the gurglin' cracklin' caldron 
in some train yard
my beard a roughening coal pile 
and a dirty hat pulled low across my face.

Through cupped hands 'round a tin 
can I pretend I hold you to my breast and find
that you're waving from the backroads by the rivers 
of my memory ever smilin'

Ever gentle on my mind.
