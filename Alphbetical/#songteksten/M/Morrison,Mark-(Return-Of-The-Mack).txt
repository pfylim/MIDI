12. RETURN OF THE MACK - MARK MORRISON

Ooh come on, yeah.
Well I tried to tell you so (yes I did)
But I guess you didn`t move
As I said this all before
Baby now I got the phone

`Cos I know it from the start
Baby when you broke my heart
That I heard her call my name
I was sure you didn`t move 

You lied to me
All those times I said that I love you
You lied to me 
Yes I try, yes I try
You lied to me
Even though you knew I`d die for you
You lied to me
Yes I cry , yes I cry

Chorus
Return of the mack (yes)
Return of the mack (come on)
Return of the mack (oh my god)
You know that I give in (here I am)
Return of the mack (once again)
Return of the mack (top of the world)
Return of the mack (watch me go)
You know that I give in (here I go)

So I`m back up in my home
Running things to take my swing 
Letting all the people know
That I`m back to run the show
`Cos what they did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you`ve done
So baby listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song 

You lied to me 
She said she`d never turn on me
You lied to me 
But you did , but you did 
You lied to me
All those things you said I`d never do
You lied to me 
But I do , but I do do do

Chorus

You lied to me 
She said she`d never turn on me
You lied to me 
But you did , but you did 
You lied to me
All those things you said I`d never do
You lied to me 
But I do , but I do do do

Chorus repeat
