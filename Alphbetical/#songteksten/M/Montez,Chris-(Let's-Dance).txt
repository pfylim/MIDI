  Hey baby, won't you take a chance?
  Sally Joe, let me have this dance?

  Oh, let's dance
  We'll do the twist to stop them and potatoe too
  Any old dance that you want to do
  But let's dance
  Oh, let's dance.
  
  Hey baby, yeah, you throw me a slow?
  Hold me tight, don't you let me go
  But let's dance

  Any old dance that you want to do
  But let's dance
  Oh, let's dance.
  
  Ok. Way on up
  
  Oh yeah.
  
  Hey baby, if you're all alone
  Maybe you'll let me walk you home
  But let's dance     
  Oh, let's dance
  We'll do the twist to stop them and potatoe too
  Any old dance that you want to do
  But let's dance
  Oh, let's dance.
