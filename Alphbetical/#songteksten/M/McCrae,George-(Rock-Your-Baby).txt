Title  : ROCK YOUR BABY

Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby
Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby
There's nothing to it
Just say you wanna do it
Open up your heart
And let the music start

Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby
Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby
Yeah hold me tight
With all your might
Now let your lovin' flow
Real sweet and slow

Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby
Woman take me in your arms, rock your baby

Come on
