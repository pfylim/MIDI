ANITA MEYER & LEE TOWERS - RUN TO ME

If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
Am I unwise to open up your eyes
To love me and let it be
Like  they said it would be
Me loving you girl
And you loving me
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love

Run to me, whenever you're lonely
Run to me, if you need a shoulder
Now and then you'll need someone older
So darling you run to me

And when you're out in the cold
No-one beside you and no-one to hold
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love me
When there's nothing to lose
Nothing to pay for and nothing to choose
Am I unwise to open up your eyes to love

Run to me, whenever you're lonely
Run to me, if you need a shoulder
Now and then you'll need someone older
So darling you run to me

If ever you've got rain in your heart
Someone has hurt you and torn you apart
And when you're out in the cold
No-one beside you and no-one to hold
You just

Run to me, whenever you're lonely
Run to me, if you need a shoulder
Now and then you'll need someone older
So darling you run to me
