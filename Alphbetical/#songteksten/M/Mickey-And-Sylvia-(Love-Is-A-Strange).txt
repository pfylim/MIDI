Title  : Love Is Strange
Singer : Mickey and Sylvia


Love
Love is strange
Lot of people 
Take it for a game
Once you get it
You never wanna quit
After you've had it
You're in an awful fix

Many people
Don't understand
They think loving
Is money in the hand
Your sweet loving
Is better than a kiss
When you leave me
Sweet kisses I miss

Sylvia
Yes, Mickey
How do you call your lover boy
Come here, lover boy
And if he doesn't answer
Oh lover boy
And if he still doesn't answer
I simply say
Baby, oh baby
My sweet baby, you're the one
Baby, oh baby
My sweet baby, you're the one
