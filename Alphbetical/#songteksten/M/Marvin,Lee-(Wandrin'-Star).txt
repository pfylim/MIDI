I was born under a wandrin` star.
I was born under a wandrin` star.   
Wheels are made for rolling. 
Mules are made to pack.
I`ve never seen a sight,
That didn`t look better looking back.

I was born under a wandrin` star.      
Mud can make you a prisoner.
And the plains can bake you dry.
Snow can burn your eyes.
But only people make you cry.
Home is made for coming from.
For dreams of going to.
Which with any luck will never come true.

I was born under a wandrin` star.      
I was born under a wandrin` star.      
Do I know where hell is.
Hell is in hello.
Heaven is goodbye forever,
It`s time for me to go.
I was born under a wandrin` star.      
A wandrin`, wandrin` star.

Mud can make you a prisoner.
And the plains can bake you dry.
Snow can burn your eyes.
But only people make you cry.
Home is made for coming from.
For dreams of going to.
Which with any luck will never come true.

I was born under a wandrin` star.      
A wandrin`, wandrin` star.
