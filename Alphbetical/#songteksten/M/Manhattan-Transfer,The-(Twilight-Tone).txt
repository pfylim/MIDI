12. TWILIGHT TONE - THE MANHATTAN TRANSFER

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time,
Oh, out of nowhere comes this sound,
This melody that keeps spinning round and round.
Pyramidal locomotion from this mystic unknown zone.

Hear the Twilight, hear the twilight, twilight tone.
Hear the Twilight, hear the twilight, twilight tone.

Unpretentious, girl from Memphis saw the future through her third eye.
People came with skepticism, pickin', testin' her precision, no
oh, suddenly they heard this sound, this melody that keeps spinning round and round
A sign post up ahead is calling from the mystic unknown zone.

Hear the Twilight, hear the twilight, twilight tone.
Hear the Twilight, hear the twilight, twilight tone.

(Instrumental)

On a cold and rainy night
One Mr. Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play the beat, oh, oh,
Suddenly he heard this sound, 
This melody that keeps spinnin' round and round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone.
Hear the Twilight, hear the twilight, twilight tone.
