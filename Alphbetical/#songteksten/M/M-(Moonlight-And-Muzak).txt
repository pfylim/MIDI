Title  : MOONLIGHT AND MUZAK

(Words & music: Robin Scott)

In the tv-world getting smaller all the time
You're the kinda girl, I'd like to wine and dine
Things go better with a subtle harmony
It's the international motel fantasy
Are you the girl I wanted to be
Collaborating on the balcony?

Chorus:
Moonlight and muzak tonight
Moonlight and muzak tonight

we danced all night and I lost all sense of time
To another dan tune I can't get out of my mind
She's a cold war baby from behind the Iron Curtain
I think we made contact, but I can't be certain
Am I the man you wanted to be operating the strategy?

Chorus: ...

I'm sentimental, but don't betray me
With all the incidental music you play me

Chorus: ...
