MERSEY AID - FERRY 'CROSS THE MERCY

Oo, ooh, mmm

Life goes on day after day
Hearts, torn in every way

So ferry 'cross the Mersey
'Cause this land's the place I love
And here I stay

People they rush everywhere
Search with their own secret care

So ferry 'cross the Mersey
I'll always take me there
The place I love

Oh, people around every corner
They seem to smile and say
We don't care what your name is boy
We'll never turn you away

So I'll continue to say
Here's where I'll always will stay

So ferry 'cross the Mersey
'Cause this land's the place I love
And here I stay

Oh oh

Life goes on day after day
Hearts, torn in every way

So ferry 'cross the Mersey
'Cause this land's the place I love
And here I stay

Woh
Here I'll stay
Here I'll stay

This land is the place we love
Ferry 'cross the Mersey
'Cause this land is the place we love

So ferry 'cross the Mersey

So ferry 'cross the Mersey
'Cause this land's the place I love
And here I stay
