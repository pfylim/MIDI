Title  : Open Your Heart
Singer : Madonna


I see you on the street and you walk on by
You make me wanna hang my head
Down and cry
If you gave me half a chance you'd see
My desire burning inside of me
But you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
I've had to work much harder than this
For something I want
Don't try to resist me

Chorus:
Open your heart to me, baby
I hold the lock and you hold the key
Open your heart to me, darlin'
I'll give you love if you, you turn the key

I think that you're afraid to look in my eyes
You look a little sad boy, I wonder why
I follow you around but you can't see
You're too wrapped up in yourself to notice
So you choose to look the other way
Well, I've got something to say
Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

Chorus

Open your heart with the key
One is such a lonely number

Chorus

Don't try to run I can keep up with you
Nothing can stop me from trying
You've got to

Chorus

Open your heart
I'll make you love me
It's not that hard...
If you just turn the key
