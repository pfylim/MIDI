5. Fire - Magic Affair

Watch the fire
Enough of paradise

Here he comes hot to dress hit the ozone
Born negativity runs through the homes
Of the innocent maybe the guilty
Temperature hot cause society built me
So here we go the front he's my brown skin
Waiting for a chance to end all the sin
I'm not a devil but hell I'm raisin'
Fools I'm chasing aiding evasion
Altered hatred racial the made
The mission is hard and the long a cake faded
Bring on the talk 'cause mayhem is at hand
Ready as hate hits the fan

Chorus:
Watch the fire
Enough of paradise
Watch the fire
I'm not this fearful lies
Watch the fire Oo oh oo ooh
Watch the fire
And break this chain of vice

Check my structure erupt and rumble
Kill or be cured as the plan is crumble
Ignorance is blissful lack of education
Culture is doubt wiped out all the nation
Rise up hat and show me the right way
And live your life with the A to the K
47th's so where is heaven?
'Cause hell is earth and life is severing
K.K.K. watch out 'cause the knowledge
The plans you mapped like news pepped college
Light the torch and skin cause you're tripping
Slippin' is slippin' it's time for the whippin'
I'm serious
Too black is the young man
Rapped till a man and still have the upper hand
Bring on the judge 'cause the magic is hard
Back up kid or hell will pull your card

Chorus
(REPEAT)
