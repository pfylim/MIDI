I'm talking, I'm talking
I believe in the power of love
I'm singing, I'm singing
I believe that you can rescue me
With you I'm not a little girl
With you I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me
Comes out, you understand
You see that I'm ferocious
You see that I am weak
You see that I am silly
And pretentious and a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
Don't know exactly what you do
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
And I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And give me hope that there could be
A person that loves me
--------------------------------------------------------
   Rescue me, your love
   Has given me hope
   Rescue me, I'm drowning
   Baby throw out your rope
   With you I'm not a fascist
   Can't play you like a toy
   And when I need to dominate
   You're not my little boy
   You see that I am hungry
   For a life of understanding
   And you forgive my angry little heart
   When she's demanding out the eyes
   Of a world I want to conquer
   And deliver and despise
   And right while I am standing there
   I suddenly begin to care
   And undertstand that there could be
   A person that loves me
--------------------------------------------------------
   Rescue me, your love
   Has given me hope
   Rescue me, I'm drowning
   Baby throw out your rope
   With you I'm not a fascist
   Can't play you like a toy
   And when I need to dominate
   You're not my little boy
   You see that I am hungry
   For a life of understanding
   And you forgive my angry little heart
   When she's demanding out the eyes
   Of a world I want to conquer
   And deliver and despise
   And right while I am standing there
   I suddenly begin to care
   And undertstand that there could be
   A person that loves me
--------------------------------------------------------
Love is understanding -
It's hard to believe
Life can be so demanding
I'm sending out an S.O.S.
Stop me from drowning
Baby I'll do the rest
