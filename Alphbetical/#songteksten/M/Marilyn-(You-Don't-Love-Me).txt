MARILYN - YOU DON'T LOVE ME

Maybe you and I can face the thing that you
Have inside your head sometime
Are there any reasons that you can deliver to my
Door to prove that you don't love me you don't
love me baby oh oh oh oh

Count the tears I have cried in vain for your lies
to penetrate my soul
Count the times I've told you everything I have
to give to you is true
I am freedom yes I am you don't love me you don't
love me baby oh oh oh oh

I'm going down down deeper down but there is
Hope for I will rise I will
Give to you my goal my freedom and when I say
Don't go to strangers
That apply to be your friend they are shallow
and you know I'm freedom

So when all the things that I have dared to
dream have all been crushed
By your obsessions can I carry on alone inside
With no depth of love for you you don't love me
You don't love me baby oh oh oh oh

You don't love me you don't love me baby oh oh oh oh
You don't love me you don't love me baby oh oh oh oh
