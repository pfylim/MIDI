Title  : GREY DAY
Artist : MADNESS

(Words & music: Barson)

When I get home it's late at night
I'm back and bloody from my life
I haven't time to clean my hands
Cuts will only sting me through my dreams

It's well past midnight as I lie
In a semyi-conscious state
I dream odd people fighting me
Without any reason I can see

Chorus:
In the morning I awake
My arms, my legs, my body aches
The sky outside is wet and grey
So begins another weary day
So begins another weary day

After eating I got out
People passing by my shout
I can't stand this agony
Why don't they talk to me

In the park I have to rest
I lie down and I do my best
The rain is falling on my face
I wish I could sink without a trace

Chorus: ...

In the park I have to rest
I lie down and I do my best
The rain is falling on my face
I wish I could sink without a trace

Chorus: ...
