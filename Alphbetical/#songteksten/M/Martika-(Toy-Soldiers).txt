MARTIKA - TOY SOLDIERS

(Words & music: Martika Jay/Robert Etoll)

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers

It wasn't my intention to mislead you
It never should've been this way
What can I say it's true I did extend the invitation
I never knew how long you'd stay

When you hear temptation call
It's your heart that takes a fall
Won't you come out and play with me

Refrain:
Step by step heart to heart (heart to heart)
Left right left we all fall down (all fall down)
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit (bit by bit) torn apart (torn apart)
We never win but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It's getting hard to wake up in the morning (morning)
My head is spinning constantly how can it be
How could I be so blind to this addiction
If I don't stop the next one's gonna be me

Only emptiness remains it replaces all all the pain
Won't you come out and play with me

Refrain: ...

We never win
Ooh ooh ooh ooh only emptiness remains
It replaces all all the pain
Won't you come out and play with me

Refrain: ...

Wages on oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

Step by step oh-oh heart to heart (heart to heart)
Left right left we all fall down (all fall down)
All fall down all fall down
Like toy soldiers
