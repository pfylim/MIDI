ZIGGY MARLEY - TOMORROW PEOPLE

(Words & music : Z. Marley)

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?

Today you say you deyah
Tomorrow you say you're gone
But you're gone so long
If there is no love in your heart, so sorry
Then there is no hope for you, true, true

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Come on
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Ten Years

So you're in the air
But you still don't have a thing to spare
You're flying high
While we're on the low-o-o-oh
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Tell me now
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Ten years

Stop telling me the same story
Today you say you deyah
Tomorrow you say you're gone and you're not coming back
If there is no love in your heart oh now
There will never be hope for you

Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow people, how long will you last?
Ten years
Tomorrow people, where is your past?
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, come on
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, come on
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, no soon come
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, soon come
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, soon come
Tomorrow, tomorrow people, today is here

If you don't know your past, you don't know your future
Everyone, don't know your past, don't know your future everyman
Don't know your past, don't know your future come on
Don't know your past, don't know your future

How many nations
How many people did that one catch
How many nations did that one catch
Didn't know past, don't know your future
Didn't know past, don't know your future
