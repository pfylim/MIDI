MIAMI SOUND MACHINE - BAD BOY

Bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys
Always get so restless, nothin' but trouble
Leave me feelin' breathless, nothin' but trouble

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
You naughty bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me on so right
My heart goes beat beat, beat beat, beat beat

Bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad boy
You make me feel so good
Knew you would

Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy
Always get so restless, nothin' but trouble
Leave me feelin' breathless, nothin' but trouble

And when he drives me home
I feel save at night
He'll call me on the phone
It goes ring ring ring ring-a-ring ring

Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy

Always get so restless, nothin' but trouble
Leave me feelin' breathless, nothin' but trouble
