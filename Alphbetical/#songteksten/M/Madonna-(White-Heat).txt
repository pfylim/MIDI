Chorus:
Get up stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Chorus

You think you can have my love for free
Well, I've got news for you
That's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hangin' round my door
If you're not ready to give
You're not gonna get much more
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy, this time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Chorus

Can you feel the rhythm of my mind
Boy, I've got so much to give
But I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart put on a show
'Til you surrender baby
You've got to let it go
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy, this time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Chorus

Drop your weapons, you'd better come clean
I've got you covered, I'll catch you 
When you fall to me
I'm not gonna hurt you, I'm not that kind
We're not goin' mowhere 'til you have a change of mind
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy, this time you're gonna
Gonna have to play my way
Come on make my day

Chorus

I'm so good for you baby, here I come
I'm gonna get to you before the day is done
