Title  : MAGGIE'S AMBITIOUS MOTHER

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Maggie was born to be a lonely soul
As a victim of father's failures
They had clearly told her
Which way to go
But forgotten to explain her
Always trying to steal the show
Always beating the rest
Always being the best
There was no other way to go
She had a very ambitious mother

She went to school after being a miracle
Never thought of her education
'Cause mama decided which way to go
Filled her up with her own frustrations
Always trying to steal the show
Always beating the rest
Always being the best
There was no other way to go
She had a very ambitious mother
Oh, Maggie's ambitious mother

Maggie, Maggie go
Maggie, steal the show
For your dad, he loves you so

When she had to do it by herself
She wasn't able to think about it
And her mommy said
She had a lot to tell 
So when she started to talk
She shouted

Maggie is still that lonely soul
But now depending on her own failures
'Cause nobody ever told her where to go
And that's what you can't explain her

Maggie's trying to steal the show
Maggie's beating the rest
Maggie's being the best
She's got no other way to go
She had a very ambitious mother

Oh Maggie's ambitious mother
She had a very ambitious mother
