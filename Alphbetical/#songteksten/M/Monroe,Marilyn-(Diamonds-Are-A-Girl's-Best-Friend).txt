A kiss on the hand may be quite continental,
but diamonds are a girl's best friend;
a kiss may be grand but it won't pay the rental
on your humble flat, or help you at the automat.
Men grow cold as girls grow old,
and we all lose our charms in the end;
but square cut or pear shape, 
these rocks don't lose their shape, 
diamonds are a girl's best friend.

There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer,
but diamonds are a girl's best friend;
there may come a time when a hard boiled employer
thinks you're awful nice but get that "ice" or else no dice.
He's your guy when stocks are high, 
but beware when they start to descend;
It's then that those louses go back to their spouses,
diamonds are a girl's best friend.
