Singer : ANITA MEYER 
Title  : THE ALTERNATIVE WAY

Until today I felt kind a happy
Nothing special but I was happy 
Just one look further inside yourself
And you will see what I wanna say

Though I know it's easy to tell you
And besides I know I don't have to
I found myself a song to sing you
To be sure you're feeling the same

Never in my life I felt the feeling
I felt somebody so near
Things that my home town would never
Whisper in my ear

You know until today I felt kind a happy
Nothing special but I was happy
Just one look further inside yourself
And you will see what I wanna say

Never in my life I felt the feeling
I felt somebody so near
Things that my home town would never
Whisper in my ear

male:
It's been with us, all these years
I could only see it through my ears
There ain't no need for you to stay
Feel me within you every day

(next two phrases together)
female:
And then I fell back to where I was happy
Nothing special but I was happy
Until you have made me find myself
And I see the alternative way

male:
And then you fell back to where you were happy
nothing special but you were happy
Until I have made you find yourself
And see the alternative way
