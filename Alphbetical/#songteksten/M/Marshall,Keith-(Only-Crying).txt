Title  : ONLY CRYING
Artist : KEITH MARSHALL

(Words & music: Keith Marshall)

Ain't no big sensation, committed no crime
Only recollections of forgotten old affections
Lost in time, only crying
Sometimes I wish, on a night like this

Only crying, well, the moonlight kind of threw me
Only crying, and the red wine's getting to me
Only crying, it'ss my broken heart that's healing
Can't a man show his feelings?
Am I meant to be a clown in pantomime?
Just a raindrop in the ocean
Just a simple sad emotion
Only crying, ooh ooh

I don't understand it, what's all the fuss?
No I never planned it
Should we leave now empty handed?
Guess we must, dust to dust
It's a crying shame, I'll never be the same

Only crying, well, the moonlight kind of threw me
Only crying, and the red wine's getting to me
Only crying, as the wind blows soft and gentle
Call me foolish, sentimental
I'm a man, not a stone without a heart
Well I know, I ain't supposed to
It's the man who loved you most who's
Only crying, ooh ooh
Only crying, na na
