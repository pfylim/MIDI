                  You can win if you want


You packed your things in a carpet bag,
left home never looking back.
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes,
music where ever you go.
You don't fit, in a small town world,
but I feel you are the girl for me.
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes,
your leavin' town where nobody know.

You can win if you want, if you want it you will win,
on your way you will see, that's life is more than fantasy.
Take my hand, follow me, oh you get a brand new friend for your life.
You can win if you want, if you want it you will win,
oh come on, take your change, for a brand new wild romance.
Take my hand for the night, and your feeling will be right,
hold me ti-i-i-i-ight.

Oh darkness finds you on your own,
endless highway keep on rolling on,
you are miles and miles from your home,
but you never wan't to phone your home.
A steady job and a nice young man,
your parents have your future planed,
rings on her fingers, paint on her toes,
thats the way your story goes.
