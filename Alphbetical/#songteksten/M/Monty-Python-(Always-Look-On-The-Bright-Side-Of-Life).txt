Some things in life are baid, thy gone really may you maid,

When you're chewing on last grizzle, dan't grumble, give a whistle,

Always look on the bright side of life, come on,

Life's a piece of shit when you look at it,

You'll see, it's all a show, keep on laughin' as you go,
just remember that the last laugh is on you, ain...

Refrain  3x

Always look on the bright side of life,
always look on the right side of life,
always look on the bright side of life,
