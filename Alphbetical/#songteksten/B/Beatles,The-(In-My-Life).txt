    There are places I remember, all my life though some have changed

    Some forever, not for better ,some have gone and some remain

    All these places have their moments, with lovers and friends

    I still can recall

    Some are dead and some are living, in my life I love them all

    But of all these friends and lovers, there is no one compares with you

 And these memories lose their meaning, when I think of love as something new

    Though I know never-ever lose affection for people and things

    that went before

    I know often stop and think about them, in my life I love you more

    Though I know never-ever lose affection for people and things

    that went before

    I know often stop and think about them, in my life I loved you more

    I love you more, I....love.....you....more
