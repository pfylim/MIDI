BANGLES - A HAZY SHADE OF WINTER

Time, time, time
See what's become of me
While I looked around
For my possibilities
I was so hard to please
But look around
Leaves are brown
And the sky is
A hazy shade of winter

Hear the salvation army band
Down by the riverside
It's bound to be a better ride
Than what you've got planned
Carry your cup in your hand
And look around
Leaves are brown now
And the sky is
A hazy shade of winter

Hang on to your hope my friend
That's an easy thing to say
But if your hopes should fade away
Simply pretend
That you can build them again
Look around
The grass is high
The fields are ripe
It's the spring time of my life
Seasons change with the scenery
Weaving time in a tapestry
Won't you stop and remember me
At any convenient time?
Funny how my mem'ry skips
While rearranging manuscripts of
Unpublished rhyme
Drinking my wodka and lime
But look around
Leaves are brown
There's a patch of snow on the ground
Look around
Of snow on the ground
