When you have a worried mind,
take vacation, the weather is fine
everything is different
when you remember the sun.
Everything is differnet
when you have a lot of fun.

Come on and sing for the day
and you'll see that ev'rything goes better
why don't you sing for the day
and you'll find that love will come your way.

Beautiful people, beautiful sun,
I like to swim, 'cause the water is warm
every night we'll have a party
'till the morning comes
everyone is happy don't you
stay there on your own.

Come on and sing for the day,...
