Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : SAVE YOUR KISSES FOR ME

Though it hurts to go away
It's impossible to stay
But there's one thing I must say before I go
I love you (I love you)
You know
I'll be thinking of you
In most everything I do

Not the time is moving on
And I really should be gone
But you keep me hanging on for one more smile
I love you (I love you)
All the while
With your cute little wave
Will you promise that you save your

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye
Don't cry honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
So long honey, so long
Hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
Cos you know I'll have to say

That I've got to work each day
And that's why I go away
But I count the seconds till I'm home with you
I love you (I love you)
It's true
You're so cute honey gee
Won't you save them up for me
Your

Kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye
Don't cry honey, don't cry
Gonna walk out the door
But I'll soon be back for more
Your kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
So long honey, so long
Hang on baby hang on
Don't you dare me to stay
Cos you know you've got to save
Your kisses for me
Save all your kisses for me
Bye bye baby bye bye
Don't cry honey don't cry
Won't you save them for me
Even though you're only three
