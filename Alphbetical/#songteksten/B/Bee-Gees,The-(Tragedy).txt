Singer : BEE GEES 
Title  : TRAGEDY

(Words & music: Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb/Barry Gibb)

Here I am in a lost and lonely part of town
Held in time in a world of tears I slowly drown
Going home I just can't make it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Chorus:
Tragedy, when the feelings is gone
And you can't go on, it's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
Why it's hard to bear
With no one to love you, you're going nowhere
Tragedy when you loose control and you got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning cries and you don't know why
It's hard to bear with no one beside you
You're going nowhere

Night and day there's a burning down inside of me
Burning love with a yearning that won't let me be
Down I go and I just can't take it all alone
I really should be holding you, holding you
Loving you, loving you

Chorus: ...

When the morning cries and your heart just dies
It's hard to bear with no one beside you
You're going nowhere

Chorus: ...
