Title  : Giving Up The Ghost
Singer : Bee Gees


There's a young girl lost
On the edge of town
Don't see no futere, it's blind
Don't give up
When you're upside down
You just keep inside ...

You know we all cry ...
Whaen we're alone
Someone like you
And the promise that we won't be

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost

Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost

Don't be a hero
In the name of love
Don't leave me waiting in line
No ties that bind
No ball and chain
The ghost is waiting outside

I'm searching so high
I'm searching low
Someone like you
Baby I'm not ...

Giving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost

Giving up the ghost
We can never stop
Giving up the ghost

You know we all cry
When we are alone
Someone like you
We know oh,
I'm searching so high
I'm searching low
Someone like you
We know oh, oh, ohGiving up the ghost
Giving up the ghost
Never you and I
Giving up the ghost
