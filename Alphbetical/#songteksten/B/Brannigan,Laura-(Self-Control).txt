      Self Control        Laura Brannigan 


Oh oh oh ! Oh oh oh
On the night is my world
City lights painted girls
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters .

In the night no control
Through the wall something breaking
Wearing white as you're walking
Down the street of my soul

Refrain

You take myself , you take my self control
You take me living only for the night 
Before the morning comes the story's told     
You take myself , you take my self control.


I , I live among the creatures of the night 
I haven't got the will to try to fight 
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

Night I'm living in a moment of a dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something
So I guess I just believe it 
That tomorrow never knows
