Oh yeh, I'll tell you something 
I think you'll understand,

I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

now let me hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.

And when I  touch you
I feel happy inside,
it's such a feeling
that my love I can't hide
I can't hide, I can't hide,


Yeh, you got that something,
I think you'll understand
when I feel that something,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand,
I wanna hold your hand.
