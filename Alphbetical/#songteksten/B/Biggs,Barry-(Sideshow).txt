Title  : SIDESHOW

(Words & music: Bob Eli/Vinny Barrett)

Stop right up hurry, hurry
Before the show begins, my friend
Stand in line, get your tickets
I hope you will attend
It'll only cost ya fifty cents to see
What life has done to those like you and me

See the man with the broken heart
You'll see that he is sad
He hurts so bad
See the girl who has lost
The only one she's ever had
There's got to be no sadder show to see
No doubt about it satisfaction guaranteed

Refrain:
So let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry
Let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

See the man who's been crying
For a million years, so many tears
See the girl who's collecting
Broken hearts for souvenirs
It's more exciting than a one man band
The saddest little show in all the land

Refrain: ...
