Title  : I DON'T LIKE MONDAYS

(Words & music: Bob Geldoff)

The silicone chip inside her head
Gets switched to overload
And nobody's going to go to school today
She's going to make them stay at home
And daddy doesn't understand it
He always said she was good as gold
And he can see no reasons
'Cause there are no reasons
What reason do you need to be sure, oh, oh, oh

Chorus:
Oh, oh, oh, tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
Tell me why I don't like mondays
I want to shoo-oo-oo-oot the whole day down

The telex machine is kept so clean
It types to a waiting world
Mother feels so shocked father's world is rocked
And their thoughts turn to their own little girl
Sweet sixteen, ain't that teacher keen
Now it ain't so neat to admit defeat
They can see no reasons
'Cause there are no reasons
What reasons do you need, oh, oh, oh

Chorus: ...

Down, down shoot along girl

And all the playing's stopped in the playground
Now she wants to play with her toys a while
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
And the lesson today is 'how to die'
And then the bullhorn crackles
And the captain tackles with the problems
And the hows and whys
And he can see no reasons
'Cause there are no reasons
What reasons do you need to die, oh, oh, oh

Chorus: ...
