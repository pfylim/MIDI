Title  : HANDS OFF, SHE'S MINE

(Words & music: The Beat)

I told my friend I checked for you
He told me that he liked you too
But then I saw him kissing you
I could have died when he said:
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine

I wandered home and cried
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine

I knew that this love was real
Always is when it comes mixed with fear
I knew that I could wait
Although it just might take a thousand years
Said
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
Until the end of time
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine

La la la lao
Now we're going steady
Been together seven weeks
I chant down all those other guys
Theat we see on the street

When I say
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine
It takes up all my time
Hands off, she's mine
Hands off, she's mine

Hands of me daughter
I tell you get your hands of me daughter
Come make fe tell ya

Said: don't mess around ya
Come make fe tell ya
Said I don't want fe ketch ya
Brrrraagh

Funny how the best things
Never last more then a day
I thought she was my girlfriend
Till I heard that someone else was saying

Hands off, she's mine (10x)
