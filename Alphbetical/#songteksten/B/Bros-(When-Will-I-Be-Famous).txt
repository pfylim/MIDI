BROS - WHEN WILL I BE FAMOUS?

When will I, will I be famous?
Yes you're suitably at one
With your body and the sun, yes you are

You've read Karl Marx
And you've taught yourself to dance
You're the best by far
But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention, hey

refrain:
When will I, will I be famous?
I can't answer, I can't answer that
When will I see my picture in the paper?
I can't answer, I can't answer that

When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me baby

You're a slave to fashion
And your life is full of passion
It's the way you are
You've suffered for your art
With the jogging in the park
You know you should go far

But you keep asking the question
One you're not supposed to mention
I(I'm not supposed to mention)

refrain: ...

Oh I can't tell you when you'll see your name
Up in lights
When will I, will I be famous?
You keep asking me babe (I can't wait)

You won't suffer in silence (suffer)
You're a talent you know that
I've noticed (I've noticed)
You'd like to be a legend (oh oh)
A big star over night (tell me when)

I can't answer your question (I can't wait)
It's driving me insane (ooh)
Your impossible impatience
Tearing at my brain (I can't take it, take it no more)
