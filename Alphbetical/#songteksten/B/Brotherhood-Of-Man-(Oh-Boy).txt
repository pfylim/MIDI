Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : OH BOY

(Words & music: T. Romeo)

It's so warm in here
Outside the night is clear
I need a walk
Have myself a little talk
Sleep baby sleep
While your mama walks the street
To find your daddy

Refrain:
Boy, oh boy
The mood I'm in
The pain I feel in missing him
Oh boy, oh boy
I can't explain
He haunts my mind and racks my brain

I could comb every home
Every neighborhood bar
I could ride every greyhound
Or railroad car just to find him
And say where ever you are
Come on home we love you boy

Refrain: ...

Weep I walk and weep
Thru the downtown streets
I wander sadly
Boy oh boy

Refrain: ...
