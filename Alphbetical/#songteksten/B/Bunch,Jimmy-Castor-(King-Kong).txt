Title  : KING KONG

Komme samme kong
We wah wah wah wah

He lived in the jungle where he was born, the king
His great strength made him lord of everything
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so legend tells us was, King Kong

His height was never measured but was great
The jungle shook beneath his mighty weight
His arms were muscled steady as a tree
His chest was thick and wide as it could be

Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong
Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong

He didn't dance all party
He spoke at times but hardly
One woman heard his love call
But he was too big and too tall
We wah wah wah wah

One day when Kong was sleeping on his back
A tyrannosaurs launched a sneak attack
They fought, first Kong went down then up again
The fight went on, no one knew who would win
Kong reached and seized the monster with both hands
And summoned all the strength at his command
He stretched the creature's mouth till it was split
Then like a child he began to play with it
He beat his hairy chest and looked around
Five miles away they heard his roaring sound

Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong
Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong

From everyone he knew he got respect
Whoever failed to give it, he'd correct
No creature crossed his path and lived for long
His name, so the legend tells us, was King Kong

Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong
Komme samme King Kong
Komme samme Kong
