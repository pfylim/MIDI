Title  : SORRY I'M A LADY

(Words & music: R. Soja/F. Dostal)

Hooy, here comes that man again
Something in the way he moves
Makes me sorry, I'm a lady

Hello stranger, you're a danger
To the law and order here
They don't like men like you
In our city
You're too pretty, cool and witty
You're a real bad company
I should have stayed away from today

Chorus:
Sorry I'm a lady, sorry I'm a lady
I would rather be, rather be
Just a little shady, just a little shady
Naughty dynamite, dynamite
Sorry I'm a lady, sorry I'm a lady
Have you got a light, got a light for me tonight

I need power, I need passion
Give me more than sympathy
I've got a lot to learn before tomorrow
Like a flower, wants a shower
I want you to make me bloom
Those gentlemen in grey, can hear me say

Chorus: ...

You're a winner, I'm a sinner
No excuse, no alibi
Temptations won the game
And you are to blame

Chorus: ...
