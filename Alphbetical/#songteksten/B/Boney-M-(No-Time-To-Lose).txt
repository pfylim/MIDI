No time to lose
My man is coming in today
No time to lose
I know he must be on his way
No time to lose
I wanna look just right for him
No time to lose
Tonight will be the night for him
My man is big and strong
And not the shyest one
When he gets hold of me
We're having lots of fun
There's no denyin'
He sends me flyin'
He does so much for me
Yessirree
Yessirree
Got the touch for me
--------------------------------------------------------
No time to lose
My man is here and free again
No time to lose
And so it's him and me again
No time to lose
I'm gonna do the dressing up
No time to lose
So he can do the messin' up
He won't be knocking
He'll come on rocking
Though he'll be reall' wild
He's such a honey child
There's no denyin'
He sends me flyin'
He does so much for me
Yessirree
Yessirree
Got the touch for me
--------------------------------------------------------
No time to lose
I got myself a winner now
No time to lose
No longer he's a sinner now
No time to lose
There'll be some lovin' soon
No time to lose
It's almost like a honeymoon
No time to lose
No time to lose
