When I want you in my arms,
when I want you and all your charms,
whenever I want you
all I have to do is dream
dream, dream, dream.

When I feel blue in the night
and I need you to hold me tight,
night or day;
Only trouble is, gee whiz,
I'm dreaming my life away.
I need you so that I could die,
I love you so and that is why
whenever I want you,
all I have to do is dream,
all I have to do is dream.
