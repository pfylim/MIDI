Title  : IBIZA

(Words & music: B. Corbett)

This old town is mighty cold
No one laughs a lot
All my stories have been told
And some ain't worth a jot
Got to get away from here
Find myself some fun
Gonna take the next plane out
And fly into the sun

So we're flying away to Ibiza
Taking a plane to Ibiza
Seeking my sweet senorita
I'm waiting for my senor
Going again to Ibiza
Can't wait to be there once more
Island of love, the sun up above
Ibiza, senor, por favor

Tired of this old city life
Man, it's getting rough
Sick of all this nine to five
I've really had enough
Seems my life is full of lows
Overdue for highs
Got to ride that big white bird
Into those sunny skies

Flying away to Ibiza
Take a plane to Ibiza
