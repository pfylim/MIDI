Singer : BEE GEES
Title  : NIGHTS ON BROADWAY

Here we are in a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark
When my eyes couldn't see you
Well I have to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away, blaming it all

On the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs singing them
Straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them
Sweet sounds to that crazy crazy town now

In my place there are so many others
Standing in the line
How long will they stand between us
Well I have to follow you
Though you did not want me to
That won't stop my loving you
I can't stay away, blaming it all
On the nights on Broad way
Singing them love songs
Singing them straight to the heart songs
Blaming it all
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them
Sweet sounds to that crazy crazy town
I will wait
Even if it takes forever I will wait
Even if it takes a lifetime some how I feel inside
You never ever left my side
Make it like it was before
Even if it takes a lifetime takes a lifetime
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singing them love songs singing them
Straight to the heart songs
On the nights on Broadway
Singing them
Sweet sounds to that crazy crazy town
