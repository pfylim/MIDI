BOBBY BROWN - ON OUR OWN

(Words & music: L.A. Babyface/Daryl Simmons)

Yeah if you want something done
You gotta do it yourself
Oh uh yeah (all on our own)
I think this is gonna be another one of those funky ones
Hot soul dance ha ha ha (all on our own)

If I was you and you were me
You'd wanna be winning
If you want something bad yeah
Ya gotta want to give your all
'Cause we believe so much in we
And no we're not kiddin'
If you feel the same as me y'all
Gotta wanna take the ball

Now I found out that nothing is given (given)
Don't know where the cards may fall (may fall)
All I know is that we've gotta get it (get it get it)
We've gotta make it on our own now uh

Well I guess we're gonna have to take control
(All on our own)
If it's up to us we've gotta take it home
(All on our own)

Now can't you see that all we need
To be a go getter
Gotta make our own decisions
Y'gotta go for what ya know
It comes a time in our lives
You wanna be bigger
We gotta keep keep on pushing
Y'gotta learn to take control yeah
Now I found out that nothin' is given (given, given)
Don't know where the cards may fall (may fall)
All I know is that we've gotta get it (get it get it)

Too hot to handle too cold to hold
They're called the Ghostbusters and they're in control
Had'em throwing parties for a bunch of children
While all the while the slime was under the building
So they packed up regrouped got a grip came equipped
Grabbed the proton packs out the back and they split
Found out about Vigo the master of evil
Tried to battle my boys but that's not legal
