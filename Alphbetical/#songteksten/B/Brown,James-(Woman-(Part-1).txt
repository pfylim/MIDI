Singer : JAMES BROWN 
Title  : WOMAN (PART 1)

spoken:
I'm a woman

What makes a man break up inside
And what makes a man give up his pride
What makes a man feel he's begun to fail
And when he can't win
He thinks he can't win
Tell me what makes a man jealous
Of each other tacturned against his brother
(Now here's the reason)
She makes a cloudy day
Seem bright she makes a night-mare
Turn into the warmest night
You know she makes trouble seem so-so
She can turn a hard-ship
And she makes it so easy to cross
She brings life into the world
Over and over again
Woman in the world could ever bear those pains
She never lets you know when she feels bad
And she smiles when she feels sad
And when you feel blue she knows her place
Right beside you, and I wanna know what makes man
stop tiring and who's the only one
Can stop a baby from crying
