Singer : GEORGE BAKER SELECTION 
Title  : PALOMA BLANCA

When the sun shines on the mountain
And the night is on the run
It's a new day, it's a new way
And I fly up to the sun

I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new born hay
I can hear God's voice us calling
On my golden skylight day

Refrain:
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
And no one can take my freedom away

Once I had my share of loosing
And they locked me on a chain
And they tried to break my power
Oh I still can feel the pain

Refrain: ...

When the sun shines on the mountain
And the night is on the run
It's a new day, it's a new way
And I fly up to the sun

Refrain: ...
