Title  : NIGHT FEVER

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin/Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it
On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's something we can share
We can steal it

Chorus:
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me yeah
And the feeling is bright
Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am praying for this moment to last
Living on the music so fine
Born on the wind, making it mine
Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the morning
I got fire in my mind
I got higher in my walking
And I'm glowing in the dark
I give you warning

Chorus: ...
