ROBERTA (SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES)  - BLUE HAZE


They, asked how I knew
My true love was true.
I of course replied, something here inside, cannot be denied.
They said someday you'll find,
All who love are blind,
When your heart's on fire,
You must realize, smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed them and I
Gayly laughed to think they could doubt my love.
Yet today my love has flown away
I'm without my love
Now laughing friends deride 
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say, "When a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes"
