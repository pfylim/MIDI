Title  : WOMAN

Every time I see that woman
Every time I see that girl
Secret feelings come inside me
Something's burning in my head
Every time I see that woman

Every time I see that woman
Every time I see that girl
Secret feelings come inside me
I just want their for myself
Every time I see that woman

Oh, my woman, oh my girl

When I'm lonely in my bedroom
And I think about that girl
Secret feelings come inside me
And they fill my empty head
Every time I need you woman
Oh, my woman, oh my girl
