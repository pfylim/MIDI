Just clap you'r hands ev'rybody
Ev'rybody come on, clap your hands
You can ring my bell ev'rybody
Ev'rybody come on ring my bell

We got a new thing out, gonna make you shout
Got rhythm, got heat, gonna move your feet
Got class, finesse, a whole lotta style
Gonna be around for a long long while
Got something for the young, something for the old
Something that's missing from the rock and roll
Just clap your hands, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands
Just clap your hands ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands
It'll make you move, it'll make you go
Puts a capital "D" on the word "Disco"
Started in the states, jumped to Japan
Now it's known from the land to land
It's known in Egypt, it's known in Rome
Known in Puerto Rico, from home to home
Just clap your hands ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands
Just clap your hands, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands
You heard it in England, you heard it in France
The music bound to make you dance
the music good and sounds terrific
Written in Chinese and hieroglyphics
It's got a new beat and I want you to know
It's a new thing out called mestizo
Just clap your hands, ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands
Just clap your hand's ev'rybody
Ev'rybody clap your hands

Just clap your hands ev'rybody,...

Rock, swing, shake, sing, dance ev'rybody, to a brand new thing
Get up, ev'rybody, and Boogie to the Beat
Fly, girls, cod, gogo, stamp your feet
Just ring my bell, ding-a-ling-a-ling
Come on, ev'rybody, come on and shake your thing
Just rock, ev'rybody, ev'rybody shake your thing
Just shake, ev'rybody, ev'rybody rock and sing

I'm a wizard in biology, don#t you know,
I can disect a frog from head to toe
I can play basketball and jump so high
I can leap tall buildings I can even fly
I'm known in the east I'm known in the west
My blood is mestizo, known as the best
Just rock ev'rybody, ev'rybody shake your thing
Just shake ev'rybody, ev'rybody rock and sing,
They'rs dancing in the streets
Rap-o-clap-o, that's the sound
Smack 'em in the head, kick 'em in the knee
Wake 'em from the dead to dance with me
just kick off your shoes and count to five
Rock to the rhythm and come, come alive
One two three four five
Rock ev'rybody, ev'rybody come alive
Just clap your hands, ev'rybody...
