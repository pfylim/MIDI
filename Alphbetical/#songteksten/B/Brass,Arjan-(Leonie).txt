Refrain:
Leonie, leonie, I dream of only you
And it seems you're somewhere around
With anything I do, with anything I do
Leonie, leonie, I dream my life away
Make believe you're still around
In dreams of yesterday

Leonie, all those years I searched for you
But you never came to end the dream
Leonie, when you are flowing on my mind
Like a never, like a never ending stream

Refrain: ...

Leonie, I recall the days I spent with you
The little words and thins we used to say and do
Leonie, I can't get you off my mind
And I wonder why I lost you
