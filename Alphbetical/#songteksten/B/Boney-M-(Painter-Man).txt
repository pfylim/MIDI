Went to college studied art
To be an artist, make a start
But started hard gamed my degree
But none seemed to notice me
--------------------------------------------------------
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
--------------------------------------------------------
Tried cartoons and comic books
Dirty postcards, womans books
But here was where the money lay
Classic art had has it's day
--------------------------------------------------------
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
--------------------------------------------------------
Do adverts fo T.V.
Household soaps and brands of tea
But labels all around the cans
Who would be a painter man
--------------------------------------------------------
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
Painter man, Painter man
Who would be a Painter man
