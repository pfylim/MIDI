B.V.S.M.P. - I NEED YOU

(Words & music: ...)

Yo', hey check this out
I love you baby, oh, oh
I want to sing a song, girl
I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
You are what I want
Oh girl, I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
Oh baby you are what I want
Yo', hey check this out

What's it gonna take to get your attention
You keep my mind hanging in suspension
I want you that's what I'm trying to say
And for you love night and day I pray
Where have you been all of my life
You are a perfect girl-friend and I want you for my wife
I'm after your heart oh don't you see
I'm not out to get your virginity
And I understand why you are playing hard to get
And for you girl I have all due respect
Let me be the one that you select

I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
You are what I want
Oh girl, I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
Oh baby you are what I want
You are the one I need
Oh babe, check this out

I never wanted nothing like I want you
I'm telling you straight on I'm trying to be polite
When I met you it was love at first sight
I feel like I'm filling out on application
So rad my resume and have no hesitation
Every time I see a girl I fall in love again
Wish that we could be more than just friends
And I'll be there whenever you take a fall
And will live happily ever after a wall

No fussing of fighting we sing a song
If you were to cry how we belong
You are my girl and you shine like gold
You are hard to get and will be hard to hold
I think about you from dusk till dawn
And that look in your eyes makes me weep
You are a quiet female you hardly ever speak
We may not be good at real romance
But I can do my best if I can get my chance

I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
You are what I want
Oh girl, I need you
Sha-na-na-na-na-na
Oh baby you are what I want
You are the one I need
Oh babe, check this out

Give me a chance to slow and prove
You baby doll don't front the move
I'm not like the other guys I'm different
Like you, you know I'm the innocent
I shouldn't tell you but I keep urging
You may not believe it but I'm still a virgin
Do you want my love I need to know
We are talking this situation too slow
Say yes and I keep a smile gone without your face
But if you say no you are gone without trace
And satisfaction is guaranteed
And you know I want your love so much
And I'm singing this song with a M.C. touch

I need you
You are the one I want
And I gotta have you babe
Oh oh oh
You are the one I need, oh babe
You are the one I need, oh babe
You were sent from heaven above
Sweet and soft as a dove
And I love you, I love you, I love you
