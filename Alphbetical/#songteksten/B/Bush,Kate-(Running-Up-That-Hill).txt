KATE BUSH - RUNNING UP THAT HILL

It doesn't hurt me
Do you want to feel how it feels
Do you want to know, know that it
doesn't hurt me
Do you want to hear 'bout the
deal that I'm making
You, you and me

Refrain:
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
If I only could oh

You don't want to hurt me
But see how deep the bullets lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
Ooh there is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love
Tell me we both matter don't we?
You
You and me
You and me won't be unhappy

Refrain: ...

You
You and me
You and me won't be unhappy
C'mon baby, c'mon darlin'
Let me steal this moment from you now
Come on angel, c'mon, c'mon darling
Let's change the experience oh

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems (2x)

If I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
