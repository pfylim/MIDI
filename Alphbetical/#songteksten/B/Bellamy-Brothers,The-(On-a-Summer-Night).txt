  8. ON A SUMMERNIGHT - THE BELLAMY BROTHERS
  
  THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF LIVING
  AND WE'RE GETTING WHAT WE'RE GIVING
  CAN'T YOU SEE THERE'S LOVIN' IN THE AIR
  
  STRANGERS IN PARADISE
  TENDERNESS IN YOUR EYES
  ANGELS OF DARKNESS TAKE CARE
  
  GET ME ROCKIN' GET ME REARIN'
  LET ME FEEL THAT SPECIAL FEELING
  OF LOVING MAKES OUR HEARTS BEAT STRONG
  BABY TOUCH MY SOUL AND LISTEN
  TO THAT EVER LASTING SONG
  
  THEN LET YOUR FEELINGS FIND A WAY
  IT'S OK, ON A SUMMER NIGHT
  IT'S A DAWNING OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS
  AND IT SEEMS
  EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FOR ROMANCE
  
  YOU CAN BLAME IT ON THE STARS ABOVE
  WHEN IT'S LOVE ON A SUMMER NIGHT
  THERE'S A FIRE BURNING DEEP INSIDE
  WE'LL LET IT HAPPEN TONIGHT
  
  BABY WE CAN REALLY MAKE IT
  WE CAN LOOSE IT, FIND IT, TAKE IT
  CAN'T YOU SEE THERE'S MAGIC ALL AROUND?
  
  IT'S ONLY YOU AND ME
  WE CAN FLY HIGH AND FREE
  BABY I WON'T LET YOU DOWN
  
  TELL ME ALL THE DREAMS YOU'RE MISSING
  WE WILL FIND THEM WHILE WE'RE KISSING
  AND WE'LL MAKE THOSE FAIRY TALES COME TRUE
  SO COME CLOSER BABY BLUE EYES
  I'VE GOT LOTS OF LOVE FOR YOU
