MATT BIANCO - DON'T BLAME IT ON THAT GIRL

(Words & music: Matt Bianco)

Little girl, big dreams
Read it in her magazine
Did that girl

Lust for life
Beauty trip
She's set up with all the tricks
Did that girl

In this world
Nobody can blame
You've got to stake your claim
Make use your aim

Don't blame it on that girl
It's the only way she knows
Don't blame it on that girl
She wants a better world

Beauty west
Saving grace
She go far on pretty face
Will that girl

Use it for every need
Guilty on the first degree
Was that girl

In this world
Nobody can blame
You've got to stake your claim
Make use your aim

Don't blame it on that girl
It's the only way she knows
Don't blame it on that girl
She wants a better world
