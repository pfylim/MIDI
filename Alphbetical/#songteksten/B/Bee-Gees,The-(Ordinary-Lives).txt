BEE GEES - ORDINARY LIVES

There'll be one small light
All over the world tonight
The search will go on for the one
It was love with no name
And we glowed in the sun
There was one small dream
Incredible highs and lows
What little we knew
Living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you
Living ordinary lives

Ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
Ordinary people
Living ordinary lives

We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives

The clock on the wall keeps moving
Time stands still
No matter how the dice may fall
Someone else always gets to call the number

Say goodbye cruel world
No pity no pain tonight
Whatever the cost all is lost
If this is love with no name
Then it's all in the stars
Whether it's wrong or right
There's no one to blame no lies
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you
living ordinary lives

We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
What else could we do
Living ordinary lives
Made a dream for you
Living ordinary lives


We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
We were ordinary people
Living ordinary lives
