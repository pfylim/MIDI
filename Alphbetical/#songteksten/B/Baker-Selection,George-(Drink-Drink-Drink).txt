Title  : DRINK DRINK DRINK

La la la la la la
Night after night I'm thinking about you my darling
Night after night does the wine stay close to me
I know it will help me to make it till the next morning
But the next day I am lonely again as can be

And so I drink, drink, drink till the night is gone
Drink, drink, drink till the morning comes
And so I drink, drink, drink, drink till I see the sun
Drink, drink, drink till the hurt is gone

La la la la la la

Night after night after night drinking my darling
Night after night after night hurting my darling
Red wine will help me to make it till the next morning
Red wine will help me to kill all those feelings inside

La la la la la la
