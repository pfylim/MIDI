Singer : ELKIE BROOKS 
Title  : PEARL'S A SINGER

(Words & music: J. Leiber/M. Stoller/R. Dino/J. Sembello)

Pearl's a singer
She stands up when she plays the piano
In a night club
Pearl's a singer
She sings songs for the lost and the lonely
Her job is entertaining folks
Singing songs and telling jokes
In a night club

Pearl's a singer
And they say that she once was a winner
In a contest
Pearl's a singer
Ant they say that she once cut a record
They played it for a week or so
On the local radio
It never made it

She wanted to be Betty Grable
But now she sits there at the beer-stained table
Dreaming of the things she never got to do
All those dreams that never came true
