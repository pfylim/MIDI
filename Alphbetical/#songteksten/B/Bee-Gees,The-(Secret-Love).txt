When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love
--------------------------------------------------------
Sleep pretty baby while you
Wait so long
Livin' with a love that's not just
Make believe
Lonely nights, I see your
Candle glow
And in my mind, I trace
Together we can take away
The time and the space
--------------------------------------------------------
Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart
Is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
--------------------------------------------------------
Anyway you want me I'll be
Standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I
Hunger for
Naked eyes, they watch us
Everywhere
Nowhere to run, I cry
Everything to lose and no alibi
When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love
(Together we can take away the time
And the space)
