                             OB-LA-DI OB-LA-DA

     As performed by: The Beatles   

     Desmond has a barrow in the market place,..
     Molly is the singer in a band.....
     Desmond says to Molly "girl I like your face"
     an' Molly says this as she takes him by the hand.....

     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,..
     la-la how life goes on.....
     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,..
     la-la how their life goes on...

     Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweller's store,...
     buys a twenty carat golden ring..(golden ring)..
     takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
     and as he gives it to her she begins to sing..(sing)...

     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,..
     la-la how their life goes on.....
     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,..
     la-la how their life goes on...hey-ey!..

     In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home........
     with a couple of kids running in the yard..
     of Desmond and Molly Jones.....

     Happy ever after in the market place,..
     Desmond lets the children lend a hand.....
     Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
     an' in the ev'ning she still sings it with the band...yes!

     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,...
     la-la how their life goes on...hey!
     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,...
     la-la how their life goes on.....

     In a couple of years they have built a home, sweet home........
     with a couple of kids running in the yard..
     of Desmond and Molly Jones...hey!

     Happy ever after in the market place,..
     Molly lets the children lend a hand.....
     Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
     an' in the ev'ning she's a singer with the band...yeah!

     Ob-la-di ob-la-da life goes on bra,..
