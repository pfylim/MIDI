Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : HIGHWAY MAN

(Words & music: T. Hiller/M. Lee/L. Sheridan)

Invitation, to a party came for two
Me and you
I was sad when you said that we couldn't go
I agreed to stay home
But then I changed my mind and I went alone
I went as a clown
Nobody knew my plan
Then into the room entered a highway man

Chorus:
Highway man, oh highway man
Stealing kisses where you can
You look so familiar highway man

Chorus: ...

To me full of laughter
He was joking when he said
It's love or your money I'm after
I said please sir I surrender
Then he held me and kissed me and I knew
That he's a pretender
Then midnight arrived he took off his disguise
My heart nearly died
You were before my eyes

Chorus: ...3x...
