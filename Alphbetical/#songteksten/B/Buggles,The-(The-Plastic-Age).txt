Singer : THE BUGGLES
Title  : THE PLASTIC AGE

(Words & music: Horn/Downes)

Everyday my little friend shakes my bed at 6 a.m.
Then the shiny serving clothes running with my telephone
Talking fast I make a deal
Try the fake and tell what's real
What's this pain here in my chest
Maybe I should take a rest

Living in the plastic age
Looking only half my age
Hello doctor red my face
I wish my skin could stand the pace
In my bed I read my mind
Remember how the mice were blind
I watch them hiding in their cage
Could this be the plastic age

They sent the hard-police to put you under
Cardiac arrest and as they drag you through the door
They tell you that you failed the test

Living in the plastic age
Plastic age, plastic age
