
3. BABY, I LOVE YOUR WAY - BIG MOUNTAIN

OOH BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY
EVERY DAY
OOH BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY
EVERY DAY

SHADOWS GROWS SO LONG BEFORE MY EYES
AND THEY'RE MOVING ACROSS THE PAGE
SUDDENLY THE DAY TURNS INTO NIGHT
FAR AWAY FROM THE CITY

BUT DON'T OH NO HESITATE
'CAUSE YOUR LOVE JUST WON'T WAIT

OOH BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY
EVERY DAY
I WANNA TELL YOU I LOVE YOUR WAY
EVERY DAY
I WANNA BE WITH NIGHT AND DAY

THE MOON APPEARS TO SHINE AND LIGHT THE SKY
WITH THE HELP OF SOME FIREFLY
I WONDER HOW THEY HAVE THE POWER TO SHINE AND SHINE
I CAN SEE THEM UNDER THE PINE

BUT DON'T OH NO HESITATE
'CAUSE YOUR JUST WON'T HESITATE

OOH BABY, OOH BABY PLEASE
EVERY DAY YEH YEH
I LOVE I LOVE YOUR WAY
I LOVE I LOVE YOUR WAY
PLEASE

I CAN SEE THE SUNSET IN YOUR EYES
BROWN AND GREY AND BLUE BESIDES
CLOUDS ARE STALKING ISLANDS IN THE SUN
I WISH I COULD BUY ONE OUT OF SEASON
BUT DON'T OH NO NO HESITATE
'CAUSE YOUR LOVE JUST WON'T WAIT OH NO
JUST WON'T WAIT

OOH BABY I LOVE YOUR WAY
EVERY EVERY DAY
I WANNA TELL YOU I LOVE YOUR WAY
I WANNA TELL YOU
I WANNA BE WITH YOU NIGHT AND DAY
NIGHT AND DAY
AND IN EVERY WAY

(REPEAT TO FADE)
