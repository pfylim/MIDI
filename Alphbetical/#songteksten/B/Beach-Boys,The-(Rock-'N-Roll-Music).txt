Title  : ROCK'N'ROLL MUSIC

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man avail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were going like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
The jockey fools they had a jamboree
They're drinking homebrew from a water cup
The folks dancing got a shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to hear a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
