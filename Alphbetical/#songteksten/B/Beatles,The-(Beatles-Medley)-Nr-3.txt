When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Eight days a week, Ilove you
Eight days a week, it's not enough to show I care 
Ain't got  nothing but love babe
Eight days a week, eight days a week

Jo Jo was a man who though he was loner, but he knew it couldn't last 
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson Arizona for some California grass
Get back, get back, get back to where you once belonged 
Get back, grt back in US, back in US, back in USSR

Oh yeah I'll tell you something, I'll think you'll understand 
Then I'll say that something, Iwanna hold your hand
I wanna hold your hand, I wanna hold your hand

Lady Madonna, children at your feet, Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money, when you pay the rent did you think that money was heaven sent
That money was heaven sent

He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of you, knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me - na na na ... hey Jude 

How could I dance with another, uh, when I saw her standing there 

Got to be a joker he just do what he please, Come together, right now, over me

Try to see it my way, Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on
While you see it your way, Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

If there's anything that you want,if there's anything I can do 
Just call on me, and I'll send it along, with love, from me, to you.
