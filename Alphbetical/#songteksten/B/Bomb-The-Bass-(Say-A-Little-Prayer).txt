BOMB THE BASS - SAY A LITTLE PRAYER

The moment I wake up
Before I put on my make-up
I say a little prayer for you
And while combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

Refrain:
Forever and ever
You stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever
We never will part
Oh how I love you 
Together, together
That's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heart-break
for me mmm

I run for the bus dear
while running I think of us dear
i say a little prayer for you
And at work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

refrain: ...

My darling believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me true
Answer my prayer babe

refrain: ...

My darling believe me
For me there is no one but you
Please love me true
Answer my prayer babe
Say you love me too
Answer my prayer babe
Answer it right now babe
Say you love me too
