I go to Spain where I was once before
I wanna see her lovely face once more
She plays the violin
Oh, she really gets me in

Every time I watch her till she ends
I wish I was the violin in her hands
She plays the violin
Oh, she really gets me in

Refrain:
Yes come on gipsy woman
Won't you play me a song
Play it soft sweet and tender
Till the morning has come

It really doesn't matter how I try
The only thing she loves
And that's no lie
It is her violin
Oh, she really gets me in

Refrain: ...

Pretty woman, won't you play me a song
Pretty woman, till the morning has come
Play it soft sweet and tender
Till the morning has come

I go to Spain where I was once before
I wanna see her lovely face once more
She plays the violin
Oh, she really gets me in

Refrain: ...
