Singer : DAVID BOWIE 
Title  : HEROES

(Words & music: David Bowie)

I wish you could swim like dolphins
Like dolphins can swim
Though nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we could be heroes
Just for one day
We can beat them forever and ever

I won't be king, and you
You won't be queen
Though nothing, will drive 'em away
We could be heroes
Just for one day
We could be heroes
Just for one day

I can't remember
I remember standing by the wall
The past shine upon our heads, over our heads
And we kissed saw nothing but fall
Nothing but fall and the shade
Was on the other side
Oh we could be there
Forever and ever
And we could be heroes
Just for one day

We could be heroes

We could be heroes
