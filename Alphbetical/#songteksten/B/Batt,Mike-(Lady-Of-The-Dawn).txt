Title  : LADY OF THE DAWN

(Words & music: Mike Batt)

Chorus:
Lady of the Dawn, you opened up my sleeping eyes
I never knew that I was born
Well, I like you for your body, but I love you 'cause your wise
I am your prisoner, oh, my Lady of the Dawn

You are the dealer
In this strange uncertain game
Take my cards and deal again
I can feel my life is changing
Woman
Now you've taught me how to learn
Teach me to earn
The love you give to me
The love you give to me

Chorus: ...

I was waiting
In the darkness of the night
Only now I see the light
Softly shining in the silence
Woman
If you really hold tehe key
Turn it for me
And help me understand
And help me understand

Chorus: ...
