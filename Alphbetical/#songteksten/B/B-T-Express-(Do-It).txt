Refrain:
Come on and do it do it
Do it till you're satisfied

People know

What ever it is
You get it long as it pleases you
Make it last as long as you can
And when you prove
It's up, to you
We try again

Do it till you're satisfied

Baby how I love
I'm satisfied
I'm satisfied
Baby how I love
Come on and do it
Do it slow
Till you're satisfied
What ever it is
Do it some more
Till you're satisfied
Come on and do it
Till you're satisfied
What ever it is
Do it do it till you're satisfied
Do it do it till you're satisfied
What ever it is
You gotta do it
Do it till you're satisfied
Come on and do it yeah
What ever it is
You gotta do it
I'm gonna give you some more
I'm satisfied (5x)
