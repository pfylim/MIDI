                              E.                   
Just let me hear some of that R & R music

Any old way you choose it
           A.
It's got a back beat you can lose it
E.
any old time you use it
     B.
It's gotta be rock and roll music,
                        E.  B.                      E.
if you wanna dance with me, if you wanna dance with me



                         B.
I've got no kick against modern jazz
                          E. 
unless the try to play it too darn fast
                             A. 
and change the beauty of the melody
                              B.
untill they sound just like a symphony
                          E.
That's why I got for that rock and roll music

     C H O R U S

I took my love one over cross the track
so she can hear my man await a sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man they were going like a hurricane
that's why I got for that R & R music
     
      C H O R U S

Way down South they gave a jubilee
the jocky folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' homebrew from a watercup
the folks dancin' got all shook up
that why I got for that R & R music

      C H O R U S

Don't care to hear them play a tango
I'm in the nm,ood to hear a mambo
It's way to early for the congo,
so keep a rockin' that piano
that why I got for that R & R music
     
      C H O R U S
