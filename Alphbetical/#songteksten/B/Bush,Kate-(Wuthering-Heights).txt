9. WUTHERING HEIGHTS - KATE BUSH

Out on the wiley, windy moors
We'd roll and fall in green.
You had a temper, like my jealousy.
Too hot, too greedy.
How could you leave me?
When I needed to possess you
I hated you, I loved you too.

Bad dreams in the night.
They told me I was going to lose the fight.
Leave behind my wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights.

(Chorus)
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home.
I'm so cold, let me in a your window.
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home.
I'm so cold, let me in a your window.

Oh it gets dark, it gets lonely.
On the other side from you.
I pine alot, I find the lot.
Falls through without you.
I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff.
My only one dream, my only master.

Too long I roam in the night.
I'm coming back to his side to put it right.
I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
Wuthering Heights .                       

(Chorus)

Oh let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
Oh let me have it.
Let me grab your soul away.
You know it's me, Cathy.                 

Chorus

Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home.
I'm so cold 
Heathcliff, it's me, Cathy come home.
I'm so cold
