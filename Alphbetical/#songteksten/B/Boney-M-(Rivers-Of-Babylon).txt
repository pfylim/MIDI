Title  : RIVERS OF BABYLON

(Words & music: B. Dowe/F. McNaughton)

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion (...2x...)

When the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
Now how shall we sing the Lord's song
In a strange land (...2x...)

Let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our hearts
Be acceptable in the sight
Here tonight (...2x...)

By the rivers of Babylon
There we sat down
Yeah, we wept
When we remembered Zion
