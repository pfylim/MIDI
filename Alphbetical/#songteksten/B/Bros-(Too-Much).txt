BROS - TOO MUCH

(Words & music: M. Goss/L. Goss/N. Graham)

Ooh yeah yeah right oh yeah
My head is sore I'm a tortured man
Am I encased in this devil's plan ooh
(Hey) I'm in pain I've been rearranged
My conceptions of love is new
Why am I running running away
From everything I wanted to do

Refrain:
Too much love and I don't wanna lose it
I don't wanna lose it
Don't wanna be lonely like before
All that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you you you la-ah
You you you I don't wanna lose it
You you you la-ah you you you

Escape escape from this ticker tape
God I'm underground oh yeah ooh
A circle's been drawn it's a lonely dawn
Should I pencil in this emptiness
The lesson I've learnt is
Don't run from it so go with it yeah

Refrain: ...

You you you la-ah you you
I don't wanna lose it
You you you la-ah you you

Too much love and I don't wanna lose it
I don't wanna lose it
Don't wanna be lonely like before
All that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you
You you you I don't wanna lose it
Don't wanna be lonely like before
All that I wanna do
Is be madly in love with you
Is be madly in love with you
You you la-ah you you you
I don't wanna lose it
You you you la-ah you you you
