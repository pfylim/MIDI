DAVID BOWIE - THIS IS NOT AMERICA

This is not America
A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom
This season
Promise not to stare
Too long
For this is not the miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have
The faintest idea

Snowmen melting
From the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red
Tomorrow's clouds

A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

This could be the biggest sky
This could be a miracle
This could be ...
