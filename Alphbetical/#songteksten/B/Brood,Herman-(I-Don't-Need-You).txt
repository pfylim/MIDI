Singer : HERMAN BROOD & HIS WILD ROMANCE
Title  : I DON'T NEED YOU

(Words & music: Herman Brood/Danny Lademacher)

She made me act like a smalltown dummy
As I saw her backstage after one night stand
The way she refused me, sure confused me
For quite a while made me insecure, loose my style

Chorus:
She said: I don't need your fancy talk
I don't need for any kind of cover
I don't need your so called love
I don't need you to be my lover

She says: you're just a highschool stud
Tryin' hard to look tough, tryin' hard to relate
To a bitch from the poor side of town
'Cause she looks classic, well, that's what you people say

Chorus: ...2x...

I don't care if you say you love me
I don't care if you spent all all your money for me
As long as you realise
I'm the tiger, you're the monkey
I'm the rat, you're the donkey

Chorus: ...
