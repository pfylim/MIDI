
13. Yellow Submarine - Beatles

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea.

And he told us of his life in
The land of submarines.

So we sailed on to the sun
'Til we found the sea of green.

And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.

And our friends are all aboard;
Many more of them live next door;
And the band begins to play.

As we live a life of ease,
Ev'ry one of us has all we need.
Sky of blue and sea of green,
In our yellow submarine.
