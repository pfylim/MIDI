Title  : I LOVE YOU LIKE I LOVE MYSELF

(Words & music: Eric Strack van Schijndel)

All my friends say I'm a fool
I can stand him hangin' 'round
Didn't see you at the whiskey
Couldn't find you downtown
Margarita
I want you so much
Can't handle myself
Tried to find me another love
But I'm just foolin' myself
I want you
I love you like I love myself
And I don't need nobody else
I know that fancy playboy kind of rock'n'roll
Boyfriend and I mate to see him in town
