Toe to toe dancing very close
Body breathin' almost come a those wall to wall
People hypnotised and they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

Fab five Freddy told me everybody's fly
D j i spinning I said my my flash is fast flash is
Cool fransoirce pa flashe no deau and you don't
stop sure shot go out to the parking lot and get
in your car and drive real far and you drive all
night and then you see a light and it comes
Right down and it lands on the ground and out comes
the man from Mars and you try to run
but he's got a gun and he shoots you dead and
he eats your head and then you're in the man
from Mars ayou go out at night eating cars you
eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too, Mercuries and
Subaru and you don't stop you keep eating cars
then when there's no more cars you go out at
night and eat up bars where the people meet
face to face dance cheek to cheek one to one
man to man dance toe to toe don't move too
slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with
cars he's eating bars yeah wall to wall door to 
door hall to hall he's gonna eat them all rapture
be pure take a tour through the sewer don't
strain your brain paint a train you'll be singing
in the rain baby don't stop do punk rock well
now you see what you wanna be just have your
party on t.v. 'cause the man from Mars won't
eat up bars where the t.v.'s on and now he's
gone back up to space where he won't have to
hassle with the human race and you hip hop
and you don't stop just blast off sure shot 'cause
the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars and
and eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars get down
Back to back sacralilial
Spineless movement and a wild attack
face to face sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture
