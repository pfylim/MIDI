WHITE CHRISTMAS - BERLIN


I'm dreaming for a white Christmas
just like the Christmas ...
when the treetops glisten
and children listen
to hear
sleigh-bells on the snow

I'm dreaming for a white Christmas
with all the Christmas cards I write
may your days be happy and be bright
and may your Christmases be white
