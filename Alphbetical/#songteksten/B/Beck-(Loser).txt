
8. LOSER - BECK

IN THE TIME OF CHIMPANZEES I WAS A MONKEY
DETAINED IN MY VEINS
AND I'M OUT TO CUT THE JUNKIE
A ROOF OF PLASTIC EYEBALLS
SPRAY-PAINT THE VEGETABLES
DOGFOOD SKULLS WITH THE BEEFCAKE PANTYHOSE
KILL THE HEADLIGHTS AND PUT IT IN NEUTRAL
STOCKCAR FLAMING WITH THE LOSER
IN THE CRUISE-CONTROL

BABY'S IN RENO WITH THE VITAMIN TEETH
GOT A COUPLE OF COUCHES
SLEEP ON THE LOVE-SEAT
SOMEONE CAME SAYIN'
I'M INSANE TO COMPLAIN
ABOUT A SHOT-GUN WEDDING
AND A STAIN ON MY SHIRT

DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU BREATHE
YOU GET A PARKING VIOLATION
AND A MAGGOT ON YOUR SLEEVE
SO SHAVE YOUR FACE
WITH SOME MACE IN THE DARK
SAVIN' ALL YOUR FRUITSTANDS
AND BURNIN' DOWN THE TRAILER-PARK

CHORUS:
SO YOU IMPAIR THE DOOR
I'M A LOSER BABY
SO WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME?

THE FORCE OF EVIL
AND A BOZO NIGHTMARE
PAYIN' ALL THE MUSIC
WITH THE PHONY GAS CHAMBER
'CAUSE ONE'S GOT A WEASEL
AND THE OTHER'S GOT A FLAG
ONE'S ON THE POLE
SHOVE THE OTHER IN THE BAG

WITH THE RE-RUN SHOWS
AND THE COCAINE NOSE-JOB
ALL THE CRAP OF THE FOLK-SINGER SLOP
HE HUNG HIMSELF WITH THE GUITAR STRING
A SLAB OF TURKEY NECK
AND IT'S HANGING FROM THE PIGEON WING

SO GET RIGHT IF YOU CAN'T RELATE
TRADE THE CASH FOR THE BEAT
FOR THE BODY, FOR THE HATE
AND MY TIME IS A PIECE OF WAX
FALLING ON A TERMITE
WHO'S CHOKING ON THE SPLINTERS

CHORUS
