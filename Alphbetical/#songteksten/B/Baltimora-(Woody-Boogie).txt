BALTIMORA - WOODY BOOGIE

Every time she looks at me
I can feel electric heat, alright, alright
Shine a sparkle in her eyes
And she's moving in disguise, alright, alright
I am losing my control
Maybe time to take a hold, tonight, alright
But I'm spinning all around
Don't know if I'm up or down, I'm on fire

Ohoh breaking up the night ohoh
Shaking up the night oooh
Breaking up the night oooh
Come on it's time to hit the floor ooh
You can be sure, you don't get bored

Refrain:
Woody Woody boogie
Woody Woody boogie
Woody get down tonight
Woody get down tonight
We're on the go

Refrain: ...

People jumping in the air
Going crazy everywhere, alright, alright
I keep staring at her face
As the clock begins to race, alright, alright
