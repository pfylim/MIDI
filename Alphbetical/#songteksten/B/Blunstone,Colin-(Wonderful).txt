Title  : COLLIN BLUNSTONE 
Singer : WONDERFUL

I can see the bright line
Of the run-way light shine
Coming on the night flight
From out the sky

Sitting here in silver wings
Hear the engines thundering
Hanging there so easily
Above the lights of home
I need you more than ever
Now my love
Ooh watch the lights of the city
Draw me to your name

Wonderful, wonderful
You're my lady wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
Run to me my lady wonderful

Will you see me touch down
On the numbers turn 'round
On the flight arrivals
High in the hall
I will wait impatiently
Knowing you're not far from me
Try and catch a look at you
Through the customs wall

I want you more than ever
Now my love
There's nothing more than a word
holding us apart

Wonderful, wonderful
You're my lady wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
Run to me my lady wonderful
