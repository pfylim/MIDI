Title  : Island Of Lost Souls
Singer : Blondie


In Babylon
On the boulevard of broken dreams
My love will power at the lowest ebb
Oh what can I do

Oh buccaneer can ya help me put my truck in gear
Can ya take me far away from here
Save my soul from sin

You wanna get away you've had it man
Nothin's going right
So come sit on the sands of the island
Island of Lost Souls

No luxuries no no amenities too dull
Your senses Oh Oh only primitive hey hey
Really get away, is what he said

Chorus:
Where did he go? I'm tired of waiting here of him
Where can he be? He's not with me
Where did he go? What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?

The sky is blue the ssea is warm and clear
And golden sands are calling out to you inviting
Make a new man out a you

You can come for a while come with a friend
Forget about work start all over again
Let the real you throug here's what we do

Chorus

No luxuries no no amenties too dull your senses
Oh Oh only primitive hey hey really get away
Island of Lost Souls
Ayya ayya ayya Island of Lost Souls
