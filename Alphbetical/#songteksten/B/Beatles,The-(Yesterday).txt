12. YESTERDAY - BEATLES

Vers 1:
Yesterday - all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as if they're here to stay,
oh, I believe in yesterday.

Vers 2:
Suddenly - I'm not half the man I used to be,
there's a shoadow hanging over me,
oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Refrain:
Why  she  had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said: Something wrong, now I long  for yesterday.

Vers 3:
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away,
oh, I believe  in yesterday.

Refrain:
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said: Something wrong, now I long  for yesterday.

Vers 4 (wie Vers 3):
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.
Now I need a place to hide away,
oh, I believe in yesterday.

Mmh mmh mmh  mmh mmh-mmh-mmh.
