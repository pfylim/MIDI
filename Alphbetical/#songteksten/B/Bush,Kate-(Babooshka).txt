Babooshka, Babooshka
She wanted to test her husband
She knew exactly what to do
A pseudonym to fool him
She couldn't have made a worse move
She sent him scented letters
And he received them with a strange delight
Just like his wife
But how she was before the tears
And how she was before the years flew by
And how she was when she was beautiful
She signed the letter
All yours, Babooshka, Babooshka, Babooshka
Ya ya ya ya ya ya

Babooshka, Babooshka
She wanted to take it furhter
So she arranged a place to go
For to see if he would fall for her incognito
And when he laid eyes on her
He got the feeling they had met before
Uncanny how she reminds him of his little lady
Capacity to give him all she needs
Just like his life before she freezed on him
Just like the wife when she was beautiful
She shouted it out: I'm all yours
Babooshka, Babooshka
Ya ya ya ya ya
