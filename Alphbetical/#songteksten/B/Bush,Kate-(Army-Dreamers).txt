Title  : ARMY DREAMERS
Artist : KATE BUSH

(Words & music: Kate Bush)

Our little Army boy
Is coming home from B.F.P.O.
I've a bunch of purple flowers
To decoreate a mammy's hero
Mourning in the aerodrome
The weather warmer, he is colder
Four men in uniform to carry home
My little soldier

Chorus:
What could he do?
Should have been a rock star
But he didn't have the money for a guitar
What could he do?
Should have been a politician
But he never had a proper education
What could he do?
Should have been a father
But he didn't even make it to his twenties
What a waste
Army dreamers

Tears o'er a tin box
Oh Jesus Christ, he wasn't to know
Like a chicken with a fox
He cannot win the war with ego
Give the kid the pick of pips
And give him all your stripes and ribbons
Now he's sitting in his hole
He might as well have buttons and bows

Chorus: ...
