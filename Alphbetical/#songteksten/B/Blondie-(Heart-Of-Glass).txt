Title  : HEART OF GLASS

(Words & music: Debbie Harry/Chris Stein)

Once I had a love, and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Once I had a love, and it was divine
Soon found out I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

In between what I find is pleasing
And I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's no good
You teasing like you do

Once I had a love, and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind

Lost inside adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using
Please don't push me aside
We coulda made it cruisin' yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

Once I had a love, and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing only to find
Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind
