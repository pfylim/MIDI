Title  : Walking On The Chinese Wall
Singer : Philip Bailey


Walking on a Chinese wall (2x)
Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall
Butterfly spread your painted wings
For an answer form the Ching
By the stream stretching in the rocks
Tigers on the mountain top

Chorus:
Walking on the Chinese wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak
Three misty nights waiting by the shore
Maybe that my lover comes no more
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tale of hidden Chinese love

Chorus

Blue red silk burning on m chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me
Come down the clouds to the sea of flames
From the mountain hear the cry of pain
Red chamber dream from the sky above
Ancient tale of hidden Chinese love

Chorus
