Hi, I'm Marianne
And I'm Nancy Dee
Oh yes, gonna have good fun

Oh, dance
Yeah, come on then, are you ready?
Dance!
I feel like dancin' all night
Let's dance, dance the night away
Dance, dance, dance the night away

Chorus:
Switch
Switch
Turn the switch
Switch
Of my fire, take me higher
To a place no one's seen
To a song in a dream

Chorus: ...

See how rich my desire
Will be only for you
When we dance the whole night through

Chorus: ...

Make the wish of desire
For the music to play
While we dance the night away

Dance!
Oh, well, oh well, oh well (3x)

Switch me over, yeah
Switch me over, ooh

Take me out there, get me dancing to the beat
Let's get going to the movement in our feet

Oh Dance

Chorus: ...

I'm on fire, with desire
For the song turns me on
Makes me want to dance along

Chorus: ...

Make me wish, to get higher
Then to be just with you
As we dance the whole night through

Switch me over, yeah
Switch me over, ooh

Take me out there, get me dancing to the beat
Let's get going to the movement in our feet

Switch me over
Oh, tell me, tell me
Switch me over
Ooh, ooh
Tell me, brother
Tell the sun
Just switch
