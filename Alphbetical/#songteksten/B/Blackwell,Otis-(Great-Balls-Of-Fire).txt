You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain,
too much love drives a man in sane.
You broke my will, but what a thrill.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire !

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny.
You came along and moved me, honey.
I changed my mind, this love is fine.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire !

Kiss me, baby, oh, yo !
It feels good.
Hold me, baby.
I want to love you like a lover should.
You're fine, so kind.
I'm gonna tell the world that you're 
mine, mine, mine, mine.

I chew my nails and I twiddle my thumbs,
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun !
Oh, baby, you're drivin' me crazy.
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire !
