BERLIN - TAKE MY BREATH AWAY

Watchin' every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, fin'lly lovers know to shame
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Refrain:
Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn to me and say

Refrain: ...

Through the hour glass I saw you
In time, you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turn to hear you say
If only for today I am unafraid

Refrain: ...

Watching every motion in thicks foolish lovers game
Haunted by the notion somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn my way and say

Refrain: ...

My love, take my breath away,
My love, take my breath away,
