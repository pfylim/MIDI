Title  : DON'T SAY GOODBYE

(Words & music: Tol/Tuyp/Keizer/Tol)

The love we had, it makes me sad
To tell her soon my ship will be on her way
To bring me home again
And leave the good times that we had

I hear today, you sail away
And leave me here
With nothing but memories
Tonight's our last embrace
Then I won't see you anymore

Blown by the wind
My ship is comin' through
Only the wind
May bring me back to you

Then we make love
Like we always did before
Just like tonight
When you're knocking on my door
Ce soir, Madame, ce soir, Monsieur

I'm gonna miss you night and day
Please stay, don't say goodbye
Makin' me lonely till I die

A seagull flies
The deep blue sky
Don't leave me here
With nothing but memories
Tonight's our last embrace
Then I won't see you anymore
