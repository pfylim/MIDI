BROS - I OWE YOU NOTHING

(Words & music: Tom Watkins/Nicky Graham)

I'll watch you crumble
Like a very old wall (ooh)
I'll see you stranded (yeah)
You took me for a fool (ooh)
I'll have my revenge (ooh, ooh yeah)
'Cos I owe you nothing
Nothing at all

I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, nothing
Nothing at all

I'll watch you suffer
With no feelings
No feelings at all (ooh)
I'll see you desperate (yeah)
You won't hear my call
He who laughs last (ooh, ooh yeah)
Owes you sweet nothing
Nothing at all

I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, nothing
Nothing at all

I was yours and you were mine
But you ran around and told me lies
You got big, big trouble

I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, nothing
Nothing at all

I owe you nothing, nothing at all
I owe you nothing, nothing
Nothing at all
