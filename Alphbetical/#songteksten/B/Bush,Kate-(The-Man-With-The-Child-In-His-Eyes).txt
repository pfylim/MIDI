Title  : THE MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES

(Words & music: Kate Bush)

I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man

They think he's lost on some horizon
And suddenly I find myself list'ning to a man
I've never known before
Telling me about the sea, all his love  till eternity

Ooh, he's here again, the man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again, the man with the child in his eyes

He's very understanding
He's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late he's always waiting
But I feel him hesitate
Oh, I'm so worried about my man

They say, no, no it won't last forever
And here I am again, my girl
Wondering what on earth I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't love me
I just took a trip on my love for him

Ooh, he's here again, the man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again, the man with the child in his eyes
