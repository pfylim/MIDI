DANGER ZONE - BLACK SABBATH


1) Revin' up your engine listen to her howlin roar
   metal under tension beginn' you to touch and go

Refrain: Highway to the danger zone
         ride into the danger zone

2) Headin' into twilight 
   spreadin' out her wings tongight
   she got you jumpin' off the deck
   and shovin' into overdrive

Refrain: Highway to the danger zone
         i'll take you right into the danger zone

3) You'll never say hello to you
   until you get it on the red line overload
   you'll never know what you can do
   until you get it up as high as you can do

Refrain: Out along the edges
         always where i burn to be
         the furthewr on the edge
         the hotter the intensity
