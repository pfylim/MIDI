BROS - I QUIT

(Words & music: Bros)

Ooh eh eh ooh eh eh
Ooh eh eh ooh eh eh
Eeh eeh yeah it's oh too much
Most of my friends were strangers
When I met them
Familiarity breeds contempt
Ooh ooh yeah
Well I'm better alone
Then in company
So get out stay out of my life
I'm at the point yeah
I'm at the point where I quit oh
I've had enough yeah
I've had it right up to here
Now I'm taking a break ooh
I quit yeah I said I quit yeah
With this view
And that new opinion
When I see them ooh
I don't need another
Pain in the neck oh oh
Well nobody listens to losers
So when you're surrounded by fools
Who needs another
Who needs another clever dick yeah
I've had enough yeah
I've had it right up to here
Now I'm taking a break ooh
I quit, I quit oh oh ah yeah
Ooh eh eh ooh eh eh
Ooh eh eh ooh eh eh
Ooh eh eh ooh eh eh
Oh woh oh oh oh
I've quit yeah
I've had enough I've had enough
I've had it right up to here
Now I'm taking a break ooh
I quit yeah
I said I've had it right up to here
Now I'm taking a break ooh ooh
