Title  : SATURDAY NIGHT

(Words & music: D. Lademacher)

The neon light of the open all night
Was just in time replaced
By magic appearance
Of a new day, while melancholic Reno
Was crawling on his back
Just in front of the supermarket doorway
On a cold night, as we stood on the corner
As a man passed by and asked us
What we were doing
What we need as he pointed his big fat finger
At the people hanging round on the corner
At the other side of the street

Doing nothing, just hanging round
What do you mean doing nothing son
So we had to hit him to the ground
Doing nothing, just hanging round
His head all busted
Looking just a bit too wise
I just can't wait, I just can't wait
For saturday night

Beautiful soul music chirping out of the jukebox
Chicks dressed to kill
Surrounded by the boys like bees on the honey
Some do, some don't, some never will

Saturday night
Just can't wait

Neon light
Chirping out of the jukebox
Melancholic Reno
Just in time replaced
By the beautiful soul chicks
Doin' nothing
Saturday night
Just can't wait
Saturday night
