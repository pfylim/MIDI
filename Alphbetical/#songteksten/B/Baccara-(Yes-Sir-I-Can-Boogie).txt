13. YES SIR, I CAN BOOGIE - BACCARA

Mister your eyes are full of hesitation
Sure makes me wonder if you know 
what you're lookin' for
Baby I wanna keep my reputation
I've a sensation 
You drive me wild as you beg for more
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
No sir I don't feel very much like talkin'
No neither walking you wanna know if I can dance
Yes sir already told you in the first words
And in the chorus
But I will give you one more chance
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
But I need a certain song
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
Yes Sir I Can Boogie
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
If you stay you can't go wrong
I can boogie boogie boogie all night long
