Chorus:
Belfast, Belfast
When the country rings 
The livin' bell you're lost
Belfast, Belfast
When the hate you have
For one another's past
You can try, you can try
You can try, you can try
To tell the world, the reason why
Belfast, Belfast, Belfast

It's the country that's changin'
It's the country that's changin'
It's the country that's changin'
All the people

It's the world that's deceivin'
It's the world that's deceivin'
It's the world that's deceivin'
All the people
'Cause the people believin'

When the children believin'
All the people
'Cause the people are leavin'
When the people are leavin'
When the people are leavin'
When the people are leavin'
All the children
'Cause the children believin'
