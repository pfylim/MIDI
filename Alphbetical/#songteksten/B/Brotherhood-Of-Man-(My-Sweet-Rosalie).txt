Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : MY SWEET ROSALIE

It was late, I didn't have a special date
I was sitting on a parkbench by the lake
I heard a cry, and a very much to my surprise
Someone kissed me, made me open up my eyes
I turned around to solve this mystery
And who d'ya think was sittin' next to me

My sweet Rosalie, though she always plays around
She never brings me down, my sweet Rosie
Sweet Rosalie, she is always full of fun
I'm the only one for my Rosie, my sweet Rosie

We started home
It was almost time for tea
It's been a good day for me and Rosalie
It's fun together 'cause we're such a perfect pair
And when I want her I know she's always there
She's everything a guy could ever need
I love her, oh I love her yes indeed

My sweet Rosalie, though she always plays around
She never brings me down, my sweet Rosie
Sweet Rosalie, she is always full of fun
I'm the only one for my Rosie, my sweet Rosie
I'm the only one for my Rosie, my sweet Rosie

She's the only one for me
The cutest little puppy dog you'll see
