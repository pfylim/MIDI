Title  : THE KISS
Artist : BABE

(Words & music: Peter Koelewijn)

Put your hands on your back
Shuffle on the beat
Close your eyes and kiss

Sha la la, sha la la lee
Viva los hombres
Sha la la, sha la la lee
Viva los hombres

Do the kiss with both eyes closed
Yes I kiss with both eyes closed
Do you like the long kiss most
Yes I like the long kiss most
Are you ready do it now
Or ask your boy to show you how
Do the kiss with both eyes closed
Yes I kiss with both eyes closed

Sha la la, sha la la lee
Kiss me
Sha la la, sha la la lee
Kiss me

You need a boy or you need a man
(Viva los hombres)
You need rhythm, you need a band
(Viva los hombres)
Do it a minute, or as long as you can
(Viva los hombres)
All together, don't be shy
Come on girls, stand by

Do it in London, Rome and Madrid
(Viva los hombres)
No boy refuses, all boys admit
(Viva los hombres)
Everybody here is doing it
(Viva los hombres)
All together don't be shy
Come on girls, stand by

Put your hands on your back that's nice
Shuffle on the beat close your eyes 
And do the kiss
