ROBIN BECK - THE FIRST TIME

First time, first love
Oh, what feeling is this?
Electricity flows with the very first kiss
Like a break in the clouds, 
in the first ray of the sun
I can feel it inside
Something new has begun
And it's taken control of my body and mind
It began when I heard 'I love you'

For the very first time
For the very first time
For the very first time
For the very first time
And baby

This live, this love
Oh, the sweetness I feel
so mysterious yet so incredible real
It's an unchartered sea
It's an unopened door
But ya gotta reach out and ya gotta explore
Even though you're not sure
till the moment arrives
There he is
And you know you're in love
For the very first time
For the very first time

When I met you
Ev'ry feeling I had was new
I don't think there are words to
describe the sensation
Oh no, no, no
For the very first time

It's an unchartered sea
It's an unopened door
But ya gotta reach out and ya gotta explore
And when something happens that words can't define
Only then so you know you're in love
For the very first time
For the very first time
For the very first time
