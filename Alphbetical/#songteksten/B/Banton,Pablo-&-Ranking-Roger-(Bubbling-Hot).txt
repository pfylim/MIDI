Just like a soup in a pot, we bubbling hot
Hm, they miss a Banton regunant stopper
along with Raking Roger, the unified ragga
who believe in a love-night, fighting one another.
We're gonna' in this bottle with all, that we got
So listen to the lyriks, we are prefind the chakka
It's no matter if you're slim, it's no matter if you're fat
Need no matter if you´re poor, because you wanna' get hot

We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot
Bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot
Yes, just like a soup in a pot
We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot
Long
We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot

Run, Roger!

`Cause his name is Banton and my name is Roger
we two are we together like a bird and a feather
Get up by a catch, no time to relax
'Cause when we come together you understand the chat
We're telling you big bubble come in, find the double
This is another rear yet to keep you what a trouble
So whether you are white, or whether you are black
You feel rockin' nonstop, because we two are real rapper

We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot
Bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot
Yes, just like a soup in a pot
We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot

We bubbling hot, hot, hot, we bubbling hot

Go there!
Hot, ho-hot, hot

Oh, we rock the short, yes we rock the tall
Uh, we rock the big, yes we rock the small
In the dancehall we rock them all
Yes Banton and Roger, we rap them all

The short, the tall, we rock them all
The big, the small, we rock them all
The white, the black, we rockin' them all
The slim and the fat, we rock them all
The weak, the strong, we rock them all
The old and young, we rock them all
The women and men, we rock them all
All, because

We bubbling
