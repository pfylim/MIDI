Singer : BEE GEES 
Title  : STAYIN' ALIVE

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin/Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
The music's loud and women wamr
I've been kicked around since I was born
And now it's all right, it's o.k.
And you may look the other way

Chorus:
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody's shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah ha ha ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah ha ha ha, stayin' alive

Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose
You know it's all right, it's o.k
I'll live to see another day

Chorus: ...

Life's goin' nowhere
Somebody help me, somebody help me yeah
Life's goin' nowhere
Somebody help me, yeah, stayin' alive
