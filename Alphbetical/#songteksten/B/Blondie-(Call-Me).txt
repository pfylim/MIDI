Colour me your colour baby
Colour me your car
Colour me your colour darling
I know who you are
Come up off your colour chart
I know where you're coming from
Call me on the line
Call me, call me any-anytime
Call me, oh love
You can call me any day and night
Call me

Cover me with kisses
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi
Call me on the line
Call me, call me any-anytime
Call me oh love
When you're ready we can share the wine
Call me

He speaks the languages of love
Amore chia-mami, chiamami
Appel moi, mon cherie, appel moi
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, anyway
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere, any day

Call me on my line
Call me. call me any-anytime
Call me for a ride
Call me for some overtime
call me, call me on my line
call me, call me and a sweet design
Call me, call me
For your lover's alibi
Call me on my line
Call me, call me any-anytime, call me.
