Title  : LET YOUR LOVE FLOW

There's a reason for the sunshine sky
There's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the season when that love light shines
All around us

So let that feeling
Grab you deep inside
And send your reeling
Where your love can't hide
And then go stealing
Through the summer nights
With your lover

Let your love flow
Like a mountain stream
Let your love grow
With the smallest of dreams
And let your love show
And you'll know what I mean 
It's the season

Let your love fly
Like a bird on the wing
Let your love bind you
To all living things
And let your love shine
And you'll know what I mean
It's the season
