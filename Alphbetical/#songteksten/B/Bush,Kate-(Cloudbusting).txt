KATE BUSH - CLOUDBUSTING

I still dream of organon
I wake up crying
You're making rain
And you're just in reach
When you and sleep escape me

You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark
What made it special
Made it dangerous
So I bury and forget

Every time it rains
You're in my head
Like the sun coming out
Ooh, I just know that something
good is going to happen
And I don't know when
But just saying it could even
make it happen

On top of the world
Looking over the edge
You could see them coming
You looked to small
In their big black car
To be a threat to the men
in power

I hid my yo-yo in the garden
I can't  hide you from the
government
Oh God, daddy - I won't forget

Your son's coming out
