PAT BENATAR - WE BELONG

Twenty times I've tried to tell you
Twenty times I've cried alone
Always I'm surprised how well you
Cut my feelings to the bone
Don't want to leave you really
Just want to break the ice
Do I look silly to you
When I yield to your advise
When you say

Refrain:
We belong to the light
We belong to the thunder
We belong to the sound of the words
We've both fallen under
Whatever we deny or embrace
For worse or for better
We belong (we belong) we belong
We belong together

Maybe it's a sign of weakness
When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
How we've become a habit
How we distort the facts
Now there's no looking forward
Now there's no turning back
Still you say

Refrain: ...

Close your eyes and try to sleep now
Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try to wash the palette clean
We can begin to know it
How much we really care
But I hear your voice inside me
And see your face everywhere
I can say

Refrain: ...
