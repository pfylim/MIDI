Ma-til-da Ma-til-da
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela
Fivethousand dollars friend I lost
woman even take me cart and host
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela

Well the money was just inside me bed
stuck up in the pillow beneath me head
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela
Ma-til-da Ma-til-da
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela

Well, me friends never to love again
all me money gone in vain
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela
Ma-til-da Ma-til-da
Matilda she take me money and run Venezuela
