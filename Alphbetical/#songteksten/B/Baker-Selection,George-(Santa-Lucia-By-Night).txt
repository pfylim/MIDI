        Santa Lucia by night              George Baker Selection


Catch a falling star, and tell me you love me,
Say you love me, tell me you love me.
Hold it in your hand and say that you need me, the words I wanna hear.

Lonelyness a road I left far behind me, far behind me, so far behind me.
Happiness comes in my life if you want me, so give it all to me.

Do you wanna stay, my love, do you wanna stay, my love,
Underneath the stars above?

Santa Lucia by night - romantic feelings under the starry light.
No more worries, no more troubles to care,
It's love that we share, it's love that we share.

Santa Lucia by night - sail on the wings of love when you hold me tight.
There's a place for you and I in this time,
If you will be mine, if you will be mine.

Come and sing this happy melody,
Sing it with your soul, it makes you free.
Listen to the music of your heart,
In the Italian night we can be alright.

Santa Lucia by night - romantic feelings under the starry light.
No more worries, no more troubles to care,
It's love that we share, it's love that we share.

Catch a falling star and tell me you love me, ...
Do you wanna stay, my love, do you wanna stay, my love, ...
Come and sing this happy melody, ...
Santa Lucia by Night - romantic feelings under the starry light ...
No more worries, no more troubles to care,
It's love that we share, it's love that we share.
In the morning till the night.
