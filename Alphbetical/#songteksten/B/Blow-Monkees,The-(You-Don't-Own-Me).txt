Title  : You Don't Own Me
Singer : The Blow Monkeys


You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please when I go out with you
Don't put me on display 'cause

You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down
'Cause I'll never stay

I don't tell you what to say
And I don't tell you what to do 
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you

I'm young and I love to be young
Free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please
