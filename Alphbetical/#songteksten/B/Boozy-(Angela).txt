Like a teardrop from a flower
Like the honey from a bee
You give strength to me and power
Can't you see, can't you see

You're the one I try to find
You're the answer you're the kind
As a dream of nights, night and day
Can't you see

When you came on earth that evening
I knew that you had to be
The reality of dreaming
Can't you see, can't you see

Angela, girl of my dreams
You were mine, sweet little baby
You were mine
