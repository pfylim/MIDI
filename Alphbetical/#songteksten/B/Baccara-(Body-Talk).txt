I like him
I even think I could love him
but why is he so shy
maybe I should tell him.

I know your secret
yopu're trying to hide it, boy, but I got proof
'coz I can read it
by what you're doing and the way you move.

You wanna touch me
don't use your elbow, use your hand my friend
but not too much, we,
we've got all night, now try and be a gent
d'you understand ?

Oh, body-talk
gimme some more body-talk
so I can read
what you want and what you need
now move it loud
let it all hang out and out
body-talk is fun, fun, fun
it's number one, one, one
oh, body-talk
gimme some more body-talk
please go on and dance
give yourself another chance
now move it loud
let it all hang out and out
it's a power-high, high, high
oh, mio my, my, my.

This conversation
is getting closer to the point
congratulations
I must admit, I'm really glad I've joined
well, I can feel it
there's not a single word I wanna miss
now we should seal it
may I suggest to use a tender kiss
goes like this.

Oh, body-talk,...

the most enchanting language to be known
but you can't use it on the telephone
some never learn it, some are far too slow
but honey, now I know.

Oh, body-talk,...

I can read your body-talk
I can read the way you walk
honey, you don't have to shout
'coz your body's talking loud.
