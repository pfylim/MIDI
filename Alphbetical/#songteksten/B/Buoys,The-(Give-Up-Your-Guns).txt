Singer : THE BUOYS
Title  : GIVE UP YOUR GUNS

(Words & music: Rupert Holmes/Danny Jordan)

When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
But she was gone, she was gone
And there beside the pillow
Where her tears from the night before
She said: Give up your guns and face the law

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail
Within the glades, so I ran
And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me once more
She said: Give up your guns and face the law

I don't wanna leave her
I don't wanna die
Deep within a cold, cold grave
With no one round to cry
But I've got my pistol, now it's time to choose
Shooting her or hanging there and either way I lose

And now I'm in this cabin
Where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note, she wrote to me
And it says: Though you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as death can die
My love, give up your guns or say goodbye, goodbye
And the sherrif now is calling
With his shotgun at my door
Son give up your guns and face the law
