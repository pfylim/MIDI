
2. Barbados - TYPICALLY TROPICALLY

Wow I'm giong to Barbados
Funny and pretty countries
I'm going to see my girlfriend
In the sunny Caribbean sea

I don't wanna be bus driver all my life
I've seen too much of Brixton town in the night
Fly away on a coconut airplane, fly in high Barbados skies
I look up at the skies and I see the clouds
I look down at the ground and I see the rainbow down the gray

Far away from London town and the rain
It's really really nice to be here again
Mary jane with a coconut airplane
How I know she loves me so

Wow I'm giong to Barbados
Funny and pretty countries
I'm going to see my girlfriend
In the sunny Caribbean sea (2x To Fade)
