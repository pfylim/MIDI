Title  : MY MALAYSIA
Artist : BABE

(Words & music: Peter Koelewijn)

My Malaysia, selamat tinggal, selamat tinggal
'Til we meet again
My Malaysia, I hear the drums call, I hear the drums call
Yes, we'll meet again
My Malaysia, high on the mountains
I'll see the fires to show me the way
Let them burn, 'til my return

Did you ever smell the rains when the monsoon blows?
Then the bunga-raya flowers go asleep
That is where the sea embraces the golden coast
And guitars and gamelan softly weep
Darling, my darling, my ku-kash-ku
I miss the sun, but boy, I miss you most
My love for you is true and deep

On the pinang-beach he smiled at me
He sold white orchids on that place
The son of the sun, he seemed to be
A blue-jeans prince with an ebony face
Darling, my darling, my ku-kash-ku
My Malaysian dream, wait for me
I still feel the toiuch of your warm embrace
