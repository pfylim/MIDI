Title  : LOVE IN OUR HEARTS

(Words & music: Peter Brown/R.Rans)

Well you got to clap your hands
It's a long way to heaven
You can't let living weigh you down
As far as I'm concerned
It ain't no good for nothing
To worry 'bout where you're bound

Well, you got to be a friend
To your brothers and sisters
You got to help them see the light
As far as they're concerned
Life is a journey in darkness
Your love will shine them through the night

Chorus:
And we got love love love in our hearts tonight
We got love in our hearts

Well there's got to be a way
We can help one another
Don't have to face the world alone
You got to hold the hand
Of someone who needs you
And help them on their journey home

You got to close your eyes to see tomorrow
Imagine what the future could be
And should you be concerned
'Bout the way things are going
Then make it only love that you see

Chorus: ...2x...
