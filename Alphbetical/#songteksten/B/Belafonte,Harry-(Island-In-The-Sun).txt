  7. ISLANDS IN THE SUN - H.BELAFONTE
  
  This is my island in the sun
  Where my people have toiled
  Since time begun
  I may sail on many a sea
  Her shores will always be home to me.
  
  
  Oh, island in the sun
  Willed to me 
  By my father's hand
  All my days 
  I will sing in praise
  Of your forest, waters
  Your shining sand.
  
  As morning breaks 
  The heaven on high
  I lift my heavy load 
  To the sky
  Sun comes down 
  With a burning glow
  Mingles my sweat
  With the earth below.
  
  Oh, island in the sun
  Willed to me 
  By my father's hand
  All my days 
  I will sing in praise
  Of your forest, waters
  Your shining sand.
  
  I see woman
  On bended knee
  Cutting cane for her family
  I see man 
  At the water's side
  Casting nets at the surging tide.
  
  Oh, island in the sun
  Willed to me 
  By my father's hand
  All my days 
  I will sing in praise
  Of your forest, waters
  Your shining sand.
  
  I hope the day 
  Will never come
  That I can't awake
  To the sound of drum
  Never let me miss Carnival
  The Calypso songs play a soft recall.
  
  Oh, island in the sun
  Willed to me 
  By my father's hand
  All my days 
  I will sing in praise
  Of your forest, waters
  Your shining sand.
  
  Mmmm...
