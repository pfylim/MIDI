8. LET THE DREAM COME TRUE - DJ BOBO

Refrain:
Not a broken heart, now we gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you
Let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true

Rap 1:
Kick it, tip it, flip it, sip it
Shake your body 'round, get wicked
Use the door get on the floor
I still got more for you to store
Get on your feet, it's treated unique
Just feel the heat and get back to the beat
Rube dup, rube dup, rube dup, rube dup
Jump and shake your body, wine it up
Everybody shake your body
D.J. Bobo starts the party
Up and down, here we go
Don't look back, just let it flow
Up and down, don't loose your crown
What goes up must come once down
Now hold tight, everything's alright
There's no need to fight tonight

Refrain

Rap 2:
It's a break, I don't mean a fake
Open your ears, it's not a mistake
Then music is strong and I made these rhymes
Partytime 'cause the time is mine
So let's go down, down on the floor
I wanna give you what you are waitin' for
You know what you want
And you want it know
You know what you want
When you hear the sound
Swing your body and have some fun
Now you're on the run
This track has just begun
It's done for fun and hits you like a gun
Jump up and down, toss and turn
Right to the ground before you burn
Pump the bass right in your face
Just in case we start the race

Refrain

First I waited, then created
Didn't debate it, just made it
The feeling is strong, so keep coming on
With the bass and the drums
There's nothing wrong
Now get on up, take your shoes
Swing your body,  get wild and loose
One, two, three, four, tippin' and tappin'
Slippin' and slappin' there's no stoppin'
It's friday night, the time is right
Enjoy the vibe just like a tribe
Take the groove and move it smooth
Breakin' it down just for the groove
Kick the steps, but watch your neck
Before you get wreck I will come correct
This sensation, no violation
Just influential for the party nation
