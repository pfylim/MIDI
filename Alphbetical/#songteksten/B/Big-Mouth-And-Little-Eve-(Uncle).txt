Singer : BIG MOUTH & LITTLE EVE 
Title  : UNCLE

Didn't get your love
Uncle uncle uncle
All the words you said
Uncle uncle uncle

Took me up and took me down
And you used me as a clown
I just wanted to get a little higher

I say how are you now
Uncle, you should know by now
That I ain't the same anymore
I say how are you now
This one here is the one I'm living for

I'm living for
I'm living for
I say how are you now
Uncle, you should know by now
That I'm living with the one I adore
