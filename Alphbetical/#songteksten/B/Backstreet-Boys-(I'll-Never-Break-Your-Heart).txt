6. I`LL NEVER BREAK YOUR HEART - BACKSTREET BOYS

Baby I know you are hurting.
I know you feel like
You can never love again.
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you.

From the first day
That I saw your smiling face.
Honey I knew that we would be
Together forever.
Ooh when I asked you out
You said no but I forgot I would
Darling that you`d been hurt.
You felt that you`d never love again.

I deserve a try honey.
Just once.
Give me a chance
And I`ll prove this all wrong.
You walked in
You where so quick to judge.
But honey it`s nothing like me.

Chorus
I`ll never break your heart.
I`ll never make you cry.
I`d rather die than live without you.
I`ll give you all of me.
Honey that`s no lie.
I`ll never break your heart.
I`ll never make you cry.
I`d rather die than live without you.
I`ll give you all of me.
Honey that`s no lie.

As time goes by
You will get to know me.
Believe it get`s better.
Girl that`s the way love goes.
Baby, baby.

And I know you`re afraid.
To let your fellings show.
And I understand.
Girl it`s time to let go.

I deserve a try honey.
Just once.
Give me a chance
And I`ll prove this all wrong.
You walked in
You where so quick to judge.
But honey it`s nothing like me.
Darling why can`t you see.

Chorus

I`ll never break your heart.
No way no way
No how make you cry.
I swear.
No way. No how. I

Chorus repeat and fade out
