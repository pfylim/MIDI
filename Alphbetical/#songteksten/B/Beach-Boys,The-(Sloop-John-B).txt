SLOOP JOHN B - BEACH BOYS


We Came On The Sloop John B
My Grandfather And Me.
'Round Nassau Town We Did Roam
Drinking All Night Had Many Fight.
I Feel So Broke Up
I Wanna Go Home

The First Mate He Got So Drunk
He Broke Open My Trunk.
Poor Sea-Sick Me On The Foam.
Oceans Are Grand,
But Give Me The Land.
I Feel So Broke Up
I Wanna Go Home

The Cook Went And Got The Fits
He Poured Beer On My Grits.
Into My Soup Went His Comb.
Oh, What A Trip!
This Mis'rable Ship
I Feel So Broke Up
I Wanna Go Home

(Chorus)
So Hoist Up The John B. Sails,
And Clean Up The John B. Rails
Oh, Captain, please, Come Aboard
And Sail Me Back Home
The Sloop, The John B.
Can Travel The Sea.
Next Time without Me, I Wanna Go Home.
