Uno dos tres do it

She smokes ha ha
She smokes ha ha
Say what
Ha ha ha she smokes ha ha
Smoking what baby
Ha ha she smokes
Ha ha she smokes

She came from Hilversum just as a lady
She started to dance
And then the men went crazy
She danced and danced all through the night
With a body baby
That was made out of sight
From the spotlight her face was a ghost
She was mean and nasty
'Cause she knew her doo
The music stopped
And they turned off the lights
And that's when the crowd started to fight

Chorus:
She was Sadie
Sadie, Sadie such a lady hee Sady
She was Sadie
Sadie, Sadie such a lady hee Sady
She danced to the beat
When she moved her feet
She rocks to the rhythm
'Cause she's dressed so neat
She was Sadie
Sadie, Sadie such a lady hee Sadie
She was Sadie
Sadie, Sadie such a lady hee Sadie

One two three four, get out on the floor
If you want some more, do it

Sadie was no lady

She smokes to the beat, ha ha she smokes everybody
She smokes to the beat, ha ha she smokes everybody
She smokes to the beat, ha ha she smokes everybody
She smokes to the beat, ha ha she smokes everybody

She danced and boegied and boogied
All down to a funky rhapsody
And from the moonlight
Her hair was as bright as gold
She was a treasure for the world to see
She had moves like
It makes men lose their mind
She lets them in a penitentiary
She had hips like a move a mountain top
And her body was ment fifi

Chorus: ...

Sadie was no lady, there we go
Everybody out there in Holland and Belgium
All over the world
Come on friends let's boogie down there
Here we go, do it

Whoo Sadie groove Sadie, sexy lady

Rock everybody, everybody shake your thing
Just shake everybody, everybody rock and sing
Rock everybody, everybody shake your thing
Just shake everybody, everybody rock and sing
Do it

She smokes beep beep she smokes two two (5x)

Do it baby here we go
To the beat everybody, to the beat (3x)

She smokes beep beep she smokes two two (2x)

Sadie, Sadie my sexy lady
Just to hear my heart is going crazy
Just to rock my soul and take it told
Jus to work your body you're not too old

Sadie, Sadie my only girl
You're the one my only pearl
I love you in the morning
And I love you in the night
I love you in the evening
'Cause love is all right
Come on baby just rock me one time
Let me feel that your love
That your love ain't blind
Sadie, Sadie my sexy lady
Just to hear my heart is going crazy
Sadie
Oh but that's the way
That the world keeps on turning
round and round we go
As far as I'm concerned
Well it may not be heaven
But it's better than what's down below
So let's all join hands and head for that rainbow
Keep working till our dreams come true
And we'll meet together in the promised land
And start the world anew

Chorus: ...9x...
