Now I know the truth about you
the lie you lives deceiving me
all the dreams you will destroy
and leave me lost and vulnerabel.

Hush now baby don't you cry
mother loves you only pressure heavy on her mind.
Every day brings one more debt
nothing left to pay only tears and sweat.
Life goes down, down, down, down,
life goes down.
Life goes down, down, down, down,
life goes down.

Why do you abuse your friend ?
It's not her fault 
that you can't find a means to an end.
Can't you see it's working well,
The way they turn you against yourself ?

Life goes down, down, down, down,
life goes down.
