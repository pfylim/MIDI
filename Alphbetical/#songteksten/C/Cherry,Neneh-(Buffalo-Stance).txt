NENEH CHERRY - BUFFALO STANCE

(Gigolo) ha ha how melodic
(Ooh) ooh yeah DJ

Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets
In his crocodile feet
Hanging off the kerf
Lookin' all disturbed
As the boys from home
They all came running
They were makin' noise
Manhandlin' toys
That's the girls on the block
With the nasty curls
Wearin' padded bras
Wearin' padded bras
Sucking beer through straws
Dropping down their draws
But did you get yours

(Gigolo) huh sucker (gigolo)
(Gigolo) huh sucker (gigolo)

Who's looking good today
Who's lookin' good in every way
No style for key
You better watch don't mess with me

Refrain:
No money man could win my love
It's the sweetness that I'm thinkin' of
We always hang in a buffalo stance
We do the dive every time we dance
I give you love baby not romance
I make the move nothing left to chance
So don't you get fresh with me

(Wah wah) get funky
(Wah) yeah Timmy (one two)
So you say you wanted money
But you know it's never funny
When your shoe's worn through
And there's a rumble in your tummy
But you have to have style
Get a gold tooth smile
Put a girl on the corner
So you can make a pound
Committed a crime
And went inside 
He was coming your way
But you had to survive
When you lost your pain
You lost the race
Now you're lookin' at me
To take her place
Who's lookin' good today
Who's lookin' good in every way
No style for key
You better watch don't mess with me

Refrain: ...

Smokin' not cokin'
Get funky sax

Lookin' good hangin' with the wild bunch
Lookin' good in a buffalo stance
Lookin' good when it comes to the crunch
Lookin' good's a state of mind
State of mind don't look behind you
State of mind or you'll be dead
State of mind may I remind you
Bomb the bass rock this place

What is he like
What's he like anyway
(Hoo hoo hoo)
Oh man what do you expect
The guy's a gigolo man
Ha ha ha ha aah ha
You  know what I mean (ooh)

Refrain: ...

The wind on my face
Sound in my ears
Water from my eyes
And you on my mind
As I sink diving down deep
Deeper into your soul

No money man could win my love
It's the sweetness that I'm thinking of
No money man could win my love
It's the sweetness that I'm thinking of
No money man could win my love
