NENEH CHERRY - KISSES ON THE WIND

(Words & music: N. Cherry/M. Vey)

Pero chika mi amiga, que dices
(Esto es yo esto es yo y como hablo y hablo a si
Y hablo a si con tigo)
(Doo-d-doo doo doo doo eh)
(Nah man what whe're gonna do right here is go back) yeah
(I tell em man tu eres mi amiga tu sabes)
(Esto es ya como amiga I take me back)
I don't sing in Swahili (yeah)
(Yeah, que dices chica, tu ayes, me vay)

Down this wild street walks
Walks a child with no trace
Of ever being as young as her sister
A local neighbourhood crush
The boys would hide out and watch
Her hanging washing on the line all the time

More like a woman she talks like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl to turn the boys on

Refrain:
Boys, boys wrapped around her finger
So young making love was only dreaming
The girl she's got another story
When they are gone
She blows them kisses on the wind

(Esta una bombe de la moment bosta)

At the corner shop halfway down the block
All the radios pumping to the way she walks
Past the flyboy's art where her name's engraved
Sweet liberty is what it says

More like a woman
She dressed like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl
To turn the boys on

Refrain: ...

(Bosta una bomba)
Yes(pero me n'importa que te digo hombre mi amigo nah)
How 'bout another kiss baby
(It doesn't matter y'know what I'm saying oh no forget it)
('Cause I'm going down man y'know)
(You could follow me but y'know what I'm saying)
(Don't make me say it I no say OK me voy)

The price of puberty's got
A way of showing (showing)
(What we're gonna do here is go back)
It doesn't come in easy stages (way back back into time)
Her mother's face in the pot (back back back)
She won't ever leave it (back back into time)
She needs a bell to ring the changes

More like a woman she walked like one
She was the first girl
She was the first girl to turn the boys on

Refrain: ...2x...

(Nah man I gotta go dancing)
(I told you yeah about that Latin quarter)
(Man you asked me that already)
(Sorry no pero I said okay ah)
(I no say amiga me little sister)
(Y'know what I'm saying)
(Y'know esta es en la piel y todo la digo)
(Y yo yo say okay)
(Take a rock y'know what I'm saying no pero)
