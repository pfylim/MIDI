Title  : I WANT YOU TO WANT ME

(Words & music: Rick Nielsen)

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say
That you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me

I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me

I'll shine up my old brown shoes
I'll put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say
That you love me

Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you crying
