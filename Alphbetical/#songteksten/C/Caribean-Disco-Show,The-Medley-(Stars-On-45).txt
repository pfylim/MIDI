  This is my island in the sun
  Where my people have toiled 
  Since time begun 
  I may sail on many a sea
  But her shores will always be home to me.

  All my days I will sing in praise
  Of your forest, waters
  Your shining sands.

  Down the way  
  Where the nights are gay
  And the sun  shines daily 
  On the mountain top
  I took a trip on a sailing ship
  And when I reached Jamaica
  I made a stop
  But I'm sad to say I'm on my way
  Won't be back for many a day
  My heart is down
  My head is turning around
  I have to leave a little girl 
  In Kingston Town.
