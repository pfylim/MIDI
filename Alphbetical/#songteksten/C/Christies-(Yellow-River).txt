     
      Yellow River            Christies


So long boy,you can take my place,
got my papers,I've got my pay,
so pack my bags and I'll be on my way,
to Yellow River.
Put my gun down,the war is won,
fill my glass high,the time has come,
I'm going backto the place that I love,
Yellow River.

Yellow River, Yellow River,
is in my mind and in my eyes.
Yellow River, Yellow River
is in my blood,it's the place I love.
Got no time for explanations,
got no time to lose,
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping
underneath the moon at Yellow River.

Cannon firelingers in my mind,
I'm so glad that I'm still alive,
and I've been gone for such a long time,
from Yellow River.
I remember the nights were cool,
I can still see the water pool,
And I remember the girl that I knew,
from Yellow River.

Yellow River, Yellow River,
in in my mind...
