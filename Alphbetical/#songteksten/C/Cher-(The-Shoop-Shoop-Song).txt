Does he love me I want to know
How can I tell if he loves me so
Is it in his eyes? No
You'll be deceived
Is it in his sighs? No
He'll make believe
I want to know if he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
Is it in his face? No
That's just his charms
In his warm embrace? No
That's just his arms
If you want to know
If he loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
--------------------------------------------------------
Kiss him and squeeze him tight
And find out what you want to know
Promise love, if it really is
It's there in his kiss
About the way he acts, No!
That's not the way
And you're not listenin'
To all I say
If you want know
Shoopy loves you so
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
It's in his kiss
That's where it is
