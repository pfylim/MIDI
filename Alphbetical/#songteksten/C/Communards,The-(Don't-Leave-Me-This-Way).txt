COMMUNARDS - DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY


Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Refrain:
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started the fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
So come on down and satisfy the need in me
Cos only your good loving can set me free

Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please don't leave me this way

Don't leave me this way
Cos I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way

Refrain: ...

Don't leave me this way
Cos I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way
