CULTURE CLUB - THE WAR SONG

War war is stupid
And people are stupid
And love means nothing
In some strange quarters
War war is stupid
And people are stupid
And I hear the banging
Of hearts and fingers, war

People fill the world
With narrow confidence
Like a child at birth
A man with no defence
What's mine's my own
I won't give it to you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

Refrain:
Man is far behind
In the search for something new
Like a Philistine
We're burning witches too
This world of fate
Must be designed for you
It matters what you say
It matters what you do
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

Refrain: ...

After the bird has flown
He walked ten thousand miles
Back home
You can't do that to me no
You can't do that to me
You can't do that to me no
You can't do that to me

War war

In this heart of mine
I find a place for you
For black or white
For grown-up children too
Now we're fighting in our hearts
Fighting in the streets
Won't somebody help me

Refrain: ...

No more war
(War war is stupid)
Say no more war
(And people are stupid)
Say ooh
(And love means nothing)
(In some strange quarters)
Say ooh
(And love means nothing)
(In some strange quarters)
Senso Hant Ai
(The war is stupid)
Say no more war
(And I hear the banging)
Say no more war
(Of hearts and fingers)
