12. Take It To The Limit - Centory & Turbo B.

You know we got to do
We got to take it to the limit

I look up into the sky
And I see the stars are shining all so brightly
And I can't get you off of my mind
A beam of light will shine upon you
and show you now that I can be true
And I can't get you off of my mind
We got to take it to the limit.

Take it to the limit
Take it to the top
If you understand
It's never gonna stop
Take it to the limit
Take it to the top
If you're gonna get there
We're gonna take it to the limit.

Take it to the limit baby
Just like I don't make you
You drive me crazy
The way you make me feel
Real do wholly feel like a magnetospiel
Turn around turn around
My heart is burning
Troubles are coming
Can't see much around them

Every dude has a right to be wrong
