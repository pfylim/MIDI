Singer : CHAMPAGNE 
Title  : ROCK AND ROLL STAR

(Words & music: Wally Tax/Martin Duiser)

Now he's free
Not like you and me
They treat him like a star you see
Now he's got the key
He's fancy free
He doesn't hide from ecstasy
Do you hear me
Do you hear me

Refrain:
He's with the angels and the sun in the sky
He's a rock and roll star
He's got it made, plays it straighter than straight
He's a rock and roll star
A super star he feels fine
He's a rock and roll star
A super star he feels fine

Would you believe
O he lived without grieve
They let him go on new years eve
Fortune and fame
Oh what a shame
There ain't nobody left to blame
Do you hear me
Do you hear me

Refrain: ...
