 Titel:  Leave a light on for me
 Artist: Belinda Carlisle

 Take my hand - tell me what you are feeling
 Understand - this is just the beginning
 Although I have to go
 It makes me feel like crying
 I don't know when I'll see you again...

 [Chorus]

 Honey leave a light on for me
 I'll be there before you close the door
 To give you all the love that you need
 Darling leave a light on for me
 Cos when the world takes me away
 You are still the air that I breathe

 I can't explain, I don't know
 Just how far I have to go...
 But darling I'll keep the peace
 Just leave a light on for me

 [Verse 2]
 Yes I know what I'm asking is crazy
 You could go, just get tired of waiting
 But if I lose your love
 Put off by my desire
 That would be the one regret of my life

 [Chorus]

 Just like a spark lights up the dark
 Baby that's your heart
 Baby that's your heart
 Baby that's your heart

 [Sax solo] - bend that whammy bar !

 [repeat Chorus to fade, assorted whines and overdubs]
