Callin', callin' Doctor Love
Callin', callin' Doctor Love
Mamma shouldn't 'a called you
To come and treat me good
For the reason for my fever
She never understood
But I've always had a weakness
For a man in a uniform
And when you took my heart beats
Boy you turned me on

Callin', callin' Doctor Love
Callin', callin' Doctor Love
Temperature is rising
So you bring 'round a bottle of pills
But doctor can't you see
It's my heart that's really ill
So put away your medicine
And you special therapy
'Cause the reason for my fever
Is very fond of me

You said that I was better
And nothing was the matter with me
Doctor Love, please come running
Can't you see I'm in pain
You've broken my heart
And you should be ashamed
Doctor Love please come running
Can't you see I'm in pain
My pulse is getting weaker
Please come back to me
