Boy you and I should hide away
as far as love will let us stray
we will dance for ever and a day
be together for eternity.

We shall bloom in our spring affair
steal a kiss beneath the golden moon
run hand in hand without a care
and flourish in the summer sun.

I love you.

Autumn's breeze blows gently
through your hair
to you I give my heart completely
and as winter days grow dark and cold
I'll keep warm in the glow of your love.

I love you, yes I do
I love you, yes I do
I love you,
I love you.
