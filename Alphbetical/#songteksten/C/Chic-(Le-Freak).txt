One, two, ooh
Freak out
Le freak, c'est chic, freak out

Have you heard about new bands great
Listen to us, I'm sure you be amazed
Big fun to be by everyone
It's up to you
I'm sure it can't be done

Young and old
I do it when I'm told
Just one try
And you too will be so
It's called le freak
They're doing it all the same
And now we're showing it all ooh
Freak on

Le freak, c'est chic, freak on

All that mission
Got you down
Guys ahead
I'm spending all around
Feel the rhythm
It can't ...
Come warming up
And have a real good time
Stop the dance ooh
Stopping as a boy
Now we're in oh what a joy
Just come on down to the dancing floor
Fine someone right on the floor
Ooh freak on

Le freak, c'est chic, freak on

All that magic strikes you down
Spending all around
Feel the rhythm
Get the rhyme
Come all along
And have a real good time

Stopping like a boy
Now let's freak
Oh what a joy
Just come on down
To the disco bar
Find you one
Right on the floor

Oh, freak on
Le freak, c'est chic, freak on
Oh, freak on
Le freak, c'est chic, freak on
