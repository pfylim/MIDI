Title  : DANCE, DANCE, DANCE

(Words & music: Kenny Lehman/Bernard Edwards/Nile Rodgers)

Dance, dance, dance, dance
Keep on dancing
Dance, dance, dance, dance

This dancin' to the beat, feel the heat
I'm movin' my feet
Headin' towards the floor, gonna get down
A, get down some more

Rumba, tango
Latin hustle too
Yow-sah, yow-sah, yow-sah
I wanna boogie with you

Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Oh, what a treat, feel so sweet
That body heat
When I'm dancin' with my baby
Drives me crazy
Makes me hazy

Rumba, tango
Latin hustle too
Yow-sah, yow-sah, yow-sah
I wanna boogie with you

Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Ba, ba, ba, ba, baw
Dance, dance, dance, dance
