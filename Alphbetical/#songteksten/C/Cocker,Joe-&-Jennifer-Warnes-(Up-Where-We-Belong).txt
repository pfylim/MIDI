13. UP WHERE WE BELONG - JOE COCKER & JENNIFER WARNES

Vorspiel (4 Takte nur Piano):    

Vers 1:
Sie: Who  knows what tomorrow brings 
      In a world  few hearts survive 
Er:  All I know  is the way I feel; 
      when it's real, I keep it alive 
      The road  is long  There are mountains in our way, 
      but we climb  a step  ev'ry day 

Refrain (im Duett):
Beide: Love lift us up where we belong, 
          where the eagles cry  on a mountain high 
          Love lift us up where we belong, 
          far from the world we know, 
Er:    Up where the clear winds blow 

Bridge (2 Takte Piano)  
Vers 2:
Er:  Some  hang on to "use-to-be", 
      live their lives  looking behind 
Sie: All we have  is here and now; 
     all our life,  out there to find 
Er:  The road  is long  There are mountains  in our way, 
       but we climb them a step  ev'ry day 

Refrain (im Duett):
Beide: Love lift us up where we belong, 
       where the eagles cry  on a mountain high 
       Love lift us up where we belong, 
       far from the world we know,
Er:    Up where the clear winds blow 

Zwischenvers:
Er: Time goes by,  no time to cry 
    Life's you and I,  alive,  today 

Refrain (im Duett):
Beide: Love lift us up where we belong, 
       where the eagles cry  on a mountain high 
       Love lift us up where we belong, 
       far from the world we know,
Er:    Up where the clear winds blow 

Repeat refrain and fade out
