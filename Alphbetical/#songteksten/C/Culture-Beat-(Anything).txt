  ANYTHING (CULTURE BEAT)
  
  Is there anything more I can do for you
  Should my hair be red or shall it be blue
  Is there anything more I can do for you
  Shall I let the green grass turn black for you
  If there's something more you want me to do
  Shall I hide no more my secrets to you
  Maybe then you'll see me through
  if there's something more
  Yeah yeah yehi
