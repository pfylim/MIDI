Title  : GET DOWN

(Words & music: J. Thompson)

Fine, fine foxy lady
Get down, get down
We are gonna stay, do the boogie
Baby get on down, get on down
I know a funky place that we can dance all night
You can be my lady if you play your cards right
But you got to get down
Get on down, get on down, baby
Get on down, get on down, sugar, get on down

Yeah you're looking real good
And you're hard to talk, yeah
Baby get on down, get on down
You, don't you ever stop, no, no
Baby get on down, get on down

Girl you're moving everywhere
You show and let people stop and stare
Get down, get on down etc.

Get on down (7x)

Cool that, you are real baby
Baby get on down, get on down
Shift it in third, queer mama
Honey, get on down, get on down

Ain't nothing too good for you
I love that you can do it too
Aah, get on down, get on down etc.
