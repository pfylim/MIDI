            DOWNTOWN                            
                            As performed by: Petula Clark                                 

     When you're alone and life is keeping you lonely, 
     you can always go.."Downtown".
     When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry,
     seems to help, I know,..."Downtown".

     Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city.
     Linger on the sidewalk, where the neon-signs are pretty.
     How can you lose?...

     The lights are much brighter there.
     You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares.

     So go "Downtown", things'll be great when you're "Downtown"
     No finer place for sure "Downtown"
     Ev'rything's waiting for you-ou--- "Downtown",..."Downtown"...

     Don't hang around an' let your problems surround you,
     there are movie-shows.."Downtown"..
     Maybe you know some little places to got to
     where they never close.."Downtown".

     Just listen to the rhythm of the gentle Bossanova.
     You'll be dancing with 'em too, 
     before the night is over,.ha-ppy again.

     The lights are much brighter there.
     You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares.

     So go "Downtown"..where all the lights are bright.."Downtown"
     Waiting for you tonight.."Downtown".
     You're gonna be alri-ight now-ow---..
     "Downtown",..."Downtown",..."Downtown",..."Downtown"...

     MUSIC BREAK........................"Downtown"
     ..................................."Downtown"

     And you may find somebody, kind, 
     to help and understand you.
     Someone who is just like you 
     and needs a gentle hand to guide them along..

     So maybe I'll see you there.
     We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares.

     So go "Downtown"..things'll be great when you're.."Downtown"
     Don't wait a minute..more.."Downtown"
     ev'rything's waiting for you-ou---
     "Downtown"..."Downtown"..."Downtown"..."Downtown"...
     go "Downtown"... oh yeah "Downtown"..."Downtown"..."Downtown"...
     "Downtown"..."Downtown"..."Downtown"..."Downtown"...
