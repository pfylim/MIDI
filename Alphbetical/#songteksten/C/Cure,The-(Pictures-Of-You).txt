I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures
are all that I feel
--------------------------------------------------------
Remembering you standing quiet
in the rain as I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky
fell in holding you close how
I always held you close in your fear
--------------------------------------------------------
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamend all the make-believe screams
at the sky. And you finally found all your
courage to let it all go
--------------------------------------------------------
Remembering you allen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white so delicate
lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you how you used to be
slow drowned
You were angels so much more than everything
Oh hold for the last time than slip away quietly
Open my eyes but I never see anything
--------------------------------------------------------
If only I'd thought for the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought for the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
--------------------------------------------------------
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
--------------------------------------------------------
There was nothing in the world
that I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
that I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you
