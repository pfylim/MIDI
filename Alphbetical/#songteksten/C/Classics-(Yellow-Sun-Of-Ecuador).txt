Singer : CLASSICS 
Title  : YELLOW SUN OF ECUADOR 
 
Yellow sun, yellow sun of Ecuador 
Lead me on, to the girl that I adore 
Yellow sun, yellow sun of Ecuador 
If you do then I will never ask for more 
 
Take me to the land of Rio Bamba 
There is where I left my Anna 
In the hills of Alausi 
There is where she waits for me 
 
Yellow sun, yellow sun of Ecuador 
If you do then I will never ask for more
