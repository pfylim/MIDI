Title  : I LOVE TO LOVE (BUT MY BABY JUST LOVES TO DANCE)

Ooh, I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
He wants to dance
He loves to dance
He's got to dance

Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance
No no no, oh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

The minute the band begins to swing it
He's on his feet to dig it 
And dance the night away
Stop, I'm spinning like a top
We'll dance until we drop
But if I have my way, oh

But he won't give our love a chance
No no no, oh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance

Sometimes instead of going downtown
We'll stay at home and get down
To what I'm trying to say

Oh, I love to love
But there's no time for our romance
No no no, oh I love to love
But my baby just loves to dance
