Title  : KINGS OF CLUBS

(Words & music: Jack Donder/Jean Luc Drion)

Move, move baby
Come, come baby
I need you baby

Robin fly, daddy cool, getting up
Moving on, get away, that's a give
Nice and slow, robin fly
Daddy cool, no no no

Oh we wait so long

Robin fly, daddy cool, getting up
Moving on, get away, that's a give
Nice and slow, robin fly
Daddy cool, no no no
Oh me, come on, take me

We're the king of clubs
We're the king of clubs
