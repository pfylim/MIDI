12. CRYING IN THE RAIN - CULTURE BEAT

Yeah oh no no
Uuh Uuh
Oh, crying in the rain.
Stop that crying, stop that lying.
It`s boring me.
I don`t wanna spend my time with you.
Stop to think that 
Once you brought me to ecstasy.
You win my loving but I really mean
Ooh

Stop that crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.
Oh, oh oh
Crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.
Oh

Rap 1

Stop your grief, you lie
You've got your laws
And I can hear your freezing till you drop
desperate, drowning, dirty things
Juvenile jazz you hide,
Can't loose no often date with shit
Fate removin' in your eyes
weary from how you earned your wings
You stood for sliding, slowly, slippin'
Shinky simple, forcing also in pursuit of passion
Can't touch my grip of faith
Break, betrayin' this aray of fever
Suffer, fryin' in the pain
Deceitful food that couldn't care
less if you're cryin' in the rain 

Stop that crying, stop that lying.
It`s boring me.
I don`t wanna spend my time with you.
Stop to think that 
Once you brought me to ecstasy.
You win my loving but I really mean
Ooh

Stop that crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.
Oh, oh oh
Crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.

Crying in the rain
Ooh oh

Rap 2

Frequent proof you will 
Trapped in your talks
Can't shake hate when friction's all you feel
make up too high, make up of something
Just not the head of skills, manial madness
Motion'll make you faar too crazy from pride
we want to work wonders for wealth
you dig the third trophey for darkness
dance, you deal with the devil
trippin' for treasures, plastic pleasures
Headlines and inside jokes
and thanks for gawkes that you have
When the serpent seemed to save the show
You can't afford to faint alone
You're cryin' in the rain

No more crying in the rain.
No more driving me insane.
No more crying. Uuh

Stop that crying, stop that lying.
It`s boring me.
I don`t wanna spend my time with you.
Stop to think that 
Once you brought me to ecstasy.
You win my loving but I really mean.
Ooh

Stop that crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.
Oh, oh oh
Crying in the rain now.
No more crying in the rain.
Who said that crying in the rain
Could ever wash away a love affair.

Ooh.
