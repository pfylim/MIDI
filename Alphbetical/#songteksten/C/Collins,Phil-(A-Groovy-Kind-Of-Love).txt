PHIL COLLINS - A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE

(Words & music: Toni Wine/Carol Bayer)

When I'm feeling blue
All I have to do
Is take a look at you
Then I'm not so blue

When you're close to me
I can feel you heartbeat
I can hear you breathing
In my ear

Refrain:
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love
When I'm in your arms
Nothing seems to matter
I the world would shatter
I don't care
Wouldn't you agree
Baby, you and me
Got a groovy kind of love
We got a groovy kind of love

Anytime you want to 
You can turn me on to
Anytime at all
When I taste your lips
Oh I start to shiver
Can't control the quivering inside
