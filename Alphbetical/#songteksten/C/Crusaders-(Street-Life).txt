Singer : CRUSADERS featuring Randy Crawford
Title  : STREET LIFE

(Words & music: Joe Sample/W. Jennings)

I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life, it's the only life I know
Street life, and there's a thousand parts to play
Street life, until you play your life away

You let the people see
Just who you want to be
And ev'ry night you shine
Just like a superstar
That's how the life is played
A ten cent masquerade
You dress and walk and talk
You're who you think you are

Street life, you can run away from time
Street life, for a nickle and a dime
Street life, but you better not get old
Street life, or you're gonna feel the cold
There's always love for sale
A grown up fairy tale
Prince Charming always smiles behind a silver spoon
And if you keep it young
Your song is always sung
You love will play your way
Beneath the silver moon

Street life, street life
Oh street life
