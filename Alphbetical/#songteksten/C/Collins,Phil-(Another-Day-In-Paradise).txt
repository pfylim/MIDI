PHIL COLLINS - ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE

(Words & music: Phil Collins)

She calls me out to the man on the street
Sir can you help me
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me

He walks on doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day 
For you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Think about it

She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day 
For you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it

Oh Lord is there nothing more
Anybody can do
Oh oh oh Lord there must be 
Something you can say

You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
'Cause she didn't fit in there

Oh think twice
'Cause it's another day
For you and me in paradise
Oh think twice
It's just another day
For you, you and me in paradise
Just think about it mmm, mmm
Think about it

It's just another day for you and me in paradise
It's just another day for you and me in paradise
(Para-paradise)
Paradise (it's another day for you and me)
Ooh, ooh just think about it (in paradise)
Paradise (its' another day for you and me)
Just think about it (in paradise para-paradise)
Ooh in paradise (it's another day for you and me)
Mmm, mmm paradise (in paradise)
Paradise (it's another day for you and me)
Just another day
