       You can't hurry love          Phil Collins 


I need love , love oh to ease my mind ,
And I need to find time someone to call mine .

Refrain

My mama said : You can't hurry love ,
No you just have to wait , she said ,
Love don't come easy , it's a game of
Give and take.
You can't hurry love,
No you just have to wait.
Just try on my good times 
No matter how long it takes.

How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again ?
You're not the only thing , that keeps me hanging on,
When I feel my strength ooh is almost gone.

I remember Mama said :

Refrain

You can't hurry love ...

How long must I wait , how much more must I take
Before loneliness will cause my heart , heart to break?

Now I can't bear to live my life alone.
I've grown impatient for a love to call my own.
When I feel that I , I can't go on,
Well,these precious words keep me hanging on.

I remember Mama said :

Refrain

You can't hurry love ...

Now I wait . Now love - love , you don't come easyk.
But I keep on waiting and anticipating
For that some voice talk to me at night ,
For some tender arms hold me tight.
I keep waiting till that day
But it ain't easy , you know ,
It ain't easy when my Mama said :

Refrain

You can't hurry love ...
