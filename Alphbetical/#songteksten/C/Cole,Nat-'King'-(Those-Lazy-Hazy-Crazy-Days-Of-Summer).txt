Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer.

Just fill your basket full of sandwiches and weenies,
then lock the house up, now you're set.
And on the beach you'll see the girls in their bikinis.
As cute as ever but they never get them wet.

Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
You'll wish that summer could always be here.

Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer.

Don't have to tell a girl and feller 'bout a drive in,
or some romantic movie scene.
Why, from the moment that those lovers start arrivin',
you'll see more kissing in the cars than on the screen.

Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
You'll wish that summer could always be here.

Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
Dust off the sun and moon and sing a song of cheer.

And there's the good old fashioned picnic, and they still go,
always will go any time. 
And there will always be a moment that can thrill so,
as when the old quartette sings out, "Sweet A - der - line"

Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer,
those days of soda and pretzels and beer.
Roll out those lazy hazy crazy days of summer;
You'll wish that summer could always be here.
