Singer : THE COMMODORES 
Title  : THREE TIMES A LADY

(Words & music: Lionel Richie)

Thanks for the times that you've given me
The mem'ries are all in my mind
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud

Chorus:
You're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you
Yes, you're once, twice, three times a lady
And I love you, I love you

You've shared my dreams, my joys, my pains
You've made my life worth living for
And if I had to live my life over again dear
I'd spend each and ev'ry moment with you

Chorus: ...

When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you
There's nothing to keep us apart

Chorus: ...
