
1. '74-'75 - The Connells

Got no reason for coming to me
And the rain running down
There's no reason.

And the same voice coming to me
Like it's all slowing down
And believe me.

I was the one that you know
I wish you sorry ever after '74-75.

It's not easy
Nothing to say 'cause it's already said
It's never easy.

When I look on your eyes
Then I find that I'll do fine
When I look up in your eyes
Then I'll be better.

CHORUS:
I was the one that you know
I was your sorry ever after '74-75.
Give me more and I'll do fine
'Cause you're really only after '74-75.

Got no reason for coming to me
And the rain running down
There's no reason.

When I look on your eyes
And I find that I'll do fine
When I look on your eyes
And I'll do better.

CHORUS
(REPEAT)
