We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson, goin' to mess around
I'm goin' to Jackson, you know I'm pleasure bound

Well you go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand like a lover man, and make a big fool of yourself
Go on to Jackson, but you comb that hair
I'm gonna snowball Jackson, go ahead and see if I care

Solo

When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna beg me, teach'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, turn loose my code
I'm goin' to Jackson, goodbye that's all she wrote

When they laugh at you in Jackson, I`ll be dancing in the pony keg
Then I'll lead you round like a scoulded hound, 
with your tail tucked between your legs so go on to Jackson, you big talking man
I'll be waiting there in Jackson, behind my Japan fan
