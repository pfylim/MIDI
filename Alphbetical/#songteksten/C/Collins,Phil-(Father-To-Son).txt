Somwhere down the road, you're gonna find a place
it seems so far, but it never is
you won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength
on the way

Sometimes you may feel you're the only one
cos all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone
but you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along
watching you til all your work is done

When you find your heart, you'd better run with it
cos when she cames along, she could be breaking it
now there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong
don't look back
she may soon be gone, so don't look back
she's not the only one, remember that

If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right
if you don't know what to say, well, that's alright
you don't know what to do ?
Remember she's just as scared as you

Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say
remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway
then you must lift your head, keep it there
remember what I said
I'll always be with you don't forget
just look over your shoulder I'll be there
