Title  : THE WAY YOU DO THE THINGS YOU DO

(Words & music: William Robinson/Bobby Rodgers)

You got a smile so bright
You know you could've been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could've been a handle

The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could've been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could've been some perfume

Chorus:
Well you could've been anything
That you wanted to and I can tell
The way you do the things you do
Ah baby

As pretty as you are
You know you could've been a flower
If good looks caused a minute
You know that could be an hour

The way you stole my heart
You know you could've been a cool cook
And baby you're so smart
You know you could've been a school book

Chorus: ...
