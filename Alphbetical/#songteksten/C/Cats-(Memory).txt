  8. Memory - Cats
  
  Midnight not a sound from the pavement
  Has the moon lost her memory
  She is smiling alone
  In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet
  And the wind begins to moan
  
  Memory all alone in the moonlight
  I can dream of the old days
  Life was beautiful then
  I remember the time I knew what happiness was
  Let the memory live again
  
  Every street lamp seems to need a fatalistic morning
  Someone mutters and the street lamp gathers
  And soon it will be morning
  Daylight I must wait for the sunrise
  I must think of the new life
  And I mustn't give in
  When the dawn comes
  Tonight will be a memory too
  And a new day will begin
  
  Round our dens of smoky days
  The stale cold smell of morning
  The street lamp dies
  Another night is over
  Another day is dawning
  
  Touch me
  It's so easy to leave me
  All alone with the memory
  Of my days in the sun
  If you touch me
  You will understand what happiness is
  Look a new day has begun.
