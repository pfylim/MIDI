CAMEO - WORD UP

(Words & music: L. Blackmon/T.Jenkins)

Oh oh
Yo pretty ladies around the world
Got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother and your sister
And your mama too
'Cause they're about to go down
And you'll know just what to do

Wave your hand in the air
Like you don't care
Glide by the people
As they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance
Do your dance quick mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Ah word up oh oh 
Everybody say
When you hear the call
You've got to get it under way
Word up oh oh
It's the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker DJ's
Who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs
And act real cool
But you got to realize
That you're acting like fools

If there's music we can use it
We need to dance
We don't have the time
For psychological romance
No romance no romance
No romance for me mama
Come on baby tell me what's the word

Ah word up oh oh 
Everybody say
When you hear the call
You've got to get it under way

Oh
Go L for low
Ah hey hey ooh
Just come on all you people say

w.o.r.d. up

Hey hey hey
Ooh say like that like that
Say you like that
Come on baby what's the word
What's the word everybody's got
To know know
I say an ha ow take me real low
