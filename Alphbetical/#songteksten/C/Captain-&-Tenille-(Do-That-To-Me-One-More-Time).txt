Title  : DO THAT TO ME ONE MORE TIME

(Words & music: Toni Tenille)

Do that to me one more time
Once is never enough with a man like you
Oh, do that to me one more time
I can never get enough of a man like you
Oh, kiss me like you just did
Oh baby, do that to me once again

Pass that by me one more time
Once is never enough for my heart to hear
Oh, tell it to me one more time
I can never hear enough while I've got you near
Oh, say those words again like you just did
Oh baby, tell it to me once again

(repeat)
