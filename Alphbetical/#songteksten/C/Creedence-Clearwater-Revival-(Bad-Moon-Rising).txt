   Bad Moon Rising     C.C.R. 


I see the bad moon arising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightnin'
I see bad times today

Refrain

Don't go around tonight
It's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise


I hear hurricans ablowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear rivers overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and rain

Refrain

Don't go around tonight ...

       
Hope you got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
