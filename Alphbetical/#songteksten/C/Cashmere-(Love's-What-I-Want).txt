Title  : LOVE'S WHAT I WANT

(Words & music: Sayer/Hammond/Hollestelle)

Chorus 1:
Love's what I want
Let's be good to one another
Love's what I want
Let's just give it to each other

Well I'll do what I can
To show you I'm a man
And I'll teach you right and wrong
To get the feeling strong
And I see you down the floor
And I'll give you more and more
But I'll give you one more try
To see I don't tell you no lie

Chorus 2:
Love's what I want
Let's just give it to each other
Love's what I want
Don't you give it to another

Oh, I won't treat you mean
I show you lights you've never seen
Don't you ever never care
About love that we would share

Don't you give it to another
Don't you give it to another
And don't ever let me down
And don't ever let me down

Chorus 1: ...

I won't give it to another
I won't give it to another
I won't give it to another
I won't give it to another
I won't give it to another

I'll never forget
The things I have said
Say you never go away
Say you'll always gonna stay

Love's what I want
Let's be good to one another
Love's what I want
Let's just give it to each other
Love's what I want
Don't you give it to another
I won't give it to another
