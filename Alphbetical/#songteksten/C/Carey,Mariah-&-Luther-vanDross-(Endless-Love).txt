1. ENDLESS LOVE - LUTHER VANDROSS & MARIAH CAREY

My love, there's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love, you're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I
I want to share all my love with you
No one else will do
And your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh yes, you will always be my endless love

Two hearts, two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
'Cause baby you, you mean the world to me
Oh I know I found in you my endless love

Oh love, I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
That you know I don't mind
And yes, you'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love, my endless love
