Title  : REMEMBER SEPTEMBER

Graduation day in the end of July
We were all of us drinking or getting high
When Johnny said hey, are you doing o.k.
Remember

The whole sunshiny summer along
We had night beach-parties singing rock and roll songs
I'm wondering why, it all has to die in September

Remember September, I do
Remember September, do you
That late summer night when we started a fight
I don't know anymore who was wrong or right
Remember September, I do
Remember September, do you

The good times we had have somehow gone bad
Thinking of summer are you happy or sad

You were wearing your brother's baseball shirt
The night of the fight were he got hurt
The number was eight, yes it wasn't too late
Remember

Something more or something less
Forget the details remember the best
We'll get together again yes we can in September

Remember September, I do
Remember September, do you
That late summer night when we started a fight
I don't know anymore who was wrong or right
Remember September, I do
Remember September, do you
