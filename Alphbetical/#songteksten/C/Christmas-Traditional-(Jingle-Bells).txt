  4. JINGLE BELLS - TRADITIONAL
  
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingles all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingles all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
  
  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
  Over the fields we go laughing all the way
  Bells on bobtails ring making spirits bright
  Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighin' song tonight
  
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
  
  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh
  Over the fields we go laughing all the way
  Bells on bobtails ring making spirits bright
  Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleighin' song tonight
  
  Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingles all the way
  Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
