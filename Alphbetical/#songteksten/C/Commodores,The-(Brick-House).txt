(Words & music: Commodores)

Chorus:
Oh, she's a brick house
She's mighty, mighty
Just lettin' it all hang out
Ah she's a brick house
Ah that lady stacked and that's a facet
Ain't holdin' nothin' back
Oh she's a brick house
Well we're together, everybody knows
This is how the story goes

She knows she's got everything
That a woman needs, to get a man yeah
How could she lose with the stuff she use
Thirty six, twenty four thirty six
Of what a winning hand

Chorus: ...

She's the one, the only one
Built like an amazone
The clothes she wears, her sexy ways
Make an old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sho'nuff can knock a strong man to his knees

Chorus: ...

Ain't holdin' nothin' back
Oh shook a dow shook a dow dow
Shook a dow shook a dow dow

Chorus: ...
