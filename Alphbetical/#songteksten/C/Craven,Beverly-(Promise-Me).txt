                       PROMISE ME

    VSP


    You light up another cigarette and I, thought it awhile

    It's four o'clock in the morning and it's starting to get light

    Now I might where I wanna be, losing track of time

    But I wish that it was still last night


    You look like you live in another world

    and I, could read your mind

    How can you be so far away, lying by my side

    
    When I go away I miss you

    And I will be thinking of you

    Every night and day just

    
    PROMISE ME, YOU'LL WAIT FOR ME,CAUSE I'LL BE SAVING ALL MY LOVE

    FOR YOU, I RATHER BE HOME SOON

    PROMISE ME,  YOU'LL WAIT FOR ME,  I NEED TO KNOW YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY 
   
    TOO,  AND I'LL BE HOME,  I'LL BE HOME SOON


    Instr. couplet 

    When I go away, I'll miss you, and I will be thinking of you

    Every night and day just
