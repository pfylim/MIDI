     INTRO

     No I can't forget this evening, or your face as you were leaving

     But I guess that just the way the story goes

     You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows

     Yes it shows


     No I can't forget tomorrow, when I think of all my sorrow

     When I had you there but then I let you go

     And now it's only fair that I should let you know

     What you should know


     I CAN'T LIVE IF LIVING IS WITHOUT YOU 

     I CAN'T LIVE, I CAN'T GIVE ANYMORE

  M: I CAN'T LIVE IF LIVING IS WITHOUT YOU

     I CAN'T GIVE, I CAN'T GIVE ANYMORE


     Well I can't forget this evening or your face as you were leaving

     But I guess that just the way the story goes

     You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows

     Yes it shows

  M: I CAN'T LIVE IF LIVING IS WITHOUT YOU 

     I CAN'T LIVE, I CAN'T GIVE ANYMORE

     I CAN'T LIVE IF LIVING IS WITHOUT YOU
