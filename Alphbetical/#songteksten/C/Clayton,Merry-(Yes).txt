Title  : Yes
Singer : Merry Clayton


Drivin' around
I just can't hear a sound
'Cept my own wheels turnin'
Wastin' a day
I'm just runnin' away
From a heart that's burnin'
But I can't run forever

CHORUS:
Yes
We're gonne fall in love
And it feels so right
Yes
We're gonna make love
It's gonna be tonight
I can just imagine
Huggin and teasin' and
Lovin' and squeezin' all night

I've made up my mind
He's gonna be mine
i'm so glad I waited
Why did I try
To figure out why
Everything can't be anticipated
I can't wait to tell him

CHORUS
