                   Top of the world


Such a feeling's coming over me
there is wonder in most everything I see
not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes
and I won't be surprised if its a dream

Everything I want the world to be
is now coming true especially for me
and the reason is clear it's because you are near
you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen

Refrain

I'm on the top of the world looking
down on creation and the only explanation I can find
is the love that I found ever since you've been around
your love put me at the top of the world


Something in the wind has learned my name
and it's telling me that things are not the same
in the leafes of the trees in the church of the breeze
there's a pleasin' sense of happiness for me

There is only on wish on my mind
when this day is through I hope that I will find 
that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
all I need will be mine if you are near

Refrain

I'm on the top of the world ...
