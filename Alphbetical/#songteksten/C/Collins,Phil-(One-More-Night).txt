PHIL COLLINS - ONE MORE NIGHT

One more night, one more night
I've been trying on so long to let you know
Let you know how I feel
If I stumble or I fall, just help me back
So I can make you see

Please give me one more night, give me one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me one more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Oh one more night 'cause I can't wait forever

I've been sitting here so long
Wasting time, just staring at the phone
And I was wondering should I call you
Then I thought maybe you're not alone

Please give me one more night, give me just one more night
One more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Please give me one more night just one more night
Oh one more night 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me one more night, just give me one more night
Just give me one more night
'Cause I can't wait forever

Like a river to the sea
I will always be with you
And if you should sail away
I will follow you

Give me one more night, give me just one more night
Oh one more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
I know
There'll never be time when you'll feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind you know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Give me one more night, give me just one more night
One more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
Give me one more night, give me just one more night
One more night, 'cause I can't wait forever
