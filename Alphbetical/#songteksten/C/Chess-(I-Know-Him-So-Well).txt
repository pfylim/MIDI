  7. I Know Him So Well - Chess
  
  Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
  Perfect situations must go wrong
  But this has never yet prevented me
  Wanting far too much for far too long
  Looking back I could have played it differently
  Quite a few more moments who can tell
  But it took time to understand the man
  Now at least I know I know him well
  Wasn't it good? (Was so good)
  Wasn't he fine? (Was so fine)
  Isn't it madness he can be mine
  But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
  More security
  He needs his fantasy and freedom (I know him so well)
  No one in your life is with you constantly
  No one is completely on your side
  And though I moved my world to be with him
  Still the gap between us is too wide
  Looking back I could have made it differently (Made it so differently)
  Lying about the man before I failed (It was good for me to care for)
  But I was never so much younger then (I was so much younger then)
  Now at least I know I know him well (I know I know him well)
  Wasn't it good? (Was so good)
  Wasn't he fine? (Was so fine)
  Isn't it madness he won't be mine
  Didn't I know how it would go
  If I knew from the start?
  Why am I falling apart?
  Wasn't it good?
  Wasn't it fine?
  Isn't it madness he won't be mine
  But in the end he needs a little bit more than me
  More security
  He needs his fantasy and freedom
  I know him so well
  Got the time to understand him
  I know him so well.
