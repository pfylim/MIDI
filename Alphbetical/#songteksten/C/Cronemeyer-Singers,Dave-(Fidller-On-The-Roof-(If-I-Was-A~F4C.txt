4.ANATEVKA - FIDDLER ON THE ROOF  (IF I WAS A RICH MAN) - DAVE CRONEMEYER SINGERS

If I were a rich man
Zzz...
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man.

Wouldn't have to work hard
Zzz...
If I were a biddy biddy rich
Diggy diggy didle didle man.

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen  
Right in the middle of the town
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below
There could be one long staircase just going up
And one even longer coming down
And one more leading nowhere just for show
I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese
And ducks all the time to see and hear
Squawking just as noisily as they can
And each laugh, quack and cluck and gobble and honk
Will land like a trumpet on the ear
As if to say here lives a wealthy man.

If I were a rich man
Zzz...
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man.

Wouldn't have to work hard
Zzz...
Lord who made the lion and the lamb
You decreed I should be what I am
Would it spoil some vast eternal plan
If I were a wealthy man.
