Title  : DEVIL'S GUN

(Words & music: B.Green/R.Roker/G.Shury)

Fee fi fo fum, we're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run, we've gotta get a stand against the devil's gun
We better make a move now
You know there ain't no time to lose now
Well his fingers on the trigger he's waiting to deliver
Can we ever figure out the way to make the people shout

Fee fi fo fum, we're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun
Nowhere to run, we've gotta get a stand against the devil's gun
Gotta new direction, another resurrection yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't wait, hesitate or it's gonna be too late
Flames are getting higher got to jump out of the fire
He's watching us burn, he's watching us burn
One day we will learn, one day we'll learn

Fee fi fo fum
Fee fi fo fum, we're looking down the barrel of the devil's gun

Well his fingers on the trigger and he's waiting to deliver
Can we ever figure out the way to make the devil shout
Don't wait, hesitate or it's gonna be too late
Flames are getting higher, jump out of the fire
