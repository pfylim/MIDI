Artist : CHAS & DAVE

(Words & music: Hodges/Peacock)

Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

You've got a beautiful chin
You've got a beautiful skin
You've got a beautiful face
You've got taste

You've got a beautiful eyes
You've got a beautiful tighs
You've got a lot without a doubt
But I'm thinking 'bout blowing you out

Chorus:
'Cos you won't stop talking
Why don't you give it a rest?
You've got more rabbit that Sainsbury's
It's time you got it off your chest
Now you were just the kind of girl
To break my heart in two
I knew right off
When I first clapped my eyes on you
But how was I to know
You'd bend my ear'oles too
With your incessant talking?
You're becoming a pest
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit

Now you're a wonderful gal
You've got a wonderful smell
You've got wonderful arms
You've got charm
You've got wonderful hair
We make a wonderful pair
Now I don't mind having a chat
But you have to keep giving that

Chorus: ...
