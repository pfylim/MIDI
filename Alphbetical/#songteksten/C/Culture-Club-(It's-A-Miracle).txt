CULTURE CLUB - IT'S A MIRACLE

Guns that cross the street
You never know who you might meet
Who's in disguise
Ooh, as you blow a storm
There's no-one there
To keep you warm
It's no surprise
There's something in my eyes

Refrain:
It's a miracle (5x)
And dreams are made of emotion

Dance with the counterfeit
The plastic smiles and micro heat
And I'll meet you there (I'll meet you there)
Run to the edge of town
Where Hollywood lay it's footprints down
Monroe was there
But do you really care

Refrain: ...

Cry it's a miracle (3x)
Cry

Guns that cross the street
You never know who you might meet
Who's in disguise
Ooh, as you blow a storm
There's no-one there
To keep you warm
It's no surprise
There's something in my eyes
