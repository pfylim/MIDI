Vers 1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
All day long he has fighting for you
and he didn't even know your name
young man come and young man go
but life goes on just the same
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
And I don't know why
why do we keep holding on
I don't know why
pretending to be, oh so strong
oh why
is there somthing I don't know
or something very wrong, with you and me
or maybe.
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do,
that's just the way it is.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

They've been waiting for word to come down
they've been waiting for you night and day
they won't wait any longer for you
it may already be too late.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
And I don't...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You see the dying, you feel the pain
what have you got to say
if we agree that we can disagree
we could stop all of this today

It's been your life for as long as you can remember
but you cannot fight no more
you must want to look your son in the eyes
when he ask you what you did it for.

'Cos

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
And I don't...
