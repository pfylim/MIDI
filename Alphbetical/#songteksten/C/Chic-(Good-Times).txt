Title  : GOOD TIMES

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

Chorus:
Good times, these are here good times
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times
Good times these are the good times
Are you staying all night
Then these are the good times

Happy days are here again
The time is right for makin' friends
Let's get together about a quarter to ten
Come tomorrow let's all do it again

Boys will be boys
Better let them have their toys
Girls will be girls
Cute pony tails and curls
Must put an end to this stress and strife
I think I want to live the sporting life

Chorus: ...

A rumour has it that it's getting late
Time marches on I just can't wait
The clock keeps turning why hesitate
You silly fool you can't change your fate
Let's cut the rug little jive and jitterbug
We want the best we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag, participate
Clans on the half shell and rollerskate

Chorus: ...
