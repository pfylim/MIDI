Singer : CATS 
Title  : WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER

I think about you when I don't want to
Dream about your smiling face
And I keep trying not to love you
But I love you anyway

We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied

I have talked to come to know you
Come to need your company
And what will I do if I can't have you
If I can't have you what will I do

We should be together, together
We should be walking side by side
We should be together, together
Keeping each other satisfied
