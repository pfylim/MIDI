
10. Caught In The Act - My Arms Keep Missing You

You know
I've been so lonely ev'ry night
Since you went away
Would you let
Me down every night
Is that the way you're made, girl?

I keep telling myself
It's all right
Even though I cry
There no question why
How could I be happy when
My arms keep missing you
Who's been kissing you
Since you went away
My arms keep missing you
I keep wishing 
You'd come back today
You said 
You wouldn't hurt me anyway
And I believe in you
We said we trust each other every day
We'd never be untrue
But I keep thinking you're telling lies
Even though I try
There's no question why
How can I be happy when

Chorus......
