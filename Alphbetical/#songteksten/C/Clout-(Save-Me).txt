  11. SAVE ME - CLOUD
  
  Save me
  Take me away
  To the moonlight
  The people around me
  Don't feel right
  What are we doing?
  
  Save me 
  Take me away
  From the action
  For you are the only attraction
  Take me away
  From here.
  
  The party's on
  And one by one
  The cars arrived
  And the people come
  And I wonder 
  If there will be anybody
  Here alone?
  
  An ordinary guy
  Tries to catch my eye
  Should I smile or
  Should I sigh? 
  Then you walked through the door
  And I saw that you were all on your own.
  
  Save me
  Take me away to the moonlight
  The people around me
  Don't feel right
  What are we doing here?
  
  Come on
  Save me
  Let's get away from the action
  For you are the only attraction
  Take me away from here.
  
  We slipped away
  Without a single word
  No one saw and no one heard
  'Cause we both agreed
  That it just wasn't worth it to stay.
  
  I went to cold and hot
  Should I go or not?
  You grabbed my hand
  And I couldn't stop
  And I laughed and you smiled
  As we left and drove away.
  
  Save me
  Take me away to the moonlight
  The people around me
  Don't feel right
  What are we doing here?
  
  Come on
  Save me
  Let's get away from the action
  For you are the only attraction
  Take me away from here.
  
  Starlit sky
  Moon on high
  Sure feels good to me
  And in my bones
  I've always known
  This is how it's meant to be.
  
  Save me
  Take me away to the moonlight
  The people around me
  Don't feel right
  What are we doing here?
  
  Save me
  Let's get away from the action
  For you are the only attraction
  Take me away from here.
  
  Save me

  Don't feel right
  What are we doing here?
  
  Save me

  For you are the only attraction
  Take me away from here.
