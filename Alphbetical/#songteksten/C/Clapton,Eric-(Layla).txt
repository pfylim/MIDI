And what'll you do when you get lonely,
when nobody's waiting by your side ?
And you've been running 
and hidding much too long,
you know it's just your foolish pride.

Lay-la, you got me on my knees.
Lay-la, I'm begging darlin' please.
Lay-la, darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.

Tried to give you consolation,
and your old man won't let you down.
Like a fool I fell in love with you,
I turned the whole world upside down.

Lay-la, you got me on my knees.
Lay-la, I'm begging darlin' please.
Lay-la, darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.

Let's make the best of the situation,
before I fin'lly go insane.
Please don't say that we'll never find away,
and tell me all my love's invain.

Lay-la, you got me on my knees.
Lay-la, I'm begging darlin' please.
Lay-la, darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.

Lay-la, you got me on my knees.
Lay-la, I'm begging darlin' please.
Lay-la, darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.

You got me on my knees.
Lay-la, I'm begging darlin' please.
Lay-la, darlin' won't you ease my worried mind.
