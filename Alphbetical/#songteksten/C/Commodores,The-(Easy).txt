Singer : COMMODORES 
Title  : EASY

(Words & music: Lionel Richie)

Know it sounds funny 
But I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah
Ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

Why in the world would anybody put chains on me
I've paid my dues to make it
Everybody wants me to be what they want me to be
I'm not happy when I try to fake it, no
Ooh, that's why I'm easy

I wanna be high so high
I wanna be free to know the thing I do, alright
Wanna be free, just free
