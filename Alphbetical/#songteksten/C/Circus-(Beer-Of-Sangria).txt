Singer : CIRCUS 
Title  : BEER OR SANGRIA

If you wanna go to Espana
Torero's fiesta and fun
You take a plane go manana
Flamenco siesta and sun

Do you like beer or sangria sangria sangria
Do you like beer or sangria sangria sangria

Mama came along for a song and amore
Alright alright o.k.
Papa is here for the beer and the toros
Ole ole ole
While you dance with a young senorita
Your yesterday problems are gone
Whisper in the ear of Pepita
What do you drink corazon

Do you like beer or sangria sangria sangria
Do you like beer or sangria sangria sangria
