Don't change your mind;
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doin' fine;
if you decide to leave I won't go under.
You know I've come this far without you.
It won't be to hard too be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
so I won't be spending too much time at home
I'm agonna miss you.
I'm agonna miss you, baby, yeah.
I can't forgive you.
Still, I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind
I don't need to hear your side of the story.
Your friends all said we had a future,
but I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you,
and how glad they'll be when you decide to go.
Still I'm gonna miss you
I'm gonna  miss you, baby, yeah.
I can't forgive you.
miss you, miss you, baby.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to pay.
If you think you're better off without me,
just remember, it's a dirty world out there.
Think I'm gonna miss you.
Think I'm gonna miss you baby.
Can't forgive you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on.
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm givin' up forgettin' ya, baby.
I've  got crazy plans for you.
