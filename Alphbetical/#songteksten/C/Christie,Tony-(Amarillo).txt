  SHALALALALALALALA
  (REPEAT 3 TIMES)
  
  WHEN THE DAY IS DAWNING
  ON A TEXAS SUNDAY MORNING
  HOW I LONG TO BE THERE
  WITH MARIE WHO'S WAITING FOR ME THERE
  
  EVERY LONELY CITY WHERE I HANG MY HAT
  AIN'T AS HALF AS PRETTY
  AS WHERE MY BABY'S AT
  
  IS THIS THE WAY TO AMARILLO
  EVERY NIGHT I'VE BEEN HUGGING MY PILLOW
  DREAMING DREAMS OF AMARILLO
  AND SWEET MARIE WHO WAITS FOR ME
  
  SHALALALALALALALA
  (REPEAT 3 TIMES)
  AND MARIE WHO WAITS FOR ME
  
  THERE'S A CHURCHBELL RINGING
  
  HEAR THE SONG OF JOY THAT IS SINGING
  FOR SWEET MARIA
  AND THE GUY WHO'S COMING TO SEE HER
  JUST BEYOND THE HIGH WAY
  THERE'S AN OPEN PLAIN
  AND IT KEEPS ME GOING
  THROUGH THE WIND AND RAIN
  
  IS THIS THE WAY TO AMARILLO
  EVERY NIGHT I'VE BEEN HUGGING MY PILLOW
  DREAMING DREAMS OF AMARILLO
  AND SWEET MARIE WHO WAITS FOR ME
  
  SHALALALALALALALA
  SHALALALALALALALA
  SHALALALALALALALA
  AND MARIE WHO WAITS FOR ME
