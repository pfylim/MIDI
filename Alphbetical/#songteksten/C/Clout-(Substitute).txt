Singer : CLOUT 
Title  : SUBSTITUTE

(Words & music: W. H. Wilson)

Sam, you've been waiting much too long now
It looks like she's not coming home
Sam, you've been loyal true and faithful
All this time you've been alone
If I could get that same dedication
I'd give you everything in creation

Chorus:
If she doesn't come back
If she doesn't come back
I'll be your substitute 
Whenever you want me
Don't you know I'll be your substitute 
Whenever you need me

Sam, every day you've waited for her
I've been waiting here for you and
Sam, all this time I've been lonely
I know what you're going through
I'll wait until my chances occur
But you can't keep relying on her

Chorus: ...

Each day by your window, you sit and cry
Hoping to see her face
Oh, you might as well forget about her
And find someone to take her place

Chorus: ...
