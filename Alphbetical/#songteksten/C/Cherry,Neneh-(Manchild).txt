NENEH CHERRY - MANCHILD

OK you're on your own it's late your girlfriend is on another date
With the hero in your dream turn around ask yourself
So you think you're gonna win this time manchild

Is it the pain of the drinking
Or the Sunday sinking feeling
The car never seems to work
When it's late your girlfriend's on a date
And the hero with her in your dream
In your sleep it seemed like you
Turn around ask yourself
Turn around ask yourself

Manchild will you ever win
Manchild look at the state you're in

Could you go undercover
And sell your brand new lover could you
Be someone else will love you
You'd sell your soul for a tacky song
Like the ones you hear on the radio
Turn around ask yourself
Turn around and ask yourself

Refrain:
Manchild will you ever win
Manchild look at the state you're in
Manchild he will make you cry
Manchild, manchild, manchild

From Monday down to Friday
You're working on another man's car
Or is it in the factory
It doesn't matter where you are

Just turn around and ask yourself is this communication
Accentuate the positive and give some illustration
See manchild you're no on I turn the microphone on
Control communication when I'm kicking it and so on
To the point that I need the air that I breathe
Into an audience that's waiting and ecstatic to receive
For the meantime another mean rhyme I keep on saying it
I know what the time is and the crowd will keep playing it
Through the speaker boxes loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles and words in steady doses
Just believe that all you need is the air that you breathe
Turn around and ask yourself

Refrain: ...

He's the apple of your eye

Once bitten twice shy why don't you bite me again
Just take it right and go tell your friend
Are you ready for the words I turn the microphone on
A figure of speech to reach you at the back 
And so on the style I'm stimulating dance floors
Raise your body temperature now and this demands for
Power in the amp and you know loud's my diagnosis
'Cause I believe in miracles words in heavy doses
