Title  : TEENYBOPPERBAND

Big hand for the teenybopperband
Big hand for the teenybopperband

What's going on
Is there something wrong
In the rockscene of today
If you're looking good
Wear a glitter suit
Then you'll make it anyway

The kids are gonna scream and shout
Do they know what this is all about

Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband
Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband

Big hand for the teenybopperband
Big hand for the teenybopperband

From bottom to top
Seems an easy job
You're a big one from now on
You change your dinky wreck
Into a cadillac
People think it's easy done

The kids are gonna scream and shout
Do they know what this is all about

Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband
Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband

Big hand for the teenybopperband
Big hand for the teenybopperband

Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband
Ah ah teenybopperband teenybopperband
