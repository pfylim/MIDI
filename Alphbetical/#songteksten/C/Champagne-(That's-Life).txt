Till you're gonna want me
Till you're gonna need me
Till you're gonna love me, ah ah ah

Till you're gonna want me, I'm lazy
Till you're gonna need me, and I'm crazy, lady
Till you're gonna love me, you don't know what
I'm gonna do-do-do
I'm gonna be fascinated and maybe

Till you're gonna want me, no money
Till you're gonna need me, to give to you, honey
Till you're gonna love me, I'm living a disco-life
That's why

Maybe you're a good dancer
Maybe you're alright tonight

That's life baby, life
That's life baby, life
That's life baby, life

Till you're gonna want me
Till you're gonna need me
Till you're gonna love me, ah ah ah

Till you're gonna want me, no sunshine
Till you're gonna need me, I need moonlight, baby
Till you're gonna love me, watch it what you're 
Gonna do-do-do
I'm gonna be fascinated and maybe

Till you're gonna want me, it's funny
Till you're gonna need me, surprising, honey
Till you're gonna love me, you're living a disco-life
That's why

Maybe you're a good dancer
Maybe you're alright tonight

That's life baby, life that's why I need you, baby
That's life baby, life to see you boogie, baby
That's life baby, life that's why I need you, baby

Maybe you're a good dancer
Maybe you're alright tonight

You know, you know, you know, I'm lazy
You know, you know, you know, I'm crazy, lazy
