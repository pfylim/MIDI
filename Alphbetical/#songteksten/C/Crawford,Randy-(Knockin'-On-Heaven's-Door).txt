Title  : Knockin' On Heaven's Door
Singer : Randy Crawford


Mama, take this badge off of me 
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark for me to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door (2x)

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them any mote
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door (2x)


Words & Music : Bob Dylan
