               Proud Mary             CCR
   

Lookin' for a job in the city,
wakin' for the man ev'ry night and day,
an' I never lost a minute o' sleepin',
worryin' 'bout the way things might 'ave been.

Big wheel keep on turnin', proud Mary keep on burnin',
rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river.

Cleaned a lot o' plates in Memphis,
pumped a lot o' pain down in New Orleans,
but I never saw the good side of a city,
'til I hitched a ride on a riverboat queen.

Big wheel keep on turnin', proud Mary keep on burnin',
rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river.

Solo

Rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river.

If you come down to the river,
bet ya gonna find some people who live,
you don't have to worry, if ya have no money,
people on the river are happy to give.

Big wheel keep on turnin', proud Mary keep on burnin',
rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river,
rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river,
rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river,
rollin, rollin', rollin' on the river.
