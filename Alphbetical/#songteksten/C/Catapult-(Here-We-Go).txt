I got a pretty baby by my side
She's driving me crazy, that's what I like
We use to go out every saturday night
Me and my baby were feeling alright

To the movies and to the shore
We have a good time on the dancing floor
Rocking and jiving side by side
Keeping each other satisfied

Refrain:
Here we go
You got to rock,
And I got to roll
Here we go
Together we will have a ball
Here we go
I need some rock
And you need some roll
Here we go
Together we can have it all

Having fun and looking for more
We don't like to pay,
So we sneak out the back door
Rocking and jiving side by side
Keeping each other satisfied

And when it's over, 
Got to take you home
I'm alone
But next saturday
I'll be there again

Here we go
You got to rock
I got to roll
Here we go
Together we will have a ball
Here we go
A little bit of rock
A little bit of roll
