Title  : PEOPLE ALONE
Artist : RANDY CRAWFORD

(Words & music: Will Jennings/Lalo Schifrin)

Take me along
I don't care where you have gone
And I don't have to know
Exactly where you're going

If you leave me behind
Then everything on your mind
Will turn to pictures of the world
We might have been

Chorus:
People alone may go very fast
But maybe not so far
Playing alone is still solitaire
Remember: people alone may reach for a love
But only half as well
People alone may seem satisfied
How can they tell?

If we're crossing the line
Where there's no yours and no mine
We'll find it easy to see
People should be together

Chorus: ...

Take me along
Let's not be people alone
I'm on your mind
So please don't leave me behind
Crossing the line
Where there's no yours and no mine
