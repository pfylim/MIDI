Oh well he's got a hold on my heart,
my lust and my everything.
He's thrown it around and around and
i'm screaming, don't bring me down.

Oh well I took control of his fire
and it kept me warm all night long.
Now I find it hard to control the desire
to keep it burning on.
Oh well his love is strong as strong can be.
Oh well his love is strong enough for me.

I've got an angel.
I've got an angel.
I've got an angel.
I've got an angel.

Oh well took control of his fire
and it kept me warm all night long.
Now I find it hard to control the desire
to keep it burning on.
Oh well his love is strong as strong can be.
Oh well his love is strong enough for me.
Oh well his love is strong as strong can be.
Oh well his love is strong enough for me.

Heavens above no I can't get enough.
Heavens above no I can't get enough.
Heavens above no I can't get enough.
Heavens above no I can't get enough.

Oh well his love.
