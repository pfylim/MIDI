Running wide, for 24 hours
Girl I want to hold you tight
I cannot sleep 'cause I feel a power inside
It's going round, in my mind
You make me so crazy for love, crazy for love

I can't get enough for you love, baby
I can't get enough for you love, for you love,       2 x
What-ever I do, I'm thinking of you
uh--You know it's true

And heaven knows how much I've been praying
Now I've found my perfect love
It's so extreme, I mean what I'm saying to you
Oh I cannot get enough
You make me so crazy for love, crazy for love

I can't get enough for you love, baby
I can't get enough for you love, for you love
