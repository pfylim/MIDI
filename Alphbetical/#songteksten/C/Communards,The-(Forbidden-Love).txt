Our love is like forbidden fruit
but we take each bite with pride not shame
in this garden where the bitter poison rots.
But all the same....we shall
stand so strong so proud
give in to prejudice.
Behind closed doors we have to kiss
but I long to hold your hand in the rain.
Watching accepted lovers expressing
tenderness and joy
makes an anger stir in me for
something i can't truly have.
Like a young boy who's denied his favourite toy
I just want to scream
and demonstrate my resistance
just demonstrate my resistance
demonstrate my resistance.
Our love is like forbidden fruit
but we take each bite with pride not shame
in this garden where the bitter poison rots.
But all the same every day brings another tear.
Behind each stare lies a hidden tear
Someday soon we will have our day
until then our love forbidden stays
our love forbidden stays.
Our love is like forbidden fruit.
Our love is like forbidden fruit.
Our love is like forbidden fruit.
Our love is like forbidden fruit,
like forbidden fruit, like forbidden fruit.
