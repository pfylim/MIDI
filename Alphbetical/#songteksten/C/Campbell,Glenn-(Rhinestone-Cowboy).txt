I've been walking these streets so long
Singing the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away
Like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm going to be
Where the lights are shining on me.

Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Riding out on a horse
In a star spangle rodeo
Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Getting cards and letters
From people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone.

Well, I really don't mind the rain
And the smile can hide all the pain
But your down when you're riding the train
That's taking the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar
To pin inside my shoes
There'll be a load of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But I'm going to be
Where the lights are shining on me.

Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Riding out on a horse
In a star spangle rodeo
Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Getting cards and letters
From people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone.

Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Riding out on a horse
In a star spangle rodeo
Like a Rhinstone cowboy
Getting cards and letters
From people I don't even know
And offers coming over the phone.
