I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW THE RAIN IS GONE
I CAN SEE ALL OBSTACLES IN MY WAY
GONE ARE THE DARK CLOUDS THAT HAD ME DOWN
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY

OH YES I CAN MAKE IT NOW THE PAIN IS GONE
ALL OF THE BAD FEELINGS HAVE DISAPPEARED
HERE IS THAT RAINBOW I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY

LOOK ALL AROUND THERE'S NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES
LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD THERE'S NOTHING BUT BLUE SKIES

I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW THE RAIN IS GONE
I CAN SEE ALL OBSTACLES IN MY WAY
HERE IS THAT RAINBOW I'VE BEEN PRAYING FOR
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
BRI-RI-RI-RI-RIGHT
BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
OH YEAH
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY
IT'S GONNA BE A BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT SUN SHINY DAY.
