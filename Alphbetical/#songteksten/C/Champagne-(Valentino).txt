Singer : CHAMPAGNE 
Title  : VALENTINO

(Words & music: Martin Duiser/Wally Tax/Janschen en Janschens)

I saw a picture of someone, whose name I didn't know
A silent movie, with Rudi, was on the midnight show
And when he touched her ear
It was in Blood and Sand
His eyes like fire took my heart away

Chorus:
Valentino, if I fell in love and all the stars above
Were shining bright, my love
Valentino, all my pride and pain are driving me insane
And all my problems remain
Oh would you like to dance, Valentino, you're the only one
Oh would you take a chance, Valentino, I would love to run
But I can't stand, running alone you know, I need someone

You are a dancer, romancer, but what am I to do
You are the answer, sweet dancer, but will you love me too
If I am dressed in black, will you be come back
Will you believe in me, please stay with me

Chorus: ...
