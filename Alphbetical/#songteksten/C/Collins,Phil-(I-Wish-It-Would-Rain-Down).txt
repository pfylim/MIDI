You know I never meant to see you again
and I only passed by as a friend
all this time I stayed out of sight
I started wondering why ?

Now I, I wish it would rain down, down on me
yes I wish it would rain rain down on me now

You said you didn't need me in your life
I guess you were right
well I never meant to cause you no pain
but it looks like I did it again

Now I, I wish it would rain down, down on me
yes I wish it would rain rain down on me now

Though your hurt is gone, mines hanging on, inside
and I know, it's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign

'Cos I know, I know I never meant to cause you no pain
and I realise I let you down
but I know in my heart of hearts
I knwe I'm never gonna hold you again

Now I, I wish it would rain down, down on me
yes I wish it would rain rain down on me now.
