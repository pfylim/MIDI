Title  : I've Got U Under My Skin
Singer : Neneh Cherry


I've got you under my skin
I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're really a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I tried so not to give in
I said to myself, 'This affair never will go so well'
But why should I try to resist
When, darling, I know so well
I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrifice anything, come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats and repeats in my ear
'Don't you know, little fool, you never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality'
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'Cause I've got you under my skin
