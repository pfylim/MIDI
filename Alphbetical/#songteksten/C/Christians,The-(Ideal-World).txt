THE CHRISTIANS - IDEAL WORLD

Before you point the finger
I'd hope the whole thing disappears
Remember empty words will fall
And fall upon the deafest ears
He won't give in without a fight
And foul play without a doubt
No silver lining to be seen
In this thunder cloud
Oh that's not allowed

In the ideal world
We'd be free to choose
But in my real world
Oh you can bet we're gonna lose

Your money fills their pockets
Fears fills their tiny minds
At least the world is talking now
This ain't no way to treat mankind no
A sudden blackout stops the show
But doesn't stop the way I am
'Cause all my life I've been oppressed
You're not the first to say I am
I do all I can

For an ideal world
Where we're free to choose
But in my real world
Oh you can bet we're gonna lose
In the ideal world
We can start again
But my real world
Hangs on the color of your skin

We could be free forever
If they would only change
But fools never change no no

A speck of blue up in the sky
A song of hope a noble thought
But how long must the people die
Before the guilty ones are caught
Oh will you spare a thought

For an ideal world
Where we're free to choose
For an ideal world
And we're no longer born to lose
In the ideal world
We can start again
Now in my real world
Let's put an end to suffering
End suffering

In the ideal world
(We're not free to choose)
Oh in my real world
Oh we are safe to air our views
In the ideal world
(We can start again)
Now in my real world
It matters not about the color of your skin
(Ideal world free to choose ideal world)
Oh we no longer make the news
(Ideal world start again ideal world)
