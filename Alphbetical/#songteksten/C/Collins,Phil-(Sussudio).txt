Title  : Sussudio
Singer : Phil Collins


There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time SUSSUDIO
Now she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same
SUSSUDIO oh oh oh
If she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere

Chorus:
She's all I need
All of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word
SUSSUDIO
Just say the word
SUSSUDIO

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun
SUSSUDIO
Give me a chance give me a sign
I show her any time
SUSSUDIO
I've got to have her have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how

She makes me nervous
And makes me scared
But I feel so good if I just say the word
SUSSUDIO
Just say the word 
SUSSUDIO

Chorus
