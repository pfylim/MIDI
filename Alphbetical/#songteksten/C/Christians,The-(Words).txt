Title  : Words
Singer : The Christians


If I could find words to tell you I'm sorry
Make you understand I mean just what I say
After all that I've heard, well why should I worry
When we ride the fine line between love and hate

If I had been wise, oh how could I doubt you
Now I'm all alone, my life in disarray
But try as I might I can't live without you
So I cling to the hope of a brighter day

Chorus:
Oh I know we've been through this all before
How can I prove my love for you is real
No I can't do anymore ... If I could only find words
(and still he has dreams)
And still I must learn to cope
(absurd as it seems)
I still have hope

If I had good sense and heed all the warnings
I would let it be and leave all well alone
But there's no recompense for waking up mornings
Feeling sure it's myself who's the foolish one

Chorus
