Title  : THIS WILL BE

This will be an everlasting love
I'm so glad he found me in time
This will be the one I have waited for
I am so glad that rectified my mind
This will be the first time and one has loved
This will be an everlasting love for me
Oh, me oh lovin', you are something of wonderful
Because you've shown me just how much you care
You've given me the thrill of a live time
And make me believe you've got more thrills
to spare, oh!
This will be an everlasting love
Oh yes it will now
You've brought a lot of sunshine into my life
You've filled me with happiness I knew
You gave me more than I ever dreamed of
And no one no one can't take the place of you
This will be you and me
Yes sure eternally
Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing
together for ever
This will be you and me
