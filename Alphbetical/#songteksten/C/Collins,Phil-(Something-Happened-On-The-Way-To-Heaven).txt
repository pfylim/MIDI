We had a life, we had a love
but you don't know what you've get til you lose it
well that was then and this is now
and I want you back
how many times can I say I'm sorry

I only wanted you as someone to love
but something happenend on the way to heaven
it got a hold of me, and wouldn't let go
and I want you back
how many times can I say I'm sorry

You can run and you can hide
but I'm not leaving less you come with me
we've had our problems but I'm on your side
you're all I need, please believe in me

How can something so good, go so bad
something so right, go so wrong
I don't know, I don't have all the answers
but I want you back
how many times can I say I'm sorry

They say you can't take it with you
when you go
and I believe it
but taking what I've got or being
here with you, you know
I'd rather leave it

You can run and you can hide
but I'm not leaving less you come with me
we've had our problems but I'm on your side
you're all I need, please believe in me.
