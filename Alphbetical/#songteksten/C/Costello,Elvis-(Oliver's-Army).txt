Singer : ELVIS COSTELLO 
Title  : OLIVER'S ARMY

(Words & music: Elvis Costello)

Don't start me talking
I could talk all night
My mind goes sleepwalking
While I'm putting the world to right
Called careers information
Have you got yourself an occupation

Chorus:
Oliver's army is here to stay
Oliver's army are on their way
And I would rather be anywhere else
But here today

There was a checkpoint Charlie
He didn't crack a smile
But it's no laughing party
When you've been on the murder mile
Only takes one itchy trigger
One more widow, one less white ligger

Chorus: ...

Hong Kong is up for brabs
London is full of abs
We could be in Palestine
Overrun by a Chinese line
With the boys from the Mersey
And the Thames and the Tyne
But there's no danger
It's a professional career
Though it could be arranged
With just one word in Mr. Churchill's ear
If you're out of luck or out of work
We could sen you to Johannesburg

Chorus: ...
