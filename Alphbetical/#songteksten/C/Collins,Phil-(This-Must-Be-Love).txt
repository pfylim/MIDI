Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling
This must be love
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Well I wait in every day, just in case,
you decide to call
and I can hardly wait, 'cos I never thought time
could pass so slowly

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This must be...
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again,
but now I know
it's you that I've been looking for
and day by day more and more

don't tell me I know
but this feeling inside my heart,
you know I'm never letting go
'cos I think that...

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This must be...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Words can only say so much
it's hard to express
the things you do to me
You've everything I could ever dreamed
you'd be.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This must be...
