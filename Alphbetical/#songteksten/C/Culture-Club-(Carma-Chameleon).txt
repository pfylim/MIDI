Title  : Karma Chameleon
Singer : Culture Club


Desert loving in your eyes all the day
If listen to your lies would you say
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

Chorus:
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon
You come and go, you come and go
Loving would be easy if your colours
Were like my dream
Red, gold and green, red gold and green

Didn't hear your wicked words every day
And you used to be so sweet I heard you say
That my love was an addiction
When we cling, our love is strong
When you go, you're gone forever
You string along, you string along

Chorus

Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
Every day is like survival
You're my lover, not my rival
I'm a man without conviction
I'm a man who doesn't know
How to sell a contradiction
You come and go, you come and go

Chorus
