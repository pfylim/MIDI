Just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

I could say "day" and you'd say "night",
tell me it's black when I know that it's white.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

I could leave but I won't go, 
though my heart might tell me so.
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes.
So why does it always seem to be me looking at you,
you looking at me ?

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

Turning me on, turning me off, making me feel
like I want too much.
Living with you's just a 
putting me through it all of the time.
Running around, staying out all night,
taking it all 'stead of taking one bite.

Living with you's just a 
putting me through it all of the time.
I could leave but I want go, 
well it'd be easier I know.
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes.
Why does it always seem to be me looking at you,
you looking at me.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

Truth is I love you more than I wanted to.
There's no point in trying to pretend.
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do.
Say we'll be together 'til the end.

I could leave but I want go, 
well it'd be easier I know.
I can't feel a thing from my head down to my toes.
So why does it always seem to be me looking at you,
you looking at me.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

But I love you more than I wanted to.
There's no point in trying to pretend.
There's been no one who makes me feel like you do.
Say we'll be together 'til the end.

But just as I thought it was going alright
I find out I'm wrong when I thought I was right.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.

Well I could say "day" and you'd say "night",
tell me it's black when I know that it's white.

S' always the same; it's just a shame that's all.
That's all.
