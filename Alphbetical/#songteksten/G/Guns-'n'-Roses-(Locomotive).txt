Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
yeah I'll find a way to cure tha pain
if I said that you're my friend
and our love would never end
how long before I had your trust again
I openend up the doors when it was cold outside
hopin' that you'd find your own way in
but how can I protect you
or try not to neglect you
when you won't take the love  I have to give
I bought me an illusion
an I put it on the wall
I let it fill my head with dreams
and I had to have them all
but oh the taste is never so sweet
as what you'd believe it is
well I gues it never is
it's these prejudiced illusions
that pump the blood
to the heart of the biz

You know I never thought
that it could take so long
you know never knew how to be strong
yeah I let you shape me
but I feel as though you raped me
'cause you climbed inside my world
and in my songs
so now I've closed tha door
to keep the cold outside
seems somehow I've found the will to live
but how can I forget you
or try not to reject you
when we both know it takes time to forgive

Sweetness is a virtue
and you lost your virtue long ago
you know I'd like to hurt you
but my conscience always tells me no
you could sell your body on the street
to anyone whom you might meet
who'd love to try and get inside
and bust your innocence open wide

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
my baby's gone off the track
my baby's got a locomotive
gotta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
take a closer look I'm not to blame
no

Gonna have some fun with my frustrations
gonna watch the big screen in my head
I'd rather take a detour
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer
your train of thought has cut me off again
better tame that boy cause he's a wild one
better tame that boy for he's a man
sweetheart don't make me laugh
you's gettin' too big for your pants
and I's think maybe you should
cut out while you can
you can use your illusion
let it take you where it may
we live and learn
and then sometimes it's best to walk away
me I'm just here hangin' on
it's my only place to stay at least
for now anyway
I've worked too hard for my illusions
just to throw them all away

I'm taking time for quiet consolation
in passing by this love that's passed away
I know it's never easy
so why should you believe me
when I've always got so many thing to say
calling off the dogs a simple choice is made
'cause playful hearts
can sometimes be enraged
you know I tried to wake you
I mean how long could it take you
to open up your eyes and turn the page

Kindness is a treasure
and it's one towards me you've seldom shown
so I'll say it for good measure
to all the ones like you I've known
ya know I'd like to shave your head
and all my friends could paint it red
'cause love to me's a two way street
an all I really want is peace

But my baby's got a locomotive
my baby's gone off the track
my baby's got a locomotive
gotta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
take a closer look I'm not to blame
no

Affections is a blessing
can you find it in your sordid heart
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether
but the tremor tore my pad apart
yeah I know it's hard to face
when all we've worked for's gone to waste
but you're such a stupid woman
and I'm such a stupid man
but love like time's got its own plans

'Cause my baby's got a locomotive
my baby's gone off the track
my baby's got a locomotive
gotta peel the bitch off my back
I know it looks like I'm insane
take a closer look I'm not to blame
yeah
