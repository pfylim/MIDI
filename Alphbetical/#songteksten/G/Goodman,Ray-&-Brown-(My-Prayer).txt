Title  : MY PRAYER
Artist : RAY, GOODMAN & BROWN

(Words & music: Jim Kennedy/George Boulanger)

When the twilight is gone
And no songbird is singing
When the twilight is gone
You come into my heart
And here in my heart you will stay
While I pray

Chorus:
My prayer is to linger with you
At the end of the day
In a dream that's divine
My prayer, is a rapture in blue
With the world far away and your lips close to mine
Tonight, while our hearts are at glow
Oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know

My prayer, and the answer you give
May they still be the same for as long as we live
That you'll always be there
At the end of my prayer, of my prayer
Of my prayer
