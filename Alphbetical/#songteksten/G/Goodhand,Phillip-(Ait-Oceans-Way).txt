Title  : AIT - OCEANS AWAY

(Words & music: Philip Goodhand-Tait)

Don't wake me up if I should be dreaming
I don't want to miss one minute of this dream
Don't worry now, you're not dreaming
I'll love you always where ever you be

Oceans away, go where you may
Love will be with you, oceans away
Love will be with you, oceans away

The night is old but day is certain
No twilight zone can last very long
Darkness my friend I hide in your curtain
If you're not here with me, please let me dream on

Oceans away, go where you may
Love will be with you, oceans away
Love will be with you, oceans away
