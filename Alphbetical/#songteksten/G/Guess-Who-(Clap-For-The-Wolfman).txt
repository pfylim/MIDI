Singer : GUESS WHO 
Title  : CLAP FOR THE WOLFMAN

Refrain:
Clap for the Wolfman, he gon' rate your record high
Clap for the Wolfman, you gon' dog him till
The day you die

Da doo ron ron and the Duke of Earl
They were friends of mine
I was on my moonlight drive
Snugged in, said baby just one kiss she said no no no
Romance ain't keepin' me alive ah ah ah
So I was left out in the cold
I said: you're what I been dreamin' of
I sit alone at night and watch TV
She said I don't want to know

Refrain: ...

75 or 80 miles an hour she hollered slow slow slow
Baby I can't stop right now on a dime
Said, hey baby gimme just one kiss she said no no no
But how was I to bide my time
Said her babe, you wanna coo coo coo? she said ah ah ah
Said I'm about to overload
I said, you're what I been living for
She said I don't want to know
Refrain: ...
