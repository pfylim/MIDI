Singer : GENESIS 
Title  : FOLLOW YOU, FOLLOW ME

(Words & music: Collins/Rutherford/Banks)

Stay with me
My love I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you 
Oh my love

In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

Chorus:
I will follow you, will you follow me
All the days and nights that we know will be
I will stay with you, will you stay with me
Just one single tear in each passing year

With the dark
I see so very clear now
All my tears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long but you are there
Close at hand I'm better for the smile you give
And while live

Chorus: ...
