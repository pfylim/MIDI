Singer : GUYS 'N DOLLS
Title  : OUR SONG

(Words & music: Gerard Stellaard/Grant/Griggs/Javelon)

I'm on my own, just feeling lost
Still wondering why, what life had caused
But deep inside, I feel the need to turn around
It all went wrong, how sad's my song

Don't fall below
You need a friend
Just on your own
So take my hand

And so our song will be in perfect harmony
It won't go wrong, so join our song
And so our song will be in perfect harmony
This is our song

Just see him go, losing his face
And then it shows, but not too late

We're here for you, to show
Your song was out of key
It won't go wrong
Our happy song

This song's for you to show
We're here to set you free
It won't go wrong
Come sing our song
