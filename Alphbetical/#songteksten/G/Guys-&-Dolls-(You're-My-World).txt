Title  : YOU'RE MY WORLD

(Words & music: C. Sigman/U. Bindi)

You're my world
You're every breath I take
You're my world
You're every move I make
Other eyes see the stars
Up in the skies
But for me they shine
Within your eyes
As the trees reach
For the sun above
So my arms reach out
To you for love
With your hand resting in mine
I feel a power so define

Refrain:
You're my world
You are my night and day
You're my world
You're every prayer I pray
If our love ceases to be
Then it's the end
Of my world for me
