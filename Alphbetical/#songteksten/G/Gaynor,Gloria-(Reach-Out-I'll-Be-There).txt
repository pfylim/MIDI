Title  : REACH OUT I'LL BE THERE

Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumbling down
Darling reach out, reach out
I'll be there, with a love that will shelter you
Love that will see you through

When you feel lost and about to give up
'Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting but all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling reach out, reach out
I'll be there, to love and comfort you

And I'll be there to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, to always see you through
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no place of mind to be found

(spoken)
I know what you're thinking
You're alone now no love of your own

But darling reach out, reach out

(spoken)
Just look over your shoulder

I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there you can always depend on me
