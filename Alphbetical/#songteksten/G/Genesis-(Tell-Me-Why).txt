Titel:        TELL ME WHY

Interpret:    GENESIS

Mothers crying in the street
children dying at their feet, tell me why
people starving everywhere
there's too much food but none to spare, tell me why

Can you see that shaft of sunlight
can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire
that's burning
anger and hope so deep
so deep within my heart
before my eyes
for some it's too late
it seems there's no-one listening

People sleeping
in the streets
no roof above, no food
to eat, tell me why
see the questions
in their eyes
listen to their children's
cries, tell me why

If there's a God,
is he watching
can he give a ray of hope
so much pain and so much sorrow
tell me what does he see
when he looks at you
when he looks at me
what would he say
it seems there's no-one listening

Who would think it
still could happen
even in this time and place
politicians, they may save themselves
but they won't save their face
just hope against hope
it's not to late

You say there's nothing you can do
is there one rule for them and one for you,
tell me why

Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight
can you see it in my eyes
I can feel the fire that's burning
anger and hope so deep
so deep within my
heart before my eyes
for some it's too late
it seems there's no-one listening
