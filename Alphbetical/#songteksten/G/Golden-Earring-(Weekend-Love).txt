Title  : WEEKEND LOVE

(Words & music: Barry Hay/George Kooymans)

The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a long time since the day I met her
I can't handle being without her one more day

Gonna get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these cold cliches

You better hurry up
Baby, I ain't lying
We're down to nothing but a waste of time
Still remember everything she said
Make no problems, make no debts
All I want is your one day weekend love

She nips her wine without a flinching
She's in control of it all the way
Looks so good
Pretending that she's listening
By the time I fall asleep
She's gone away

She's got no mercy
On a jealous heart
And she said it all right from the start
Make no problems, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess

Chorus:
I want more than just a one day weekend love
I want more than just a one day weekend love
All she wants is just my one day weekend love

The sooner it will be the better
Gonna have to see her right away
It's been a week now since she's been around here
Gonna get the feeling that I'm going insane
Feel so stupid using these cold cliches
I can't handle being without her one more day
And she said it all right from the start
Make no problems, make no debts
But I love that lady, I got to confess

Chorus: ...
