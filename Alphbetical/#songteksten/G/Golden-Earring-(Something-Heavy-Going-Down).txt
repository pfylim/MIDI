GOLDEN EARRING - SOMETHING HEAVY GOING DOWN

On the streets that go by number
Still can't figure out how to get home
There is no life lines only dead lines
Sure picked a fine time to be born
First you taste it then you're wasted
By the time you're almost 16 years old
Everything used to be so simple
Like the beating of a heart
Dedicated to my little darling
Right until the day we'd part
There's fist on the door
I can hear it knocking
Gotta check it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt

Refrain:
There's something heavy going down
And there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
Something heavy going down

On a midnight operation when the searchlights
Make your skin crawl
My reaction to the action is
I don't wanna be doing this at all
Breaking  rules that are made in schools
That teach you how to be successful
Used to be so simple
Like the beating of a heart
Dedicated to my little darling
Right until the day we'd part
There's fist on the door
I can hear it knocking
Gotta check it out
Beyond a shadow of a doubt

Refrain: ...

And there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down something heavy going down
There's more to it than a rocket and a bomb
There's something going down something heavy going down
And there's more to it than a pistol and a gun
There's something going down down down down yeah
Something going down
