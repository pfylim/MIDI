Title  : MY TURN TO LOVE YOU
Artist : EDDY GRANT

(Words & music: Eddy Grant)

Chorus:
My turn to love you
And I got to do, got to do
Do it baby, do it child
My turn to love you
And I got to do, got to do
Do it baby, do it child

If I didn't love, would I tell you 'bout the future
If I didn't love you, would I even seem to care
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
We can talk about it some time
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
This is not the place or time

Chorus: ...

When you said you love me
Did I even seem to flinch
Took all that you gave me
And you didn't feel the pinch
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Don't tell me 'bout your boyfriend
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
Oh, turn out the light
He can love you till the end

Chorus: ...
