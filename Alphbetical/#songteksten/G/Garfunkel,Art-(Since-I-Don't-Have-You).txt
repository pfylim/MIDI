I don't have plans and schemes
and I don't have anything
since I don't have you.

I don't have fond desires
and I don't have happy hours
I don't have anything
since I don't have you.

I don't have happiness - and I guess
I never will ever again
when you walked out on me
in walked the misery
and he's been here since then.

I don't have to share
and I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
since I don't have you.

I don't have to share
and I don't have one who cares
I don't have anything
since I don't have you
you, you, you, you, you...
