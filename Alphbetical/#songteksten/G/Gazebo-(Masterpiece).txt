What a wonderful day
everything is o.k.
not a problem in mind
leaving worries behind
except for that little doubt you have
concerning your dress tonight
but then you take a bottle of french wine
and you say you don't live twice - you cast the dice -

Masterpiece, you should have seen it
that rainbow in the moonglow
masterpiece, you've got to live it
that new dawn tomorrow.

Drivin' down through Beverley Hills
you feel the breeze of the past in your lungs.

What an elegant place
you walk with elephant grace
all Sunset Boulevard
has been waiting the star
the all gather to celebrate
(He): Happy birthday my honey dear !
What a joy to see your old mates
in this Hollywood atmosphere - with us at last -

Masterpiece, you should have seen it
that rainbow in the moonglow
masterpiece, you've got to live it
that new dawn tomorrow.
Masterpiece, you never act it
but live is a movie
masterpiece, you've got to try it
we're sure you'd be moving.

You've had a tango to much
you say you'll keep in touch
back home in your Rolls-Royce
you smile and think of the boys
all of a sudden your sight obscures
and your memories drift the air
and you finally feel secure
you're another star up - star up there -
