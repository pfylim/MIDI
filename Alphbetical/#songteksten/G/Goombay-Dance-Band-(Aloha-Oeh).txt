Singer : GOOMBAY DANCE BAND
Title  : ALOHA-OEH (UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN)

(Words & music: O. Bendt/J.Petersen/E.Clinton)

I have to leave my heart
And go away
To a land across the farest sea
But my thought is
Will always be by you
If I should never come
Don't cry in vane

Chorus:
Aloha-oe
Aloha-oe
Be back again some day
And then I'll stay
You warm embrace
Will leave a trace
(until we meet again)

Through seven seas and hills
I'm outward bound
But one thing I know
My heart is found
When the wind blows
Tahiti girl, beware
It could be that I'm homeward bound

Chorus: ...
