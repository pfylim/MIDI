Hey operator get me Valery on the phone
Hey operator I want Valery on the phone
Right now
Mister navigator, I want location exact
Of where my Valery's at

I see dials turnin'
I see a lighthouse burning
Nothin' happenin' yet
Nothin' happenin' so far

Revelator do you thing for me
Divine oracle do your thing for me and my gal
I been around the world

Yeah, hey operator what's that you said to me
Hey operator you can't say that to me
I won't take no for an answer
Valery is gonna say yes to me

Sweet, sweet Valery,
She's gonna say yes to me
