Title  : I'M ON FIRE

If you want a sweet sweet love tonight
Call me and I'll make you feel alright
When you're out and running around
Playing games all over town
Turn around, come on down
I'll be there, yeah yeah

If you want some sweet sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new you'll see
I can make your fire burn
With the touch of just one kiss
Turn you on all night long
You'll be gone gone gone

Honey now I'm on my way I'm on fire
Yes, I am I'm on fire
Honey now I'm on my way I'm on fire
I'm on fire baby
Honey now I'm on my way I'm on fire
Yes, I am, my baby
Honey now I'm on my way I'm on fire
I'm on fire baby

If you want some sweet sweet love from me
Take a chance with someone new you'll see
I can make your fire burn
With the touch of just one kiss
Turn you on all night long
You'll be gone gone gone
