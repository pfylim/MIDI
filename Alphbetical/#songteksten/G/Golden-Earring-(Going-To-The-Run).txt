Title  : Going To The Run
Singer : Golden Earring


I could bet on new-years eve
He'd call me up at night
From the other side of the world
Ed was always there alright
Ed's got the looks of a moviestar
Ed's got the smile of a prince
He rides a bike instead of a car
I wanna be his friend
Dancin' in the livingroom with the ladies so nice
Like a child with a  wisdomtooth
He's just a friend of mine
Ed's got the rings and the colours
Ed's got the wind in his hair
He goes riding with the brothers
He's got a fist in the air
Going to the run, run Angel
And heaven and hell came together that night
Only for you this time
Going to the run, forever Angel
One summer at the festival
Holdin' on real tight
On the back of a Harley
He took me for a ride in the sky
And his wings started to shine so bright
Like a fire into the night
Going to the run, run Angel
