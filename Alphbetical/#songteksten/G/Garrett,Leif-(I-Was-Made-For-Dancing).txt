Singer : LEIF GARRETT 
Title  : I WAS MADE FOR DANCIN'

(Words & music: Michael Lloyd)

You got me rolling like a wheel on a roll
Turning 'round and 'round
Nowhere to go

I got to find out if you're feeling it too
It's hard to tell
So here's what I'll do

And every time I want more
I'll take you out on the floor

Chorus:
I was made for dancing
Oh oh oh what I long
I was made for dancing
Oh oh oh what I long

It's easy dancin', movin' body and you
You're such a crazy love
You tear me in two

I spent my time moving to turns and a fraze
You're such a crazy love
You can see it in my face

And every time I want more
I take you out on the floor

Chorus: ...4x...
