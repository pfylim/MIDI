GODLEY & CREME - CRY

You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is darling
It's the sound of my tears falling or is it the rain
You don't know
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie, you make me want to cry
You make me want to cry
Cry
You make me want to cry

You don't know how to ease my pain, you don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
Don't you hear any voices crying
That's the sound of our love dying
Here comes the rain
You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie, you don't even know
how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry
You don't know
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me want to cry
Cry
Cry
Cry
