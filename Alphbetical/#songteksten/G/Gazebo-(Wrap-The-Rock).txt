One two three four o.k.
this is a little funny chinese game
all you need is a piece of paper,
a pair of scissors
and a rock
wrap the rock;

Cut the paper
crush the scissors
wrap the rock
wrap the rock
cut the paper
cut the paper
wrap the rock
wrap the rock
crush the scissors
crush the scissors
wrap the rock
wrap the rock

O.k. now everybody
cut the paper with the scissors
take the stone and crush the scissors
and now,
take what's left of your piece of paper
and wrap the rock
wrap the rock
scissors
paper
rock
crush the scissors
one two three four
wrap the rock.
