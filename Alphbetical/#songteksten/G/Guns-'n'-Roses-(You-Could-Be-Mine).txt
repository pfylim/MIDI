I'm a cold heartbreaker
fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two
an I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before ya wake
it's nuthin new ta you
'cause I think we've seen that movie too

'Cause you could be mine
but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin'
and your cocaine tongue
you get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine

Now holidays come and then they go
it's nothin new today
collect another memory
when I come home late at night
don't ask me where I've been
just count your stars I'm home again

'Cause you could be mine
but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin'
and your cocaine tongue
you get nuthin' done
I said you could be mine

You've gone sketchin too many times
why don't ya give it a rest
why 
must you find
another reason to cry

While you're breakin' down my back n'
I been rackin' out my brain
it don't matter how we make it
'cause it always ends the same
you can push it for more mileage
but your flaps r' wearin' thin
and I could sleep on it til mornin'
but this nightmare never ends
don't forget to call my lawyers
with ridiculous demands
an you can take the pity so far
but it's more than I can stand
'cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
tell me how long has it been
'cause 5 years is forever
an you haven't grown up yet

You could be mine

but you're way out of line
with your bitch slap rappin' 
and your cocaine tongue
you get nuthin' done
I said you could be
you should be
you could be mine
