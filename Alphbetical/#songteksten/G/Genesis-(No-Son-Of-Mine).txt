The key to my survival
was never in much doubt
the question was how I could keep sane
trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
peace of mind was hard to find
and I needed a place where I could hide
somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
'til it started happening all the time
soon I was living with the fear everyday
of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
crying of my mother
and I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
last they'd see of me
and I never went home again

They say time is healer
and now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
he looked me straight in the eyes

he said :

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
and you're no son, no son of mine

Oh his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
and as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
but where should I go
and what should I do
you're no son, 
no son of mine
but I came here 
for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about everyday
what would I do
if we passed on the street
would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
soon I'd have to face the facts
we'd have to sit down and talk it over
and that would mean going back

They say time is healer
and now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
he looked me straight in the eyes

he said :

You're no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
