Singer : GARY GLITTER 
Title  : I LOVE YOU LOVE ME LOVE

We're still together
After all that we've been through
They tried to tell you
I was not the boy for you
They didn't like my hair
The clothes I love to wear
They didn't realize
That I was strong enough for two

Refrain:
I love you love, you love me too love
I love you love me love
I love you love me only true love
I love you love me love

So here we are alone
We made it on our own
And though they tried they can't deny
The way I really showed

Refrain: ...

The things they said about
The two of us were lies
I know they couldn't see
The love-lights in your eyes
They said I wouldn't dare
To show how much I care
They didn't know
That we were just two angels in disguise

Refrain: ...
