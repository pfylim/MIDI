I can't see you mama,
but I can hardly wait.
Oh to touch and to feel you mama.
Oh I just can't keep away.
In the heat and the steam of the city,
oh, it's got me running and I just can't break.
So say you'll help me mama, 
'cause it's getting so hard.
Oh.
Now I can't keep you mama,
but I know you're always there.
You listen; you teach me mama, 
and I know inside you care.

So get down, down here beside me.
Oh you ain't going nowhere.
No I won't hurt you mama, 
but it's getting so hard.
Oh.
Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Oh !
Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Oh !

Can't you see me here mama ,
mama, mama, mama ?
Please.
Can't you feel my heart ?
Oh can't you feel my heart ?
Can't you feel my heart ?
Oh.
Now listen to me mama, mama, mama.
You're taking away my last chance.
Don't take it away.
Can't you feel my heart ?

Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Ha ! Ha !  Ha !
Oh !

It's hot, too hot for me mama,
but I can hardly wait.
My eyes, they're burning mama,
and I can feel my body shake.
Don't stop don't stop me mama.
Oh, oh make the pain,
make it go away. 
No I won't hurt you mama,
but it's getting so hard.
Oh.
Now I can see you mama, 
but I know you're always there.
You taunt, you tease me mama,
but I never never never can keep away.
It's the heat and the steam
of the city.
Oh, oh got me running 
and I just can't break.
So stay, don't leave me mama,
'cause it's getting so hard.
