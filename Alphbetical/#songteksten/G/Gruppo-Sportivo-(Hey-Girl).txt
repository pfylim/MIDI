Title  : HEY GIRL

(Words & music: Van Defruits)

She said sorry but it's over
You can't stay with me no more
I've got another crazy lover
Pack your things and shut the door

I said hey girl all I need is one more time
I said Suzy baby would you be so kind

She said your nose is running honey
I said sorry but it's not
She said I've got another lover
Nice to have met you thanks a lot

I said hey girl all I need is one more time
I said Suzy baby would you be so kind

Turn me on I'm feeling down
You're my only friend around
I want someone like you
You gotta give me one more chance
I've got a rocket in my pants
I want someone like you

I said hey girl all I need is one more time
I said Suzy baby would you be so kind
