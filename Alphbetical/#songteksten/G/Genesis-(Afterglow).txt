Like the dust that settles all around me
I must find a new home.
The way and holes that used to give me shelter
are all as one to me now.
But I, I would serch ev'rywhere just to hear your call.
And walk upon stranger roads than
this one in a world I used to know before.

I miss you more than the sun reflecting off my pillow
bringing the warmth of new life.
And the sounds that echoed all around me
I caught a glimpse of in the night.
But now, now I've lost ev'rything.
I give to you my soul.

The meaning of all that I believed before 
escapes me in this world of none, nothing, no one.
And I would search ev'rywhere just to hear your call.
And walk upon stranger roads than
this one in a world I used to know before.
For now I've lost ev'rything, I give to you my soul.

The meaning of all that I believed before 
escapes me in this world of none.
I miss you more.
