Title  : DESIRE

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Maurice Gibb/Robin Gibb)

We may be big, or small, or black and white eternally
And black and white is you and me, in a special light
We may be young, or old, or in between, but this much I know
Together we can learn to grow
In a world that's ever turning, it's back on you
If you give it all away, make it mine, mine, mine, mine

Chorus:
You are desire, everything you need I give you right or wrong
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on
And when I get to you, my desire is glowing in your light

These are the golden years, we get to live, we lead the way
Tomorrow we can start today, in a special light
Love could be good, or bad, or in between, but this much I learn
Baby, you and I can learn
In a world that's rearranging, it's reallity
If you give it all away, make it mine, mine, mine, mine

Chorus: ...

And it's nice to light the fire when it's cold outside
If you give it all away, make it mine, mine, mine, mine

Chorus: ...
