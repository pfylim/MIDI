DEBBIE GIBSON - ONLY IN MY DREAMS

Ah, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha
Ah, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha

Every time I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realize, how much I miss you
And I realize, how it feels to be free
Now I feel I'm up to no good (na, na, na)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good (baby)
Now I can't remember when

Now only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

Couldn't see how much I've missed you (now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant (a-ha)
Now I see my world comes tumbling down (my world)
Now I see the road it bent

If I only once could hold you (na, na, naaaaa)
And remember how it used to be (a-haaaa)
If only I could scold you
I forget how it feels to be free

Now only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No, no-no, no, now only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

(sax solo)
Oho, oohoo, pab, pab

Ah, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha
Ah, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha

Now only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No, no, no, now only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams
