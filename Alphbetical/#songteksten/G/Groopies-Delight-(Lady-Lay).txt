Title  : ALLEY-OOP

Oop oop oop oop oop
Alley oop oop oop oop oop

There's a man in the funny papers we all know
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
He lived way back a long time ago
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
He don't eat nothing but a bearcat stew
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
Well this cat's name is Alley oop
Alley oop oop oop oop oop

He's got a chauffeur that's a genuine dinosaur
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
And he can knuckle your head before you count to four
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
He's got a big ugly club and a head full of hair
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
Like great big lions and grizzly bears
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
Alley oop, he's the toughest man that is alive
Alley oop, wearing clothes from wild cats hide
Alley oop, he's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that cave man go

He rides through the jungle tearing limbs of trees
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
Knocking great big monsters dead on their knees
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
The cats don't bug him 'cause they know better
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
'Cause he's a mean motor scooter and a bad go getter
Alley oop oop oop oop oop
Alley oop, he's the toughest man that is alive
Alley oop, wearing clothes from wild cats hide
Alley oop, he's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that cave man go
