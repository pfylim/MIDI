Singer : GUESS WHO 
Title  : DANCIN' FOOL

It was on a saturday night without
A whole lot of shakin'
Ooh my ooh my I was bored
I had my best duds on
It was a chance worth takin'

Some how I was still ignored
Been too long since I've been
Shy and lonely
Ooh but that's okay
Need some gal to be my one and only

I got a wink and a smile from a flashy filly
Ooh my ooh she looked grand
She said I like your style
Now don't go acting silly
Ooh my ooh, she grabbed my hand
Never thought that I could shake
And groove it
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Dug my feet 'cause they really move it
She got the message across
And me and her got kissin'
Ooh my ooh havin' fun
I know that this is the thing that
I've been really missin'
One more dance has just begun
No more time for feelin' shy and lonely
Now I'm a dancin' fool
Found some gal to be my one and only
Ooh, I'm a dancin' fool
I'm a dancin' fool, I'm a dancer
