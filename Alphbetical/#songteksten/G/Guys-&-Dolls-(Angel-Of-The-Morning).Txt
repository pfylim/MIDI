Title  : ANGEL OF THE MORNING

(Words & music: Chip Taylor)

There'll be no strings to bind your hands
Not if my live can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Chorus:
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Then slowly turn away from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Chorus: ...

I won't beg you to stay with me
Through the tears of the day of the years

Chorus: ...

Just call me angel of the morning, angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
