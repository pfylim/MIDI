Oh, oh, Andy
Since the day I saw you, Andy
How I fell for you, my Andy
I'm in love, I'm in love
But for love it takes two
Andy, where did our love go, Andy
Don't you know what I know, Andy
I'm in love, I'm in love
But for love it takes two

Chorus:
It's a drag, it's a drag, it's a ha-ha-ha
Feel so bad now we've come to an end
It's a drag, it's a drag, it's a ha-ha-ha
And it was alright, when you held me tight
Now ain't it good to know that you got a friend

Sweet, Andy
Now I'm broken hearted, Andy
Since the day it started, Andy
I'm in love, I'm in love
But for love it takes two
Andy, where did our love go, Andy
Don't you know what I know, Andy
I'm in love, I'm in love
But for love it takes two

Chorus: ...

You're the one to change all seasons
Left me wondering what you do
My heart beats strong, you gave me reasons
But it's not very likely
That I'll never find you
Looking for the things that I do
(Things that I do)

Chorus: ...
