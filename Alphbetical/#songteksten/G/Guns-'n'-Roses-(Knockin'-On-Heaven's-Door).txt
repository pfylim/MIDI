Mama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
it's geting dark to dark to see
feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Kn kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door

Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
that cold black cloud is comin' down
feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Kn kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door
kn knockin' on heaven's door

You just better start sniffin' your own
rank subjugation Jack cause it's just you
against your tattered libido, tha bank and
tha mortitian, forever man and it wouldn't 
be luck if you could get out of live alive

Kn kn knockin' on heaven's door. (2x)
