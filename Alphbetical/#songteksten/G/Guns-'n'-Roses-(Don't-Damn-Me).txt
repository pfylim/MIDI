Don't damn me 
when I speak a piece of my mind
'cause silence isn't golden
when I'm holding  it inside
'cause I've been where I have been
an I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'cause it's all a part of me

Be it a song or a casual conversation
to hold my tongue speaks
of quiet reservations
your words once heard
they can place you in a faction
my words may disturb
but at least there's a reaction

Sometimes I wanna kill
sometimes I wanna die
sometimes I wanna destroy
sometimes I wanna cry
sometimes I could get even
sometimes I could give up
sometimes I could give
sometimes I never give a fuck

It's only for a while
I hope you understand
I never wanted this to happen
didn't want to be a man
so I hid inside my world
I took what i could find
I cried when I was lonely
I fell down when I was blind

But don't damn me when I speak
a piece of my mind
'cause silence isn't golden
when I'm holding it inside
'cause I've been where I have been
an I've seen what I have seen
I put the pen to the paper
'cause it's all a part of me

How can I ever satisfy you
an how can I ever make you see
that deep inside we're all somebody
an it don't matter who you wanna be
but now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend
for this man can say it happened
'cause this child has been condemned
so I stepped into your world
I kicked you in the mind
an I'm the only witness
to the nature of my crime

But look at what we've done
to the innocent and young
whoa listen to who's talking
'cause we're not the only ones
the trash collected by the eyes
and dumped into the brain
said it tears into our conscious thoughts
you tell me who's to blame

I know you don't wanna hear my crying
an I know you don't wanna hear my deny
that your satisfaction lies in your illusions
but your delisions are yours an not mine
we take for granted we know the whole story
we judge a book by it's cover
and read what we want
between selected lines

Don't hail me
and don't idolize the ink
or I've failed in my attentions
can you find the missing link
your only validation is in living your own life
vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
so I send this song to the offended
as so many others do intending just to please
if I damned your point of view
could you turn the other cheek

Don't damn me 
when I speak a piece of my mind
'cause silence isn't golden
when I'm holding  it inside
I've been where I have been
an I've seen what I have seen
put the pen to the paper
'cause it's all a part of me
don't damn me
I said don't damn me
I said don't damn me
don't damn me.
