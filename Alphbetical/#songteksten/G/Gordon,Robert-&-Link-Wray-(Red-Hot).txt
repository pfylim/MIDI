Title  : RED HOT

(Words & music: Emerson)

Chorus:
My gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squad
My gal is red hot
Your gal ain't doodly squad
Well, she ain't got money
But man she's really got a lot

Well I got a girl
Six feet four
Sleeps in the kitchen
With her feet out the door but

Chorus: ...

Well she walks all night
Talks all day
She's the kind of woman
That's gotta have her way but

Chorus: ...

Well she's the kind of woman
Who's lounchin' 'round
Spreadin' my business
All over town, but

Chorus: ...

Well she's a one man's woman
That's what I like
Gotta wishy washy woman
Change her mind every night, but

Chorus: ...
