2. ALICE, WHO THE X IS ALICE - GOMPIE

Sally called when she got the word
She said I suppose
You've heard about Alice
Well I rushed to the window
well I looked outside
I could hardly believe my eyes
As a big limousine rolled up into Alice's drive

Don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
'Cos for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice
(Alice, who the fuck is Alice?)

24 years, just waiting for the chance
To tell her how I feel
And maybe get a second chance
Now I got to get used
To not living next door to Alice
(Alice, who the fuck is Alice?)

We grew up together
Two kids in the park
we carved our initials
Deep in the bark
He and Alice
Now she walks through the door
With her head held high
Just for a moment, I caught her eye
A big limousine pulled slowly
Out of Alice's drive

Chorus.....

Sally called back and asked
How I felt and she said
Hey I know how to help
Get over Alice
She said, now Alice is gone
But I'm still here
You know I've been waiting
For 24 years and the big limousine disappeared

Chorus.....

Now I'll never get used
To not living next door to Alice
