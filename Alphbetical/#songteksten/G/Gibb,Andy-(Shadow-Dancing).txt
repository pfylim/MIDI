Title  : SHADOW DANCING

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb/Andy Gibb)

You got me lookin' at that heaven in your eyes
I was chasing your direction
I was telling you no lies
And I was loving you when the words said
Baby I lost my head
And in a world of people there's only you and I
There ain't nothing come between us in the end
Oh how can I hold you when you ain't even mine
Only you can see me through, I leave it up to you

Chorus:
Do it right taking me through the night
Shadow dancing
Baby you do it right
Give me more drive me across the floor
Shadow dancing
All the end, loving more
Ahh

All that I need is just one moment in your arms
I was chasing your affection I was doing you no harm
And I was loving you make it shine (make it rain)
Baby I know my way
I need the sweet sensation of living in your love
I can't breathe when you're away it pulls me down
Oh you are the question and the answer and

Chorus: ...2x...
