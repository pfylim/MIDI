Title  : SUN OF JAMAICA

(Words & music: Stein/Jass)

Long time ago, when I was a young boy
I saw that movie, Mutiny on the Bounty
Starring my idol, Marlon Brando
And I felt a yearning for that great adventure
So many nights I woke up out of a dream
A dream of blue seas, white sands
Paradise birds, butterflies, and beautiful warm-hearted girls

Chorus:
Sun of Jamaica, the dreams of malaika
Your love is my sweet memory
Sun of Jamaica, blue lady malaika
Someday I'll return, wait and see
Walk in the sand and I'm happy with you
We shall be loving and true
Oh, I sure love malaika
With all of my heart
I will always be faithful and true, yeah true

But now as I grew older
The burning desire became so strong
That I bought a ticket to fly home
And then I found you
And we found eternal love right from the beginning
The stars falling down from the lagoon of gold
The palms swaying under the moon
We were swimming out into the crystal sea
In that fatefull night I thought to myself
I'll do everything I can, save every dime
And one day I'll return
And then I'll stay forever, forever

Chorus: ...
