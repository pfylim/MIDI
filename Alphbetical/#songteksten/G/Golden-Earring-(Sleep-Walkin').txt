Singer : GOLDEN EARRING 
Title  : SLEEP WALKIN'

Last night's blind date
Hit me like a handgranate
Blew holes in my soul
I'm on a love crusade
Wore my loves like a pair of gloves
But this time I'm going straight

'Cause I never felt this strange
I'm supposed to be skilled at the game
So once again it goes to show
You'll fall into the trap of love
Before you know

Sleepwalkin', don't panic
We're on the Titanic
Don't you try to call my bluff
Both eyes shut travels hard enough
Sleepwalkin', don't panic
We're on the Titanic
Across the bridges 'round the poop
A fire escape, won't hesitate

She's floating there
A living jewel
A gem that makes me lose my cool
It's no surprise I'm paralysed
This vision has got me hypnotized
Remember your princely duty
Rescue that sleepin' beauty
