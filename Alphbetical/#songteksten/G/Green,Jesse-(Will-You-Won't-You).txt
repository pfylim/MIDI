Singer : JESSE GREEN 
Title  : WILL YOU, WON'T YOU

(Words & music: Ken Gibson)

How about it I can't do without you
I must have your love
How about it I say don't you doubt it
I must have your love
You're making up to me and then
Oh why'd you stop me once again

Refrain:
Will you love me
Won't you love me
Oh baby how can it be
That you're leading me on and
You're letting me down
Oh will you, won't you
Will you, won't you

Make your mind up
All my feelings wind up for I
Need your love
Make your mind up
'Cause I've got you lined up
I must have your love
Can't live without it anymore
Why keep me waiting
What's the score

Refrain: ...
