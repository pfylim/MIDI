Title  : NEVER CAN SAY GOODBYE

Never can say goodbye no no no no
I never can say goodbye

Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me where-ever I go
Tho' I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to save you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so that I
Never can say goodbye no no no no
I never can say goodbye

Ev'ry time I think I've had enough
And start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
Piercing me right to the core
It says turn around you fool
You know you love him more and more
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, boy
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
no no no no no no
I never can say goodbye, boy
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
no no no no no no
Never can say goodbye no no no no
I never can say goodbye

I keep thinking that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's a same unhappy feelin'
There's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old dizzy hang up
Can't do with you or without
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
no no no no
I never can say goodbye
