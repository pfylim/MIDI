BORIS GARDNER - I WANT TO WAKE UP WITH YOU

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna be there when you open your eyes
I want you to be the first thing that I see
I wanna wake up with you

I wanna lay by your side, baby
I wanna feel every beat of your heart
And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight
I wanna wake up with you

REFRAIN:
All the love inside me has been sleeping
Waiting till the right one came along
You can share the love that I've been keeping (baby)
You can put the music to my song

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna reach out and know that you're there
I want you to be the first thing that I see
I wanna wake up with you

too doo too too ..

And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight
I wanna wake up with you

REFRAIN: ...

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna reach out and know that you're there
I want you to be the first thing that I see
I wanna wake up with you

I wanna lay by your side, baby
I wanna feel every beat of your heart
And throughout the night I wanna hold you tight
I wanna wake up with you

too doo too too ..

I want you to be the first thing that I see
I wanna wake up with you

REFRAIN: ...

I wanna wake up with you
I wanna reach out and know that you're there
