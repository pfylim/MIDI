I tried so hard just to get through to you
but your head's so far
from the realness of truth
was it just a come on in the dark
wasn't meant to last long
I think you've worn your welcome honey

I'll just see you along as I sing you this song

Time can pass slowly, things always change
your days been numbered
and I've read your last page
you was just a temporary lover
honey you ain't the first
lots of others came before you woman
said but you been the worst
sa'you been the worst

So goodbye to you girl
so long, farewell
I can't hear you cryin'
your jivin's been hell
so look for me walkin' 
down your street at night
I'll be in with another
deep down inside

Deep down inside.
