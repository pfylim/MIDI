Singer : GUYS & DOLLS 
Title  : THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF LOVING

Refrain:
There's a whole lot of loving
Going on in my heart
It's a feeling I'm feeling through and through
There's a whole lot of missing
Ev'rytime we're apart
There's a whole lot of loving just for you

Bigger than the Mississippi river near the ocean
Wider than the desert and the Utah sky
Stronger than the dynamos of Hooverdam in motion
You supply the reason why

Refrain: ...

Warmer than the sun that warms the corners of Kentucky
Taller than the California redwood tree
Richer than a forty niner miner striking lucky
He was never rich as me

Like a highway that goes on and on
And never bend
Like a fire that glows on and on
And it never ends

Refrain: ...

There's a whole lot of loving just for you
