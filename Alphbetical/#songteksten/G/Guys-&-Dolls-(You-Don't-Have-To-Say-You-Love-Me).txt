Singer : GUYS AND DOLLS 
Title  : YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY YOU LOVE ME

(Words & music: V. Pallavincini/P. Donaggio)

When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you
And now you're gone away

Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I had to follow you
And beg you to come home

Chorus:
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't helpin' love you
But believe me
I'll never tie you down

Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

Chorus: ...
