Sick of this life
not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with
whom this feelings I share

Nobody understands, quite why we're here
we're searchin' for answers
that never appear

But maybe if I looked real hard I'd
I'd see your tryin' too
to understand this life
that we're all going through

(then when she said she was gonna like
wreck my car.....I didn't know what to do)

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
an I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's
worth a tad more
it may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
never change

I met an old cowboy
I saw the look in his eyes
somethin' tells me he's been here before
'cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child
when the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son
that brought back the devil in me

But sometimes I feel like 
I'm beatin' a dead horse
an I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's 
worth a tad more
it may sound funny but you'd think by now

I'd be smilin'
I guess some things never change
never change

I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
still wet behind the ears
I been around this track a couple o'times
but now the dust is startin' to clear
oh yeah !

Sometimes I feel like I'm beatin' a dead horse
an I don't know why you'd be bringin' me down
I'd like to think that our love's
worth a tad more
it may sound funny but you'd think by now
I'd be smilin'
oh yeah, I'd be smilin'
no way, I'd be smilin'
ooh smilin'

Sick of this life
not that you'd care
I'm not the only one
with whom these feelings I share.
e's a heaven above you baby
and don't you cry tonight
