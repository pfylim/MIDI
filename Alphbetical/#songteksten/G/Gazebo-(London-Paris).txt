Eight p.m. I'm lookin' forward
to going across the english channel
lookin' forward to leaving all my doubts behind
and I feel so fine
I don't know why but I feel alright
I see live growing in my heart.

London Paris London Paris
London Paris London Paris.

Ten p.m. I'm on the boat deck
talking with a girl about life
(He) :  do you like that Toulouse Lautrec graffitti ?
(She):  yes I do indeed, I don't know why
but I like the scene
with all it's echoes...Revoluchansons
(He) :  with all it's restaurants.

London Paris London Paris
London Paris London Paris.
