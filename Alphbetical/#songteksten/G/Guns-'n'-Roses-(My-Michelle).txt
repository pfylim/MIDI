Your daddy works in porno
now that mommy'sw not around
she used to love her heroin
but now she's underground
so you stay out late at night
and you do your coke for free
drivin' your friends crazy
with your life's insanity

Well, well, well you just can't tell
well, well, well my Michelle

Sowin' all your wild oats
in another's luxuries
Yesterday was Tuesday
maybe Thursday you can sleep
but school starts much too early
and this hotel wasn't free
so party till your connection calls
honey I'll return the key

Chorus:
Well, well, well you just can't tell
well, well, well my Michelle
well, well, well you never can tell
well, well, well my Michelle

Evryone needs love
you know that it's true
someday you you'll find someone
that'll fall in love with you
but oh the time it takes
when you're all alone
someday you'll find someone
that you can call your own
but till then ya better...

Now you're clean
and so discreet
I won't say a word
but most of all this song is true
case you haven't heard
so c'mon and stop your cryin'
'cause we both know money burns
honey don't stop tryin
an you'll get what you deserve

Chorus:
Well, well, well you just can't tell
well, well, well my Michelle
well, well, well you never can tell
well, well, well my Michelle.
