Title  : MAYBE A LIFETIME

Refrain:
May be a lifetime
A lifetime love and sunshine
Even when we're ninetynine
A lifetime full of love

Heaven knows
Where we will go
(onleesbaar......
.............)as I know
(.........)in love with me
And that's all that counts for me

On the other hand
Do you understand
Everlasting love
Will also end
So don't ask me
How long it will be

Refrain: ...

It's a funny thing
We are wondering
How long will it last
Without doing our best
Let's try to see
It depends on you and me

Refrain: ...

Heaven knows
How love can grow
As long as we say
I love you so
Let's try to see
It depend on you and me
