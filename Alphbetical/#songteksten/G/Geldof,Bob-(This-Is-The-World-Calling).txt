BOB GELDOF - THIS IS THE WORLD CALLING

(Words & music: Bob Geldof)

I hear a heart beat
It's ringing out across the universe
It sounds so lost and lonely
It must come from somewhere deep inside of us
And the operator says
All is calm
All is quiet
Close your eyes and sleep tonight

This is the world calling
This is earth
This is the world calling
This is us

I'm on a train now
I'm moving through the yellow fields of rape
There's so much beauty
I wished that I believed enough to pray
Then the operator says
Spinning 'round, you're wrapped in blue
There's no one looks as good as you

This is the world calling
This is us
And it goes on and on

What we going to do because it can't go on
Wrap me in your arms and keep me warm tonight

This is the world calling
God help us
