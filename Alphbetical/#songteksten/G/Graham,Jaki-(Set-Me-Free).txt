JAKI GRAHAM - SET ME FREE

Set me free (woooh)

Flash back hits me
Right between the eyes
The man just came and said to me
I want you by my side

Something so excited
But not without a doubt (a doubt)
He's locked the door and thrown the key
Someone get me out

A:
I know he means no harm to me
But building walls confining me
Can only make me wanna leave
Set me free

REFRAIN:
Set me free (woooh) (8x)

Falling crashing
In and out of love
Doing things that girls do
Then came about

So delightful
All that I could want
But he's locked the door and
Thrown the key
Won't you let me out

A + REFRAIN: ...

Let me go
I said let me go
Set me free

A: ...

Let me go
I said let me go
Set me free

REFRAIN: ...
