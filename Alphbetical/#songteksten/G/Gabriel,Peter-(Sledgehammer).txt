You could have a steam train if you'd just lay down your tracks,
You could have an aeroplane flying if you bring your blue sky back.
All you do is call me, I'll be anything you need.
You could have a big dipper going up and down, all around the bends.
You could have a bumper car bumping, this amusement never ends.
I want to be your sledgehammer, why don't you call my name ?
Oh, let me be your sledgehammer, this will be my testimony.

Show me round your fruitcage, 'cause I will be your honey bee,
Open up your fruitcage where the fruit is as sweet as can be.
I want to be your sledgehammer, why don't you call my name ?
You'd better call the sledgehammer, put your mind at rest.
I'm going to be the sledgehammer, this can be my testimony,
I'm your sledgehammer, let there be no doubt about it.
Sledge - sledge - sledgehammer -

I've kicked the habit - kicked the habit - kicked the habit,
Shed my skin - shed my skin.
This is the new stuff - this is the new stuff,
I go dancing in - we go dancing in.
Oh, won't you show for me - show for me,
I will show for you - show for you,
Show for me - show for me,
I will show for you,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I do mean you, only you.

You've been coming through 
Going to build that power,
Build, build up that power, hey !
I've been feeding the rhythm,
I've been feeding the rhythm -
Going to feel that power,
Build in you -

Come on, come on, help me do,
Come on, come on, help me do -
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you !
I've been feeding the rhythm,
I've been feeding the rhythm -
It's what we're doing,
Doing all day and night.
