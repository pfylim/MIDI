Title  : GENTLEMEN CALLERS NOT ALLOWED

(Words & music: Frank Farian/Jay)

I was seventeen when I left my home town
I just didn't want the same people always around
I guess in those days I was the roaming kind
I got me a room in some big city
Eddy and I thought that we had a find
The evening came, and boy, were we in a bind

Chorus:
Gentlemen callers not allowed
Gentlemen callers not allowed
No lovin' and kissin'
No lovin' and kissin'
No lovin' and kissin'

Well, this was a blow for Eddy and me
I had the idea in a city you sure were free
So we had to play the same old game once more
I said to my landlord: That's my brother
He only answered: I've heard this song before
And then he showed my Eddy to the door

Chorus: ...

One night about ten, the landlord walked right in
I come for the rent, he said, giving me one long grin
He walked towards me and his eyes left not a doubt
He wanted much more that I would give him
I said: Don't touch me or I'll shout
I gave him the money and then I threw him out

Chorus: ...

I've got a new room now
So there is no gloom now
