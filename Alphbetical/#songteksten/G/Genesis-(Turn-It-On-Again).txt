All I need is a T.V. show.
that and the radio.
Down on my luck again.
Down on my luck again.
I can show you, I can show you
some of the people in my life.

I can show you, I can show you
some of the people in my life.

It's driving me mad.
Just another way of passing the day.
I, I, get so lonely when she's not there.
I, I, I, I.
You're just another face
that I know from a T.V. show.
I have known you for so very long.
I feel you like a friend.
Can't you do anything for me ?
Can I touch you for a while ?
Can I meet you on another day,
and we will fly away ?

I can show you, I can show you
some of the people in my life.
I can show you, I can show you
some of the people in my life.

It's driving me mad.
It's just another way of passing the day.
I, I, get so lonely when she's not there.
I, I, I, I.

Turn it on.
Turn it on, turn it on again.
Turn it on.
Turn it on, turn it on again.
Turn it on.
Turn it on, turn it on again.
Turn it on.
Turn it on, turn it on again.
