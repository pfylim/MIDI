Oh bring back my bonnie to me

Bring back bring back
Bring back my bonnie to me, to me
Bring back bring back
Oh bring back my bonnie to me

ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK

One, two, three o' clock
Four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock
Eight o'clock rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock
Twelve, o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around
The clock tonight

Put your glad rags on and join me, Hon
We'll have some fun when the clocks strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til the broadway light
We're gonna rock, gonna rock
Around the clock tonight

When the clock strikes two and three and four
If the band slows down we'll yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til the broadway light
We're gonna rock, gonna rock
Around the clock tonight

When the chimes ring five and six and seven
We'll be rockin' up in seventh heav'n
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til the broadway light
We're gonna rock, gonna rock
Around the clock tonight

When it's eight, nine, ten, eleven too
I'll be goin' strong and so will you
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til the broadway light
We're gonna rock, gonna rock
Around the clock tonight

When the clock strikes twelve we'll cool off then
Start a rockin' 'round the clock again
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til the broadway light
We're gonna rock, gonna rock
Around the clock tonight
