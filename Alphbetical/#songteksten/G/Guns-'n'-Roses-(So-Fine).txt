How could she look so fine
how could it be she might be mine
how could she be so cool
I've been taken for a fool so many times
it's a story of a man
who works as hard as he can
just to be a man who stands on his own
but the book always burns
as the story takes it's turn
an leaves a broken man
how could she be so cool
how could she be so fine
I owe a favour to a friend
my friends they always come through for me
yeah
it's a story of a man
who works as hard as he can
just to be a man who stands on his own
but the book always burns
as the story takes it's turn
an leaves a broken man
If you could only live my life
you could see the difference you make to me
to me
I'd look right up at night
and all I'd see was darkness
now I see the stars alright
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you
when the lights went down in your house
yeah that made me happy
the sweat I make for you
yeah...I think you know where that comes from

Well I'd look right up at night
and all I'd see was darkness
now I see the stars alright
I wanna reach right up and grab one for you
when the lights went down in your house
yeah that made me happy
the sweat I make for you
yeah...I think you know where that comes from

How could she looks so good (so good)
how could she be so fine
how could she be so cool
how could it be she might be mine.
