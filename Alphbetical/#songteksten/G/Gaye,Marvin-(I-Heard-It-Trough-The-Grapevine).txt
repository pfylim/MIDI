MARVIN GAYE - I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE

Ooh I bet you wondered how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
You know I love you more

It took me by surprise I must say
(Took me by surprise I must say)
When I found out yesterday
(When I found out yesterday)
Don't you know that
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
(I heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby ooh)

I know a man ain't suppose to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside (ooh)
Losing you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me (ooh)
You could have told me yourself
(You could have told me yourself)
That you loved someone else
(That you loved someone else)
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine (ooh)
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey honey yeah
(I heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby ooh)

People say believe half of what you see
Son and not of what you hear
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
(Do you plan to let me go)
For the other guy you love oh
(For the other guy you love)
Don't you know that
I heard it through the grapevine (ooh)
Not much longer would you be mine
Baby I heard it through the grapevine (ooh)
Ooh I'm just about to lose mind
Honey honey yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Honey I know
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
That you let me go
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Said I heard it through the grapevine
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be mine baby)
(Ooh I heard it through the grapevine)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
