DEBBIE GIBSON - FOOLISH BEAT

(Words & music: Debbie Gibson)

Ooh there was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you oh

Refrain:
I could never love again the way I loved you oh
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
I could never love again now that we're apart

Oh when I was sorry
It was too late to turn around (turn around)
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart

Refrain: ...

Oh can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face
Since you went away hey
Break my heart you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone
Ooh ooh ooh d-doo doo doo doo

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apart
