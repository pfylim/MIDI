Title  : I WANNA STAY WITH YOU

Inside, outside, I've been around
And love let me down again
Feel like a weatherman
One day sunny, one day rain
And you ask me if I really care
Don't you know the answer
Rainy day blues, never felt this way

I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life

When I gave my loving to you
It meant little to me
Somehow, somewhere
You changed my point of view
Good times, bad times, happy or sad
Being in love is better that being out
I might have had my doubts
But nothing to write home about

I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
I wanna stay with you
For the rest of my life
