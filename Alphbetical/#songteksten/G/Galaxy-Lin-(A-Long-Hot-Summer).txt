Singer : GALAXY-LIN 
Title  : A LONG HOT SUMMER

The resurrection of a new spring
I hail with delight and it makes my heart sing
Can I believe that as they say
We are near winters very last day
Can I believe we're gonna have a long hot summer
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a long hot summer

I walked along by a church
I stopped and looked up to the sky
Fearful visions came in my mind
Of days with fading light
All over this mighty world
In jungles and desert sands
Men pray to nature's God
For just a helping hand

Can I believe that as they say
We are near winters very last day
Can I believe we're gonna have a long hot summer
It's gonna be, it's gonna be a long hot summer
