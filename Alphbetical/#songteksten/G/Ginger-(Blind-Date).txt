Title  : BLIND DATE
Artist : GINGER

(Words & music: Vic Young)

I:
Blind date, blind date
That's the kinda thing I like best
Blind date, blind date
I better put on my Sunday's best

Well that's a funny situation
My head's going round and round
But there won't be no hesitation
'Cause I got to get myself a girl
Oh, I got to get myself a girl

II:
Blind date, blind date
I only hope that she'll be impressed
Blind date, blind date
I better put on my Sunday's best

Do you think she'll be a lady
I'm not the kind who'll like it for a side
I think I myst be going crazy
I'm sure that it'll be alright
Oh god I hope that it happens tonight

(repeat I)

Well as I suppose to meet her
I hope that she doesn't walk away
'Cause if she does then I'll just have to
Start all over again

I got to find a parking meter
I hate to think I might be late
Oh no, I think I see her
Oh doesn't she look great

Another one in that situation
Written all over her face
But if she'd got the information
I might be back in the race
Oh I got to keep on the pace

(repeat I)
