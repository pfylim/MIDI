I see your sister in her sunday dress
she's out to please
she pouts her best
she's out to take
no need to try
she's ready to make

It's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me baby
it's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me 

Cars are crashin' every night
I drink n'drive everything's in sight
I make the fire
but I miss the firefight
I hit the bull's eye every night

It's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me baby
yeah it's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me 
so easy
but nothin' seems to please me
it all fits so right
when I fade into the night
see me hit you
you fall down

I see you standin' there
you think you're so cool
why don't you just
fuck off

Ya get nothin' for nothin'
if that's what ya do
turn around bitch I got a use for you
beside you ain't got nothin' better to do
and I'm bored

It's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me baby
it's so easy, easy
when everybody's tryin' to please me 
but nothin' seems to please me
it all fits so right
when I fade into the night
so come with me
don't ask me where 'cause I don't know
I'll try to please you
I ain't got no money but it goes to show
it's so easy.
