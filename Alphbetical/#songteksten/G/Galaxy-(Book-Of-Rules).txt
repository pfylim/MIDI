Isn't it strange how princesses and kings dance
clowns ragged capers in saudust rung.

Just like all the people like you and me
we'll be builders for eternity
each is given a bag of tools
a shapeless mask
and a book of rules.

Each must make his life as flowing in
tumbling back on a stepping stone.

Just like all the people like you and me,...

Look when the rain has fallen from the sky
I know the sun will be only missing for a while.

Just like all the people like you and me,...
so excited
'cause we're reunited, hey, hey.
