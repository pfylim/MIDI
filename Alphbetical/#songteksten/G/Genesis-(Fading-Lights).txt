Another time it might have been so different
if only we could do it all again
but now it's just another fading memory
out of focus, though the outline still remains

Far away, away, fading distant lights
leaving us behind, lost in a changing world
and you know that these are the days of our lives 
remember

Like the story that we wish was never ending
we know sometime we must reach the final page
still we carry on just pretending
that there'll always be another day to go

Far away, away, fading distant lights
leaving us behind, lost in a changing world
and you know that these are the days of our lives 
remember

Another chance hello, another goodbye
and so many things we'll never see again
days of life that seemed so unimportant
seem to matter and to count much later on

Far away, away, fading distant lights
leaving us behind, lost in a changing world
and you know that these are the days of our lives 
remember
