
        I can`t dance           Genesis


Hot sun burning down,
burning my feet just walking around.
Hot sun making me sweat,
`gators getting close, hasn`t got me yet.

Refrain

I can`t dance, I can`t talk,
the only thing about me is the way I walk.
I can`t dance, I can`t sing,
I`m just standing here selling everything.


Blue jeans sitting on the beach,
her dog`s talking to me but she`s out of reach.
She`s got a body under that shirt,
but all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt.

Refrain

Cos, I can`t dance...

Bridge 1

Oh, and checking everything is in place,
you never know who`s looking on.


Young punk spilling beer on my shoes,
fat guy`s talking to me trying to steal my blues.
Thick smoke, see her smiling through,
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool.

Refrain

But, I can`t dance...

Bridge 2

And checking everything is in place,
You never know who`s looking on.
A perfect body with a perfect face.

Refrain 

But, I can't dance...
