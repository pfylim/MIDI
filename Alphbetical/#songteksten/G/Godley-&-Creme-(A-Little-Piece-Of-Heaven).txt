GODLEY & CREME - A LITTLE PEACE OF HEAVEN

There's a little piece of heaven
In your eye today
I think I saw it coming
But I really couldn't say
But if it turns into a teardrop
On your cheek today
Will it turn into a river
Before I wipe it away
And when we're apart
I feel so alone
And the mystery man
Who's into our home
Takes a little piece of heaven
A little peace of heaven
A little peace of heaven

There's a little peace of heaven
In the world today
I think I saw it coming
But I really couldn't say
But if it turns into a teardrop
On your cheek today
Will it turn into a river
By the end of the day
Never fought on my own
I had too much pride
Couldn't make it alone
I want you at my side 
To share

A little piece of heaven
A little peace of heaven
A little peace of heaven

When we're a
Little piece of heaven
A little peace of heaven
A little peace of heaven
Will be gone
