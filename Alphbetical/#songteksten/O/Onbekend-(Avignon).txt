AVIGNON


I take you hand in mine  and jopurney back in time
to Avignon
do you recall the day  it seems like yesterday
when love come along  the little street cafe
where we would hide away  just playin' our song
we strolled along lover's lane  ignoring showers of rain
my sweet Madeline

We didn't own a thing  but we had everything
my Madeline
down by the riverside  we'd sit and watch the tide
my Madeline
we used to have such fun  we used to be as one
we're still the same  just picture in your mind
all those carefree times
my sweet Madeline

I found my fist love  in Avignon
my first and last love  in Avignon
let's go backand say hello  to the memories of long ago
together we'll wander  through old Avignon

The cafe still remains  although it's rearranged
our table's still there  the same old atmosphere
is that our song I hear  love everywhere
you look the same today  as you did yesterday
sun in your hair  gonna walk through the town
take a look around  with my sweet Madeline
