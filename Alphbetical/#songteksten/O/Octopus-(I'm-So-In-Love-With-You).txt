Title  : I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU

Refrain:
I'm so in love with you
Ev'rything in me is saying
Speaking your name is like praying
Ev'ry word, ev'ry touch
How I love you oh so much
Stay with me
Together we'll be the rest of our lives

Refrain: ...

You make the sun go on shining
You make my life so worthwhile
I only know you're the one girl for me
And in my dreams I see your smile

Refrain: ...
