Interpret:          ________



I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night
alive as you and me said I:
But Joe, you're ten years dead.
I never died ! Says he.
I never died ! Says he.

The Copper bosses killed you, Joe,
they shot you, Joe, says I.
It takes more than guns to kill a man
says Joe: I didn't die.  (2x)

and standing there as big as life
and smiling with his eyes
says Joe: What they forgot to kill
went on to organize. (2x)

From San Diego up to Maine
in every mine and mill,
where working men defend theit rights,
it's there you'll find Joe Hill. (2x)

I dreamed I saw joe hill last night
alive as you and me.
Says I: But Joe, you're ten Years dead !
Inever died, says he. (2x)
