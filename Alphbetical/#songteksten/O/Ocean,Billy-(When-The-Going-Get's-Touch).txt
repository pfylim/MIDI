When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
When the going gets tough, the tough get ready.

I got something to tell you, I got something to say .
I'm gonna put this dream in motion, never let nothing stand in my way.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
I'm gonna get myself 'cross the river,
That's the price I'm willing to pay.
I'm gonna make you stand and deliver,
And give me love in the old fashioned way.

Darlin' - I'll climb any mountain,
Darlin' - I'll do anything.
Ooh - ooh - can I touch you ? - Can I touch you ?
And do the things that lovers do ?
Ooh - ooh - wanna hold you - wanna hold you -
I gotta get it through to you.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going,
When the going gets rough, the tough get rough -
Hey - hey - hey - hey - hey !

I'm gonna buy me a one-way ticket - nothing's gonna hold me back.
Your love's like a slow train coming - slow train coming -
And I could feel it coming down the track.

Darlin' - I'll climb any mountain.

Darlin' - I'll climb any mountain, darlin' - I'll swim any sea,
Darlin' - I'll reach for the heaven , darlin' - with you lovin' me.
Ooh - ooh - can I touch you ? - Can I touch you ?
And do the things that lovers do ?
Ooh - ooh - wanna hold you - wanna hold you -
I gotta get it through to you.

When the going gets tough - going gets tough -
The going get rough - going gets  rough -
When the going gets tough , going gets tough -
The going get rough - going gets rough -
When the going gets tough , going gets tough -
The going get rough - going gets rough.
