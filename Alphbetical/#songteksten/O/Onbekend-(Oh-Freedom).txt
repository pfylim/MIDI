Oh freedom, oh freedom, 
oh freedom over me !
And before I'd be a slave 
I'll be buried in my grave 
and go home to my Lord and be free.

No more weepin', no more weepin',
no weepin' over me !
And before I'd be a slave 
I'll be buried in my grave 
and go home to my Lord and be free.

No more moanin', no more moanin',
no moanin' over me !
And before I'd be a slave 
I'll be buried in my grave 
and go home to my Lord and be free.

No more segregration, no more segregration,
no segregration over me !
And before I'd be a slave 
I'll be buried in my grave 
and go home to my Lord and be free.

There'll be singin', there'll be singin',
oh singin' over me !
And before I'd be a slave 
I'll be buried in my grave 
and go home to my Lord and be free.
