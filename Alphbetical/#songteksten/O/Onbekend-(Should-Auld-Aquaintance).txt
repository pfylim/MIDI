Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
and never brought to mind ?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
and days of auld lang syne.
For auld lang syne, my dear, 
for auld lang syne, we'll take
a cup of kindness yet 
for auld lang syne.

And there's a hand, my trusty friend, 
and gie's a hand o 'thine,
we'll take a right guid-willi-waught 
for the sake of auld lang syne.
For auld lang sysn, my dear, 
for auld lang syne, we'll take
a cup of kindness yet 
for auld lang sysne.

but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
call me young gun
