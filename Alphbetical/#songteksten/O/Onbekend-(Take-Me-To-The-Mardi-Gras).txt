C'mon take me to the Mardi Gras
where the people sing and play
where the dancing is elite
and there's music in the street
both night and day.

Hurry take me to the Mardi Gras
in the city of my dreams
you can legalize your lows
you can wear your summer clothes
in the New Orleans.

And I will lay my burden down
rest my head upon that shore
and when I wear that starry crown
I won't be wanting anymore.

Take your burdens to the Mardi Gras
let the music wash your soul
you can mingle in the street
you can jingle to the beat
of Jelly Roll.
