Sometimes I feel like a motherless child,
sometimes I feel like a motherless child,
sometimes I feel like a motherless child
a long way from home,
a long way from home.

Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone,
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone,
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost gone
way up in heabenly land.

Sometimes I feel like a feather in the air,
Sometimes I feel like a feather in the air,
Sometimes I feel like a feather in the air
and I spread my wings and I fly.
