We took a place in the  sun
to see what just had become
the warm wind blows constantly
does the answer still blow,
did you find your chateau
in that mediterranean fantasy.

Flying start made the whole world sing
they had no choice
Flying start like a shining pearl, they
sang in one voice.

To where the sun always shines
familiar faces and wines
the warm wind blows constantly
knock on the door but the memory's poor
is there somebody in, now answer me
two dark eyes from the doorway shine
so you lost your dream in a bottle of wine
I knew you had to do it your way, fine
but there's none to carry the cross this time.

On dusty roads and tracks
now it's the time to turn back
the warm wind blows constantly
riding that storm since the day you were born
is there somebody in, now answer me.

Two dark eyes from the doorway shine
so you lost your dream in a bottle of wine
I knew you had to do it your way, fine
but there's none to carry the cross this time.
