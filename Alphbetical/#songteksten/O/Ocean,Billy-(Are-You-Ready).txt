Singer : BILLY OCEAN
Title  : ARE YOU READY?

(Words & music: Ken Gold/Billy Ocean)

Baby, oh baby, we're going out tonight
Meet me, ten thirty and we'll get into flight
What are we gonna do?
We're going to a party
Second on fifty-two
That's where we're gonna start
Saturday rendez-vous
Go out of the city
Gotta get funkey too
We'll tear the place apart

Chorus:
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, of baby
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, are you ready to go?
Are you ready, let's go

Baby, oh baby, I'm feeling mighty hot
Touch me, I'm yearning, a-for something that you've got
Temperature moving up, feel the boogie power
Taking it to the pop
Hey baby, we're getting down
When are we going to stop, come the zero hour
Rhythm ain't going to drop, it's the hottest place in town
