Title  : GOING BACK TO MY ROOTS
Artist : ODYSSEY

(Words & music: Lamont Dozier)

Zippin' up my boots
Going back to my roots
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
I've been standing in the rain
Drenched and soaked with pain
Tired of short-term benefits
And being exposed to the elements
I'm homeward bound
Got my head turned around
Ain't talkin' 'bout no roots in the land
Talkin' 'bout the roots in the man
I feel my spirit gettin' old
It's time to recharge my soul

Zippin' up my boots
Going back to my roots
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth
I'm howard bound
Got my head turned round

Zippin' up my boots
Going back to my roots
To the place of my birth
Back down to earth

Kawa oma ranti ishedale baba awa
(We will always remember our roots)
