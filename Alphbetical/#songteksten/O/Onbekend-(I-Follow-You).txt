                      I follow you


I love your sweet sweet walking
I love your warm brown wonderful eyes
I love your sweet smalltalking
but tell me what can I break the eyes 
what can I do

and i'll follow you (yes I follow you)
to the end of the world
and I'll follow you (yes I follow you)
to the end of the world

to the end of the world to the end of the world

I love your sweet sweet smile ...
