
11. The Offspring - Self Esteem

I wrote her off
For the 10th time today
And practiced all the things
I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back
And made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's Ok man
'Cause I like the abuse
I know she's playin' with me
That's OK
'Cause I got self esteem
We make plans
To go out at night
I wait till 2
Then I turn out the light
All this reaction's got me so low
If she keeps it up
I just might tell her no
When she's saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why
She sleeps with my friends
When she's saying that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder
How much more I can spend
Well I guess I should
Stick up for myself
But I really think it's better
This way the more you suffer
The more it shows you really care, right?
Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks
On my door drunk again
And looking to score 
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard
When she's ready to go
I may be dumb
But I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker
With no self esteem
