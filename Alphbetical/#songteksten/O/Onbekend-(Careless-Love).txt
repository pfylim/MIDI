Love, oh love, oh careless love,
love, oh love, oh careless love,
love, oh love, oh careless love,
just see what love has done to me.

Sorrow, sorrow to my heart,
sorrow, sorrow to my heart,
sorrow, sorrow to my heart,
me and my true love have to part.

I love my mama and papa too,
I love my mama and papa too,
I love my mama and papa too,
I'd leave them both to go with you.

Now my apron strings don't pin,
now my apron strings don't pin,
now my apron strings don't pin,
you pass my door and won't come in.

Now my money's spent and gone,
now my money's spent and gone,
now my money's spent and gone,
you passed my door a singing a song.

I cried all night the night before,
I cried all night the night before,
I cried all night the night before.


going cry tonight and cry no more.
