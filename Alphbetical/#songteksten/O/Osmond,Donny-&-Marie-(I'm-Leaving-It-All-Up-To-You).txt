Title  : I'M LEAVING IT (ALL) UP TO YOU

I'm leavin' it all up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?

That's why I'm leavin' it up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?

I've got my heart in my hand
I...I...I don't understand
What have I done wrong
I worship the ground you walk on

That's why I'm leavin' it up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?

I'm leavin' it all up to you
You decide what you're gonna do
Now do you want my love
Or are we through?
