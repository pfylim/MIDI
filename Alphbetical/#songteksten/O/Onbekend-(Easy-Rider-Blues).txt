Easy Rider just see what you have done,
oh Lord Easy Rider see what you have done,
well you made me love you,
now your gal has come,
well it's hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

If I was catfish,
swimmin' in the deep blue sea,
if I was catfish,
swimmin' in the deep blue sea,
I would swim across the ocean,
bring my baby back to me.
Well, it's hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

I'm goin' away, rider,
and I won't be back till fall,
I'm goin' away, rider,
and I won't be back till fall,
and if I find me a good man,
I won't be back at all.
Well, it's hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
