Title  : Three Babies
Singer : Sin‚ad O'Connor


Each of these, my three babies
I will carry with me for myself
I ask no one else will be
Mother of these three
And of course I'm like a wild horse
But there's no other way I could be
Water + feed are not tods that I need
For the thing that I've chosen to be
In my soul, my blood + my bones
I have wrapped your could bodies around me
The face on you, the smell of you
Will always be with me
Each of these, my three babies
I was not willing to leave
Though I tried I blasphemed + denied
I know they will be returned to me
Each of these, my babies
Have brought your closer to me
No longer mad like a horse
I'm still wild but not lost
From the thing that I've chosen to be
And it's 'cos you've thrilled me
Silenced me, stilled me
Proved things I never believed
The face on you, the smell of you
Will always be with me
(Repeat first eight rules)
