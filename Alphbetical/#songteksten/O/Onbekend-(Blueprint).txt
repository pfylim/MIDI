BLUEPRINT



I walk ahead alone, you tell
   me not to go so fast
But I'm slower then you think
   I am as careful as your touch
When you want me to relax
   I am as serious as your looks
When you want me to believe, Oh, Oh
Here is a blueprint of your
   past, here is a blueprint
   of your destiny
I walk ahead alone, you tell me 
   not to go so fast
REFRAIN: I sneek around the corner with a 
            blueprint of my lover
         With a blueprint of my 
            life I would better 
            run for cover
         I sneek around the corner with a
            blueprint of my lover
         With a blueprint of my
            life I would better
            run for cover

I walk ahead alone, you tell me
   never ever leave me
But I'm already gone, I am further
   than the wall, you have 
   bild around your future
I am higher than the tower you
   climb in a suicidal mood, oh, oh
Here is a blueprint of your 
   past, here is a blueprint
   of your destiny
That's all there is of you and 
   that's all there is of me, yeah !
