Sandokan, Sandokan
Make me warm and I'll fight everyday
Every night, every way

Warm and tender is the love
And people know the way to love
Cruel and bloody is the war
And people know how to make war
But the people can be unfair
When there's no one to help them there
I love my people, I love my land
And everybody seems to understand
All together
All together
All together
Hand in hand, let's go to the sun

Sandokan, Sandokan
Make me warm and I'll fight everyday
Every night, every way
Sandokan, Sandokan
Make me warm and I will be the one

Love the woman, love the man
And be a brother to your old friend
Choose the moment when to fight
And just be sure the moment's right
But the people can be unfair
When there's no one to help them there
I love my people I love my land

And everybody seems to understand
All together
All together
All together
Hand in hand, let's go to the sun
