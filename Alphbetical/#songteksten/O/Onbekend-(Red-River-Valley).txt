Titel:       RED RIVER VALLEY

Interpret:   ________________



From this valley they say you are going we will
miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say
you are taking the sunshine that has brightened our
pathways awhile.

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Come and sit by my side if you love me.
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
just remember the Red River Valley and the
cowboy that loved you so tru.
-------------------------------------------------------------

I've been thinking a long time, my darling,
of the sweet words you never would say, now, alas, must
my fond hopes all vanish ?
For they say you are going away.

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Come and sit...
-------------------------------------------------------------

Do you think of the valley you're leaving ?
O how lonely and how dreary it will be.
Do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking ?
And the pain you are causing to me ?

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Come and sit...
-------------------------------------------------------------

They will bury me where you have wandered,
near the hills where the daffodils grow,
when you're gone from the Red River Valley,
for I can't live without you I know.

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Come and sit...
-------------------------------------------------------------
