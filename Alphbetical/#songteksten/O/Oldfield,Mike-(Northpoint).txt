Have you ever been to Northpoint
to spend your time and pray
the prison walls are dark and cold and grey
the writing on the wall at Northpoint
speaks to a silent room
they shut the bars down, leave you to the gloom.

How could we get any closer,
so high is the wire
and the guards won't listen
they won't believe me
and then it all came back
somewhere far above, has a new day risen
way beyond the searchlight, comes alive.

Then on a bright day at Northpoint
the gate was open wide
they chanced to look at what was inside
there where a million stars at Northpoint
and from the silent tomb
they took it to the heart,
and left for the moon.

Have you ever been to Northpoint
to spend your time and pray
the prison walls are dark and cold and grey.
