Title  : SOUTH OF THE BORDER

(Words & music: J. Kennedy/ M.Carr)

South of the border, down Mexico way
That's were I fell in love
When stars above, came out to play
And now as I wonder, by thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way

She was a picture, in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while
I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was fiesta, and we were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Then she sighed as she whispered: ma¤ana
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered ma¤ana
For our tomorrow never came

South of the border, I rode back one day
There in a veil of white, by candlelight
She knelt to pray
The mission bells told me, that I mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Ay ay ay ay
