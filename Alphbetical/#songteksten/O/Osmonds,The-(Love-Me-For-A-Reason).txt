Title  : LOVE ME FOR A REASON

Girl when you hold me, how you control me
You bend me and fold me anyway you please
It must be easy for you
The loving things that you do
For just a past-time for you
I could never be and I never know girl
If I should stay or go
'Cause these games that you play
Keep driving me away

Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
And let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
And let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses are only minor tests
Babe of love which it stresses
Between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass girl
And proudly take a stand
I can't continue guessing
Because it's only messing up my pride
And my mind, oh
So right now it's time to tell you

Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
And let the reason be love

Oh baby, I'm just a little old fashioned
It takes more than a physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of love

Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
And let the reason be love
