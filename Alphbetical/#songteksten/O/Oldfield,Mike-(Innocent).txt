I know you'll never stay the same
In time most of us lose it
But I'm hoping just the same
You'll shine
And learn how to use it
Speak to me like the very first speak
You are magnificent when you're innocent
Laugh to me like the very first laugh
You are from heaven sent
When you're innocent
My hands hold you
And you adore
Blue eyes trun my direction
Surprise in everything and your
Body moves in perfection
Smile to me like the very first smile
You are magnificent when you're innocent
Walk to me like the very first walk
You are from heaven sent
When you're innocent
Sunrise here comes another day
Cow jumps over the moon now
Sometime you will look back and say
Topday I'll sing my own tune
Sing to me like the very first sing
You are magnificent when you're innocent
Smile to me like the very first smile
Yopu are from heaven sent
When you're innocent
Sing to me like the very first sing
You are magnificent when you're innocent
