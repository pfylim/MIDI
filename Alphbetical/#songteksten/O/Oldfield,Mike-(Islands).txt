Islands from the first time we saw
we couldn't wait for this moment,
like rocks on the shore
we can never be closer somehow
for the moment that lasts,
is this moment now.

When the night's on fire will you keep the Candlelight Burning
hold on to your hearts desire
when you see one bird into the wind another one's turning
and the two can fly much higher.
We are Islands but never too far, we are Islands
and I need your light tonight

Islands never been to before and we climb so high
to where the wild birds soar, there's a new path that
we found just today I was lost in the forest and you
showed me the way.

When the night's on fire will you keep the Candlelight Burning
hold on to your hearts desire
when you see one bird into the wind another one's turning
and the two can fly much higher.
We are Islands but never too far, we are Islands
and I need your light tonight
