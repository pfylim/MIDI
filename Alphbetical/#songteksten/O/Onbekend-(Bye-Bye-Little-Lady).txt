BYE BYE LITTLE LADY


Little little lady feel it like a man
little little lady try it if you can

I am just a shadow have to go my way
searching for a meadow where I'm bound to stay

You can make it better don't have such a farm
understand the matter i never let you down

Refrain:
Bye bye little lady you know I'm just a butterfly
bye bye little lady I'm gonna fly bye bye bye

Little little lady looking to my eyes
little little lady where you see no lie
talking to you baby looking for a smile
I'm a lonley maybe come back in a while

Refrain:

solo

I am just a shadow have to go my way 
searching for a madow where I'm bound to stay

Refrain:
