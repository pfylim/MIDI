SINEAD O'CONNOR - TROY

I'll remember it and Dublin in a rainstorm
And sitting in the long grass in summer
Keeping warm I'll remember it every restless night
We were so young then we thought that
Everything we could possibly do was right and we moved
Stolen from our very eyes
And I wondered where you went to
Tell me when did the light die
You will rise
You'll return
The phoenix from the flame
You will learn
You will rise
You'll return
Being what you are
There is no other troy for you to burn
And I never meant to hurt you
I swear I didn't mean these things I said
I never meant to do that to you next time
I'll keep my hands to myself instead
Oh, does she love you
What do you want to do
Does she need you like I do
Do you love her
Is she good for you
Does she hold you like I do oh ooh
Do you want me
Should I leave
I know you're always telling me
That you love me just sometimes
I wonder if I should believe
Oh I love you 
God I love you
I'd kill a dragon for you
I'll die but I will rise
And I will return
The phoenix from the flame
I will rise
And you'll see me return
Being what I am
There is no other troy
for me to burn
And you should've let the light on
You should've let the light on
Then I wouldn't have tried and
You'd never have known
And I wouldn't have pulled you tighter
No I wouldn't have pulled you close
I wouldn't have screamed no I can't let
You go if the door wasn't closed
No I wouldn't have pulled you to me
No I wouldn't have kissed your face
You wouldn't have begged me to hold you
If we hadn't been there in the first place
Oh but I know you wanted me to be there
Oh oh every look that you threw told me so
Oh but you should've let the light on
You should've let the light on
You should've let the light on
Oh ooh oh ooh
And the men burn away 
Still spit the fire
Make no difference what you say
You're still a liar
