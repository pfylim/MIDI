CONFUSION


1) Ev'rywhere the sun is shining
   all around the world it's shining
   but cold winds blow across your mind
   confusion it's such a terrible shame
   confusion you don't know what you're sayin'

Refrain:
   you've lost your love and you just can't carry 
   on can't carry on
   you feel ther's no one there
   for you to lean on to lean on

2) Every night you're out there darlin'
   you're always out there runnin'
   and i see that lost look in your eyes
   confusion i don't know what i should do
   confusion i leave it all up to you

Refrain:
  
3) Dark as the road you wander
   and as you stand there under
   the starry sky you feel sad inside
   confusion you know it's drivin'me wild
   confusion it comes as no big surprise

Refrain:   

  Arialiss the past goodbye
   You and I were made for each other
   You you have found what you've       ys
