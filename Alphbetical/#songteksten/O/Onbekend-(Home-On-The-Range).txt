Titel:            HOME ON THE RANGE

Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam
where the deer and the antelope play
where seldom is heard a discouraging word 
and the skies are not cloudy all day.

Home, home on the range, where the deer and
the antelope play, Where seldom is heard a
discouraging word and the skies are not
cloudy all day.

Oh ! give me the land where the bright diamond sand
throws its light from the glittering streams,
where glideth along the graceful white swan,
like the maid to her heavenly dreams.

Oh ! give me a gale of the salomon vale
where the lifestream with buoyancy flow;
on the banks of the beaver, where seldom if ever,
any poisonous herbage doth grow.

How often at night, when the heavens were bright,
with the light of the twinkling stars,
Have I stood here amazed and asked as I gazed
if their glory exceeds that of ours.

I love the wild flowers in this bright land of ours,
I love the wild curlew's shrill scream;
The bluffs and white rocks and antelope flocks,
that graze on the mountain so green.

The air is so pure and the breezes so free,
the zephyrs so balmly and light,
that I would not exchange my home here to range
forever in azures so bright.
