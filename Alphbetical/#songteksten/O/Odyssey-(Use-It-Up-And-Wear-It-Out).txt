Title  : USE IT UP AND WEAR IT OUT
Artist : ODYSSEY

(Words & music: S. Linzer/L. Russel Brown)

Shake, shake your body down
Shake, shake your body down

Ev'rybody, all you people gather 'round
And get your body busy
Move it up and groove it down
Gonna use it up, gonna wear it out
Ain't nothing left in this whole world
I care about
I said: one, two, three, shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, shake your body down to me
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, oh, shake

(repeat)

Shake, shake your body down
Use it up, wear it out
Ain't nothing left in this whole world
I care about
I said: one, two, three, shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, shake your body down to me
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, shake your body down
(Shake it down to me)
One, two, three, oh, shake

Do it all night, do it all night long
Do it all night long, do it all night
