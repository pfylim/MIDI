Standind at the corner
Having you on my mind
Can hardly wait to have you by my side

Sittin' in the school-bus
Having you by my side
I know a lot of things we can do right

Rock'n' roll in old blue jeans
Playing my guitar
Riding on a motor bike
Driving daddy's car
Making music just for fun
With you by my side
Rock'n' roll and you are what I like

Sittin' in the class-room
Having you on my mind
I'm always waiting for the bell to ring

Looking at the teacher
Is not easy all the time
'Cause I know better places we can find

Rock'n' roll in old blue jeans,...

I don't want to be a freak
Linger in a bar
Smoke a thousand cigrattes
Decorate with scars
I don't mind to do my job
Clean the dishes too
Added to my pocket-money
This will do for two.

Walking in the school-yard
Having you on my mind
Can hardly wait to see your smiling face
Sitting in the school-bus
Having you by my side
I'm always yearning for your sweet embrace

Sitting in the class-room
Having you on my mind,...

Rock'n' roll in old blue jeans,...
Rock'n' roll and you are what I like
Rock'n' roll and you are what I like
