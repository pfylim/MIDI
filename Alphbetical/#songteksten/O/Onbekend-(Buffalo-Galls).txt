As I was lumb'ring down the street,
down the street, down the street.
A handsome gal I chanced to meet, oh,
she was fair to view.
Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight,
can't you come out tonight,
can't you come out tonight ?
Buffalo Gals, can't you come out tonight,
and dance by the light of the moon.
