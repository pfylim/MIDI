Titel:         WORRIED MAN BLUES

Interpret:     _________________


It takes a worried man to sing a worried song  (3x)
I'm worried now but I won't be worried long.

I went across the river and I lay down to sleep  (3x)
and I woke up with shackles on my feet.

Twenty nine links of chain around my leg,        (3x)
and on each link the initial of my name.

I asked the judge what might be my fine.         (3x)
Twenty one years on the R.C. Mountain Line.

Twenty one years to pay my awful crime,          (3x)
Twenty one years - but I got ninety nine.

The train arrived sixteen coaches long,          (3x)
The girl I love is on that train and gone.

I looked down the track as far as I could see,   (3x)
little bitty hand was waving after me.

If anyone should ask you who composed this song  (3x)
tell them it was I and I sing it all day long.
