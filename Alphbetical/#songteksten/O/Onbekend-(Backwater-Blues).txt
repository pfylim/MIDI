When it rains five days
and the sky turns dark at night.
When it rains five days
and the sky turns dark at night
there is trouble taking place
in the lowlands at night.

When it thunders and it lightnings
and the wind begins to blow.
When it thunders and it lightnings
and the wind begins to blow
there are thousands of people
who ain't no place to go.

They rowed little boat
about five miles 'cross the pond.
They rowed little boat
about five miles 'cross the pond.
I packed all my things, throwed 'em in,
and they rowed me along.

Then I went and stood upon
some high old lonesome hill.
Then I went and stood upon
some high old lonesome hill
then I looked down on the place
where I used to live.

Backwater Blues
done caused me pack my things and go.
Backwater Blues
done caused me pack my things and go
'cos my house felt down
and I can't live there no more.
