Take this hammer carry it to the captain,
take this hammer carry it to the captain,
take this hammer carry it to the captain,
tell him I'm gone
tell him I'm gone.

If he asks you was I runnin'
If he asks you was I runnin'
If he asks you was I runnin'
tell him I's flyin'
tell him I's flyin'.

If he asks me was I laughin'   (3x)
tell him I's cryin'
tell him I's cryin'.

I don't want no peas, cornbread and tomatoes   (3x)
they hurt my pride, 
they hurt my pride.

I'm gonna bust right, bust right past that shooter   (3x)
I'm goin' home,
I'm goin home.
