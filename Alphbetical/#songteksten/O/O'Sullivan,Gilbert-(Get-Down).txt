Told you once before
and I won't tell you no more, get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around
You give me the creeps when you jump on my feet
get down, get down, get down,
Keep your hands to yourself
I'm strictly out of bounds

Once upon a time I drank a little wine
I was as happy as could be
Happy as I could be
But now I'm just a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what are you thinkin' you're doing to me
Told you once before
and I won't tell you no more, get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around
I don't give a damn and I like you if you can't
So get down, get down, get down, 
You're a bad dog, baby 
But I still want you around
Once upon a time I drank a little wine
I was as happy as could be
Happy as I could be
But now I'm just a cat on a hot tin roof
Baby what are you thinkin' you're doing to me
Told you once before
and I won't tell you no more, get down, get down, get down
You're a bad dog, baby
But I still want you around
