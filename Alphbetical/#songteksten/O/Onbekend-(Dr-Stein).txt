DR.STEIN


Once they killed his monster 
   when it went into a trap
Now he's making better ones 
   on a higher step
On a warm summer day the doctor 
   went away
To a place where he could 
   make it real
His assistant's hips were nice
So he cloned them once or twice
Now his hips are aching what a deal
REFRAIN: Dr.Stein grows funny creatures
         let's them run into the night
         They become great
         1.rock musicians
         2.politicians
         3.a great possession
         4.a great oppression
         And their time is right
Sometimes when he's feeling bored
He's calling it a day
He's got his computers and they do it
   their own way
They mix some DNA, some skin
   and a certain spray
You can watch it on a laser screen
And the fellow's blue and grey
Or sometimes pink and green
Just check it out on Halloween
REFRAIN: 
One night he cloned himself
Put his brother on a shelf
But when he fell asleep that night
It crept up from behind and thought
   "well never mind"
Took a syringe and blew out his life

Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great

REFRAIN
