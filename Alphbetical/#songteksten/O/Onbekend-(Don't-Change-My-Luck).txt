   DON'T CHANGE MY LUCK


   Well you may not have this points of view
   but as a matter of fact 
   I think you've done right rude
   it takes some people apart the way you do.
   
   So here we are sitting in this restaurant
   and I'm so tired of hearin' about what you want
   oh maybe you've forgotten
   just who you're talkin' to.
   
   Well for three long years I was waitin' to hear
   just a few words from you
   that would make me sincere
   oh I knew it ain't gonna be easy 
   forgetting about you.

   So if you don't mind I will simply explain
   that I've found someone new and I'm living again
   and the last thing I need is your sympathy
   so try to understand and please
   don't keep putting him down.

Refrain: Don't change my luck
         I'm so tired of being moved around
         don't change my luck
         well for three long years I was on my own
         now I've finally found him
         Baby don't change my luck
         now that I've found him
         please don't change my luck.

   Oh there were so many times I was ready to leave
   I had so many reasons that you'd never believe
   I stuck around like the fool you tought me to be.

   Oh and I can't help it if you don't understand
   and I won't take the blame but baby you can
   and anyway it's time 
   you've learned a few things about me.
   
   Oh yes baby this is really the end
   and when I walked out of here
   you won't see me again
   and this time I'm taking my life with me
   so please baby, please please
   don't keep hangin' around.

Refrain:
