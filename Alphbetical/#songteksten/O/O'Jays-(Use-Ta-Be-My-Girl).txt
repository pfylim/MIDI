Title  : USE TA BE MY GIRL

(Words & music: Ken Gamble/Leon Huff)

Ooh, good lovin', the girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know, and I'll tell you so
She use ta be my girl

I respect her, when she was mine I use ta neglect her
She wanted more than I could give
But as long as I live, she'll be my girl

Chorus:
She use ta be my girl
She use ta be my girl
She use ta be my girl
She had en charmin' personality
The girl was so right for me
She's my girl, and if I had the chance
Lord knows, I'd take her back
As a matter of fact right away, like today

Not only good looking
The girl was so smart
You can't beat her cooking
Ask me how I know, and I'll tell you so
She use ta be my girl

Chorus: ...

Deep down inside I still love her
Place no one above her
She's warm and sensitive
For as long as I live
She'll be my girl
And if I had the chance
I'd take her back
As a matter of fact right away, like today
Ooh, good lovin', the girl's got plenty good lovin'
Ask me how I know, and I'll tell you so
She use ta be my girl

Chorus: ...
