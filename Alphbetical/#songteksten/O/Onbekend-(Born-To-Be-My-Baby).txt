BORN TO BE MY BABY



Rainy night
   and we worked all day
We both got jobs
   'cause there's bills to pay
We got something they can't take away:
   our love, our lives
Close the door, leave the cold outside
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side
We got something that will never die:
   our dreams, our pride

My heart beats like a drum -
   all night
Flesh to flesh, one to one -
   and it's alright
And I'll never let go
   'cause there's something I know deep inside

You were born to be my baby,
   and baby, I was made to be your man
We got something to believe in,
   even if we don't know where we stand
Only god would know the reasons,
   but I bet he must have had a plan
'cause you were born to be my baby,
   and baby, I was made to be your man

Light a candle, blow the world away,
   table for two on a TV tray
It ain't fanoy, baby,
   that's okay -
   our time, our way a bumpy ride
So hold me close, better hang on tight,
   buckle up, baby, it's our fight
We're two kids
   hitching down the road of life - our world

If we stand side by side - all night
There's a chance we'll get by -
   and it's alright
And I'll know that you'll live in my heart
   till the day that I die

'cause you were born to be my baby ...
My heart beats like a drum -
   all night
You were born to be my baby, and baby,
   I was made to be your man
You were born to be my baby, and baby,
   I was made to be your man
