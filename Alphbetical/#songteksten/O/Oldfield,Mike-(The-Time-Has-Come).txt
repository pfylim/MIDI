Titel:        THE TIME HAS COME

A thousand years they waited for
someone who would be true
and now the empty years have passed
the sunlight shines anew

Someone who knows to fear
I feel him near
the child was born to be a king, a king,
and the time has come.

He tamed the wild wind when he passed
the birds and beasts he knew
until he came to rest at last
the tall gates he passed through.

And now the story's just begun
A thousand years to stay
we wake each morning with the sun
to live our dreams away.

And now the story's just begun
A thousand years to stay
we wake each morning with the sun
to live our dreams away.
