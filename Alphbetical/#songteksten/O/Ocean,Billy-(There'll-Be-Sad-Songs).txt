BILLY OCEAN - THERE'LL BE SAD SONGS (TO MAKE YOU CRY)


Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)

I often wonder how it could be
You loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony

I count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays
A melody for you and me

Until the moment when you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I will wait for

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

You're my desire
You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Saying I love you
I love you
