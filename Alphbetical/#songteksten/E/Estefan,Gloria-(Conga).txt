Title  : Conga
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Come on, shake your body, baby
Do the Conga
I know you can't control yourself
Any longer
Come on, shake your body, baby
Do the Conga
I know you can't control yourself
Any longer

Come on, shake your body, baby
Do the Conga
I know you can't control yourself
Any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music
Getting stronger
Don't you fight it, till you try to
Do the Conga beat
(Repeat)

Everybody gather round now
Let your body feel the heat
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet
It's the rhythm of the island
And that sugar cane so sweet
If you want to do the Conga
You've got to listen to the beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the right away
From tonight we're gonna party
Till we see the break of day
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you've got
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop

Come on, shake your body, baby
Do the Conga
