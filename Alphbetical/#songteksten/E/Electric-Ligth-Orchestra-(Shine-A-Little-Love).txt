Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize,
I guess you had your way,
you see I gotta make you understand,
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say,
but it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day.

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.

Remember, tonight we're gonna run till dawn,
remember, tonight we're gonna say,
we'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on,
I know you've heard it all before,
but I really need you darlin' every day I need you more.

You shine a little love on my life,...

Can you understand, (Yes, I understand) Can you feel it's right,
(I know it is) Will you be the same, (I'll do it again).

It's been a year now and it's getting so much better,
you came home without a word,
though everybody said you'll soon forget her,
they couldn't see and they just didn't understand,
and lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand.
You shine a little love on my life,...

Can you understand (Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right,...

How many days had I been waiting there to tell you,
I really can't believe,
we're walkin' out into the world tonight,
we'll do it all again until the break of light
and the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes.

You shine a little love on my life,...
