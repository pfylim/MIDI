Singer : ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA 
Title  : LIVIN' THING

(Words & music: Jeff Lynne)

Sailin' away on the crest of a wave
It's like magic
Oh, rollin' and ridin'
And slippin' and slidin'
It's magic
And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh
Higher and higher baby

Refrain:
It's a living thing
It's a terrible thing to lose
It's a given thing
What a terrible thing to lose

Makin' believe this is what you conceived
From your worst day
Oh, moving in line then you look back in time
To your first day
And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh
Higher and higher baby

Refrain: ...

Takin' a dive 'cause you can't halt
The slide, floating downstream
So let her go, don't start spoiling the show
It's a bad dream
And you and your sweet desire
You took me, oh
Higher and higher baby

Refrain: ...
