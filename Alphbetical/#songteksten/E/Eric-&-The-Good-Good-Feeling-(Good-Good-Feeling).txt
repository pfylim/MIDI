ERIC & THE GOOD GOOD FEELING - GOOD GOOD FEELING

(Words & music: ...)

Hey ma, stop that baby from screaming
Here comes Eric and the good good feeling

Every night and day
I want to be with you
I want to call you up
And say these words to you
Come over, take away
Oh baby take a ride
Keep me coming on the inside

Good good feeling
Dressed for passion on a friday night
Good good feeling
Hot pink lips kiss the city lights
Good good feeling
Cruisin' in my car
Good good feeling
Rockin' the Zanzibar

Red light green light
Bouncing off the wall
Good good feeling
Keeps me coming for more

Good good feeling
Quest for action
And my body moves
Good good feeling
Dancing fancy in a party room
Good good feeling
Another bottle without a cork
Good good feeling
Topping the party up

Red light green light
Bouncing off the wall
Good good feeling
Keeps me coming for more

Hey ma, stop that baby from screaming
Here comes Eric and the good good feeling

Good good feeling
Feel it coming over you
Good good feeling
Take it where you want to
Good good feeling
Feeling good tonight
Good good feeling
Shake it to the left
Shake it to the right

Red light green light
Bouncing off the wall
Good good feeling
Keeps me coming for more

Good good feeling
Every day
Every night
Good good feeling in my sight
Good good feeling
