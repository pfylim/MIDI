Title  : IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it don't matter how I cry
My tears of love a waste of time
If I turn away, am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

Chorus:
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you ah ah
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you ah ah

Can't let go
And it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you, my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do

Chorus: ...
