Singer : THE EAGLES 
Title  : ONE OF THESE NIGHTS 
 
One of these nights, one of these crazy old nights 
We're gonna find you pretty mama 
What turns on your lights 
The full moon is calling, the fever is high 
And the wicked wind whispers and moans 
You got your demons, you got desires 
Well, I got a few of my own 
Ooh someone to be kind to in between the dark and 
the light 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 
 
One of these dreams, one of these lose and lonely dreams 
We're gonna find one, girl 
One that really screams 
I've been searching for the daughter of the 
devil himself 
I've been searching for an angel in white 
I've been waiting for a woman who's a little of both 
And I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight 
Ooh, loneliness will bind you in between 
the wrong and the right 
Ooh, coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you one of these nights 
 
One of these nights in between the dark and the light 
Coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you 
Get you baby, one of these nights 
One of these nights 
One of these nights
