E.G. DAILY - SAY IT, SAY IT

REFRAIN:
If you want my love say it, say it (now darling)
Got to let it out say it, say it (yeah)
If you want my love say it, say it (don't worry)
What it's all about say it, say it (yeah)

When I'm with you
You know just what the right things are to do
Your actions move me
But your attitude it makes me so confused

You lead me on in the right direction
Then you let me down, put up protection
I ain't gonna be your sacrifice
Just a few words that might sound nice
It ain't no use in playing games
I'm wanting you, do you feel the same
When it comes down to the bottom line
I really got to know am I wasting time

REFRAIN: ...

I can see right through you
You're not as cool as you pretend to be
Your reactions tell me
You're just waiting for the worst
To come from me

You lead me on in the right direction
Then you let me down, put up protection
I ain't gonna be your sacrifice
Just a few words that might sound nice
It ain't no use in playing games
I'm wanting you, do you feel the same
When it comes down to the bottom line
I really got to know am I wasting time

REFRAIN: ...

Don't try to disguise
What's in your eyes
They're so revealing
I know you're afraid
But it's OK
Say what you feel

REFRAIN: ...

Don't try to disguise
What's in your eyes
They're so revealing
I know you're afraid
But it's OK
Say what you feel

REFRAIN: ...(3x)...
