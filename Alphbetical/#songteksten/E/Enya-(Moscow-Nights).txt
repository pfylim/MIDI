ANYA - MOSCOW NIGHTS

Once I loved a Russian
Nikkita was his name
He said I was his only love
But I could spot Nick's game
He tried to use me
I heard he had his lovers
A blond girl in the shed
A dark in the cupboard
And a little red under the bed
He didn't fool me
But how I miss his song
My world has all gone wrong

Refrain:
Oh, Moscow nights are cold
Without your love to hold
And I don't know where to go
There's nothing there but snow
Oh, Moscow nights are cold
Without your love to hold
And I don't know where to go
There's nothing there but snow

We had nights of passion by the Baltic sea
We made love in Russian, just the vodka, him and me
We had a good time
But then he started messin'
I said I'd had enough, and late that night
We had a fight and he left in a huff
It was a bad time
So girls take my advice
Their hearts are cold as ice

Refrain: ...
