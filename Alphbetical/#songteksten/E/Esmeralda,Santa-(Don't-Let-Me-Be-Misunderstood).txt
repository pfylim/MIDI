         Don't let me be misunderstood           Santa Esmeralda               


Baby, do you understand me now,
sometimes I feel a little mad,
but don't you know that no-one in life can always be an angel,
when things go wrong, I seem to be bad.

'cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

Short Bridge...

If I seem edgy, I want you to know,
that I never meant to take it out on you,
life has its problems, an' I've got my share,
that's one thing I never meant to do, 'cause I love you.

Baby, don't you know I'm just human,
an', I've got thoughts like any other man,
an' sometimes I feel myself alone, regrettin',
some foolish thing, some foolish thing I've done.

'cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.

Bridge...

Oh Lord, don't you let me be misunderstood,
don't let me be, don't let me me be misunderstood,
oh no no.

Music to finish...
