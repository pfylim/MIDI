I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies 
'cause they're just clouds passing by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

Heaven is a goodness time. A brighter light on high.

*** gesprochen ***
Do unto others as you would have them do to you.
******************

And have a brighter by and by.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.

I believe God is now, was then and always will be.
With God's blessing we can make it through eternity.

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, Please look down and see my people through.
