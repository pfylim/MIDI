Title  : SHAME

(Words & music: John H. Fitch/Reuben Cross)

Shame, burning, you keep my whole body yearning
You got me so confused it's a shame
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
But still I wanna stay

Wrapped in your arms is where I want to be
Want to be
Wrapped in your arms that's my high

Shame, my mother says you're playin' a game
And what you do to me is a shame
I'm gonna love you just the same
Mama just don't understand

Wrapped in your arms is where I want to be
Want to be
Wrapped in my arms that's my high

I can't get enough, enough of that magic touch
Love is in my heart, tearing the rules apart
So why should I be ashamed
Only love can be to blame

If we lose our love it's a shame
Wouldn't wanna live with the pain
I'm gonna stay forever
Wrapped in your arms is where I want to be
Want to be
Wrapped in your arms, that's my high
Shame only love can be to blame
If we lose our love it's a shame
I wouldn't wanna live with the pain
Girl, it's a shame
