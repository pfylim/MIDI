Singer : EARTH, WIND & FIRE AND THE EMOTIONS 
Title  : BOOGIE WONDERLAND

(Words & music: A. Willis/J. Lind)

Midnight creeps so slowly
Into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand
To a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says baby uh uh it don't work
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

Chorus:
Dance Boogie Wonderland ha ha
Dance Boogie Wonderland ha ha
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing
And my heart keeps saying
Boogie Wonderland, Wonderland

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance
In Boogie Wonderland

Chorus: ...

Dance 
Boogie Wonderland

Chorus: ...2x...
