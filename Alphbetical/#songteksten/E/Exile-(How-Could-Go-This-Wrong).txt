Dancin' romancin'
bnut no second chancin'
nothing more
runnin' and hidin'
slippin' and slidin'
across the floor
she comes alone every night on her own
lookin' for romance
she stands there watching while everyone's touching
she'd take a chance
standing there waiting anticipating.

How could this go wrong
so many lovers holdin' on
how could this go wrong
another night goes on and on.

now everyone's fakin'
hearts have been breakin'
across the floor
he's for the makin'
she's for the takin'
nothing more
from the look in her eyes she is desperately searching
for something to say
and as he calls her over they're getting closer
she'll find a way
looking for something suddenly touching.

How could this go wrong
it's what she needed all along
how could this go wrong
and so the night goes on and on.

Dancin' romancin'
no second chancin'
across the floor
he's for the makin'
she's for the takin'
nothing more
still she comes alone every night on her own
lookin' for romance
she stands there watching while everyone's touching
she'd take a chance
standing there waiting anticipating
lookin' for something suddenly touching.

How could this go wrong
she thought he loved her all along
how could this go wrong
so many lovers holding on
how could this go wrong
she thought he loved her all along
how could this go wrong
and so the night goes on and on
how could this go wrong,...
