One of these Nights

INTRO:
	G	C	G	D   C

    G			    C
All alone at the end of the evening
        G			    C
and the bright lights have faded to blue.
      G		       B7		    Em
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me,
            D
but I never knew.
G		      D		    G			   C
	You know I've always been a dreamer (spend my life runnin' round)
	 C	    G
and it's so hard to change (can't seem to settle down)
	C		 Am	C
but the dreams I've seen lately   keep on turnin' out
    C/D		    D		    C/D	 D
and burnin' out and turnin' out the sa - me.

CHORUS:
   C	       G	   C	     G
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
    C		   D		  G
and take it to the limit one more   time.

INTERLUDE:
G	C	G	D  C

	G			    C
You can spend all your time making money,
	   G			      C
Or you can spend all your love making time.
      G		  B7	    Em
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
		   D
would you still be mine?
G		    D		     G		     C
    And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care)
		       G		   C
And you can't find the door (can't find it anywhere)
	     C		  Am	   C		  C
when there's nothing to believe in   still you're coming back,
       C/D		    D		    C/D  D
you're running back, you're coming back for mo - re.

CHORUS:
   C	       G	   C	     G
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
    C		   D	       Em
and take it to the limit one more time.

|:   C	       D      C		     D
