
More than words

Saying I love you
is not the words
I want to hear from you
it's not that I want you
not to say
but if you only knew

How easy
it would be to
show me how I feel
more than words
is all you have to do
to make it real
then you wound'nt
have to say
that you love me
i'd already know

What would you do
if my heart
was torn in two
more than words
to show you feel
that your love
for me is real
what would you say
if I look
those words away
then you could'nt
make things new
just by saying
i love you
more than words
more than words

Now that I've tried to
talk to you
and make you understand
all you have to do
is close your eyes
and just reach out your hands

And touch me
hold me close
don't ever let me go
more than words
is all I ever
needed you to show
then you would'nt
have to say
that you love me
cause i'd allready know
