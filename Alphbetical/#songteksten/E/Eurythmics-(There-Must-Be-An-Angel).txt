EURYTHMICS - THERE MUST BE AN ANGEL (PLAYING IN MY HEART)

No one on earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart yeah
I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of angels
And they're playing with my heart

Refrain:
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel
Must be talking to an angel

Refrain: ...(3x)...

No one on earth could feel like this
I'm thrown and overblown with bliss
There must be an angel
Playing with my heart yeah
And when I think that I'm alone
It seems that there's more of us at home
It's a multitude of angels
And they're playing with my heart

Refrain: ...(4x)...

I must be hallucinating
Watching angels celebrating
Could this be reactivating
All my senses dislocating
This must be a strange deception
By celestial intervention
Leaving me the recollection
Of your heavenly connection

I walk into an empty room
And suddenly my heart goes boom
It's an orchestra of angels
And they're playing with my heart yeah
