This song is another country addition by Leadon off the
first album.  I was planning on figuring it out later
this week, but I sat down with it today and got it in
less than 10 minutes.  I was impressed.  Well, enough
about me, here's the song.  Have fun!

<HR WIDTH=40%><I>This is the intro.  I decided to tab it out so it would be
easier to read and figure out, because Bernie plays with the
chords a little.  <B>What I have here keeps repeating whenever
I say E in my tab.</B>  There's also a swing feel on this, so
the beats aren't all equal.  Play it and you'll see what I mean.
It starts the song, and continues up to the lyrics below.</I>

I looked right at the facts there

But I may as well have been completely blind

She signed me to a contract
Baby said it would all be so life-long
I looked around then for a reason
When there wasn't somethin' more to blame it on

But if time makes a difference while we're gone
Tell me now and I won't be hangin' on
There's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on

Was the address that I wrote down on my sleeve
I don't know just what she wanted
Might have been that it was gettin' time to leave

And I watched as the smoker passed it on
And I laughed when the joker said "lead on"
Cause there's a train leaves here this mornin'
I don't know what I might be on
