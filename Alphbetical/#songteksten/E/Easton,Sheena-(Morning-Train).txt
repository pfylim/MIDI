Title  : MORNING TRAIN
Artist : SHEENA EASTON

(Words & music: Florrie Palmer)

I wake up every morning, I stumble out of bed
A stretching and a yawning, another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe me's together, then it starts to fly
'Cause the moment babe is with me, time can take a flight
The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time
We make love
That is his and my time
We take off

Chorus:
My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five
And then, he takes another home again
To find me waiting for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow-dance or boogie, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch a light
Only what he gives me, makes me feel alright
Work all day, earn his pay
So we can play all night

All day I think of him, dreaming of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
(He) works all day (to) earn his pay
So we can play all night

Chorus: ...

He's always on that morning train
He works from nine to five
And he takes another (etc.)
