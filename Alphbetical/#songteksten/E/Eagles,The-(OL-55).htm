OL' 55
Tom Waits

Eagles
On the Border
1974

This cover of a Tom Waits ballad is so great.  Frey and Henley share
vocals, the piano is great, and the chorus has a wonderful hook to it.
It's really easy to play, so have fun!  A friend of mine named James
Wiebeck sent this to me a while back, and I checked it out and put it
up today.  Thanks, James!
