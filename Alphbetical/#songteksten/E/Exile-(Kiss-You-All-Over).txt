Singer : EXILE 
Title  : KISS YOU ALL OVER

(Words & music: M. Chapman/N. Chinn)

When I get home, babe, gonna light your fire
All day I been thinkin' about you babe
You're my one desire
Gonna wrap my arms around you
Hold you close to me
Oh babe, I want to taste your lips
Want to fill your fantasy, yeah

I don't know what I'd do without you, baby
Don't know where I'd be
You're not just another lover, no
You are everything to me
Every time I'm with you baby
I can't believe it's true
When you're laying in my arms
And you do the things you do
You can see it in my eyes
I can feel it in your touch
You don't have to say a thing
Just let me show how much

Chorus:
I love you, need you, yeah
I want to kiss you all over
And over again
I want to kiss you all over
Till the night closes in
Till the night closes in

Stay with me, play with me
Holding me, loving me baby

No one else could ever make me feel the way you do
Keep on loving me, baby
And I'll keep loving you
Easy to see when something's right or something's wrong
Stay with me, baby and hold me all night long
Show me, show me everything you do
'Cause baby, no one does it like you

C
Chorus: ...

Here with me, near with me
Feeling you close to me, baby
