I took some time one Friday night and figured this one out.  I don't know if it's right
but it's pretty close.  I really like the song so have lots of fun.


INTRO:
|      |       |       |	|
G  Em  Am      D7      G  D/F#


   G		Em		  Am
It seems like a dream now, it was so long ago,
    D				  C	       D7
The moon burned so bright and the time went so slow,
      G		   Em		 Am
And I swore that I loved her and gave her a ring.
    D		 D7	     G
The bluebird was high on the wing.


CHORUS:
C	 G	     Am	      G
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
C	  G		 Am7	     F
Finding a sweetheart and holding her tight?
	  C	       G	Am      G
She said "Tell me, oh, tell me, was I alright?"
C	 G	     Am	      G
Whatever happened to Saturday night?


    G		      Em	  Am
The years brought the railroad it ran by my door.
	    D		  	      C		  D7
Now there's boards on the windows and dust on the floor
	G	   Em	    Am
And she passes the time at another man's side,
    D	       D7	    G
And I pass the time with my pride.


BRIDGE:
C	       G      Em(addG)   C		  G	   Em(addG)
What a tangled web we weave, go 'round with circumstance.
C		G      Em(add G)  Em7      C      G
Someone show me how to tell the   dancer   from   the dance.


SOLO:
|	 |	  |	   |      |       |
Am  Em7  Am  Em7  Am  Em7  C  D


C	 G	     Am       G
Whatever happened to Saturday night
C	   G	      Am7      F
Choosing a friend and losing a fight?
	   C		G	 Am	   G
She said, "Tell me, oh, tell me, are you alright?"
C	 G	     Am	      Em
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
C	 G	     Am	      G	     G/B(addB)  G
Whatever happened to Saturday night?
