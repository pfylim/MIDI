   Ref: If you change your mind,.. I'm the first in line.
        Honey, I'm still free... Take a chance on me.
        If you need me,.. let me know gonna be around.
        If you got no place to go,.. when you're feeling down.

        If you're all alone...when the pretty birds.. have flown
	Honey, I'm still free...take a chance on me.		 				 
	Gonna do my ve..ry best and it ain't no lie.
	If you put me to...the rest, if you let me try.
	Take a chance on me.........Take a chance on me. 
          
   1.   We can go dancing,   we can go walking as long as we're together.
	Listen to some music,   may be just talking, get to know me better.
	'Cause you know I got   so much that I wanna do.
	When I dream I'm alone with you,  it's magic.
	You want me to leave it there,  afraid of a love affair, 
	but I think you know,    that I can't let go.

   2.  	Oh, you can take your time,baby.I'm in no hurry I know I'm gonna get you.
	You don't wanna hurt me,  baby, don't worry. I ain't gonna let you.
	Let me tell you know,  my love is strong enough
	to last when things are rough,   it's magic.
	You say that I waste my time,   but I can't get it of my mind.
	No I can't let go,    'cause I love you so.
