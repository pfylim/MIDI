Singer : EARTH & FIRE 
Title  : LOVE OF LIFE

Why don't you give me love like before
Ooh you know it hurts me so
Why don't you pay attention to me
Like you used to do before

Refrain:
'Cause I love you, 'cause I love you
Can you give me love of life?

I thought that we could make it yeah
But now I feel so insecure
Don't deceive me, tell me straight
If you don't love me anymore

Refrain: ...

What's going on in your mind these days
So long I've tried to understand
Ooh I hate this slipping away
Won't you please take my hand

Refrain: ...

Time has opened my eyes
And now I realize
Why did you let me down
In love of life?
