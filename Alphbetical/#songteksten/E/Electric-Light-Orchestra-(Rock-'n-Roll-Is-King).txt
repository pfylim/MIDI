  9. Rock 'n' Roll Is King - Electric Light Orchestra
  
  Well, listen everybody
  Let me tell you about the rock 'n' roll
  Oh, feel that rhythm
  And it's really gonna thrill you so
  Mmm, come along with me
  To a land of make believe
  She said:
  "Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king".
  
  She lives on rock 'n 'roll
  And she plays it all night long
  Oh, that's all she ever tells me
  When I call her on the telephone 
  She says:
  " Feel that jumping beat
  And get up on your feet".
  She says:
  "Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king".
  
  Oh, let those kid socks play
  Play for me, play for me
  Oh, let that song ring out
  That's how it's meant to be.
  
  Well, it rolls like a train
  That's coming on down the track 
  She rolled over bed over me
  And she gave Tchaikovsky back
  Oh, she loves that driving beat
  She goes dancing on down the street
  She said:
  "Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king".
  
  Oh, rock on.
  
  Oh, let those kid socks play
  Play for me, play for me
  Oh, let that song ring out
  That's how it's meant to be.
  
  Well, when she comes around
  And I'm listening to the radio
  She says:
  "You can't do that
  'Cause all I want to do is rock 'n roll
  Now, here I'm gonna stay 
  When that music starts to play".
  She says:
  "Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king"
  Oh, yeah
  Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king"
  Oh oh
  Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king
  Ooh yeah
  Wamalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king
  She said:
  "Ramalamabamalama
  Rock 'n roll is king".
