EURYTHMICS - IT'S ALRIGHT (BABY'S COMING BACK)

Refrain:
It's alright - baby's coming back
And I don't really care where he's been
It's alright - baby's coming back
And I won't turn him down this time - no no no

I'll be your cliff (you can fall down from me)
I'll be your ledge (you can lean upon me)
I'll be your bridge (your flowering tree)
You can still depend on me
And I'll be (the ticking  of your clock)
And I'll be (the numbers on your watch)
And I'll be (your hands to stop the time)
I'll even be your danger sign

Refrain: ...

And I'll be (your grace, your dignity)
And I'll be (your night, your destiny)
And I'll be (your comfort and your ease)
I will be your storm at seas
And I'll be (your sharp intake of breath)
And I'll be (your work I'll take no rest)
And when the world falls to decline
I'll be yours and you'll be mine

Refrain: ...

I'll be your cliff (you can fall down from me)
I'll be your ledge (you can lean upon me)
I'll be your bridge (your flowering tree)
You can still depend on me
And I'll be (the ticking  of your clock)
And I'll be (the numbers on your watch)
And I'll be (your hands to stop the time)
I'll even be your danger sign

(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
It's alright baby's coming back
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
And I won't turn him around this time
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
It's alright - baby's coming back
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
And I don't really care where he's been

(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
It's alright baby's coming back
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
And I won't turn him around this time
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
It's alright - baby's coming back
(Make it easy on yourself tonight)
And I don't really care where he's been
