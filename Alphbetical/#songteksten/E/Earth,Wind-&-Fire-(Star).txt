Chorus:
In the sky shines a star
Spaces near and far
Calling out who you are
Smiling in the night
Star light, star briht
Beam across the sky
Fallin', callin', can you tell me why
Star light, star bright
Mighty lite to see
Shinin', smilin' down on you and me

Chorus: ...

I can feel the dark take the night apart
But then the stars come out and lift my heart
Believin' there's a star for ev'ryone
Makes it easier to recall
That together
For the children of the world
There's a star smilin' for us
Star light, star bright
Mighty lite to see
Shinin' smilin' down on you and me
Star light, star bright
Mighty lite to see

Star hides from the rain
Turn against the pain
Fooling many in the game
While smiling in the night

Chorus: ...

Star shining high
Cultivating my desire
Graceful in the sky
Ans smiling in the night

Chorus: ...
