Singer : BELLE EPOQUE 
Title  : BLACK IS BLACK

(Words & music: Los Bravos)

We like the music, we like the disco sound
Black is black (10x)

Chorus:
Black is black, black
I want my baby back
It's grey, it's grey
Since she went away
Oh, oh, oh, what can I do
'Cause I'm feeling blue

If I had my way
He'll be back today
But he ran away
To see him again someday
What can I do
'Cause I'm feeling blue

Chorus: ...

I started too
It's too much to loose
And my love still strong
Maybe he will come back to me
And it can't go wrong

Since he went away
