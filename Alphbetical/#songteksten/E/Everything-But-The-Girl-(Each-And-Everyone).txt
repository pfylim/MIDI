Title  : Each And Everyone
Singer : Everything But The Girl


If you ever feel the time
To drop me a loving line
Maybe you should just think twice
I don't wait around on your advice
You tell me I can go this far
But no more
Try to show me heaven
And then slam the door
You offer shelter at a price
Much too dear
And your kind of love
Is the kind that soon disappears

So don't brag how you have changed
And everything's been rearranged
I thought all that was over and done
But I still get the same from
Each and everyone
Being kind is just a way
To keep me under your thumb
And I can cry because that's
Something we've always done
You tell me I'm free of the past now
And all those lies
Then offer me the same thing
In a different guise
