Draem dream dream    dream dream dream dream
when I'm with you in my arms
when I want you and all your charms
whenever I want you all I have to do is
dream dream dream dream

When I feel blue in the night
and I need you to hold me tight
whenever I want you all i have to do is - dream

I can't make you mine taste your lips of wine
anytime - night or day
only trouble is treadness I'm dreamin'my night away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
whatever I want you all I have to do is
dream dream dream dream

I can't make you mine taste your lips of wine
anytime - night or day
only trouble is treadness I'm dreamin' my night away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
whatever I want you all i have to do is
dream dream dream dream
dream dream dream dream
