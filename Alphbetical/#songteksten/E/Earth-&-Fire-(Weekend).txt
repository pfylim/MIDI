Singer : EARTH & FIRE
Title  : WEEKEND

(Words & music: Gerard Koerts)

Sunday and it's so hard to say goodbye
I don't know what to do
Bare seems the day without you
Friday night when I'll see you again
You make a fool out of me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

Sometimes when I'm looking at your face
There's something in your eyes
That makes me realize we've got no chance
If we're going on this wah
Means such a lot to me
I don't wanna be your lover for the weekend

Love, love, in a woman's heart
I wanna have the whole and not a part
It's strange that this feeling is growing more and more
'Cause I've never loved someone like you before
