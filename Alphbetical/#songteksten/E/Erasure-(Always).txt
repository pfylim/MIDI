
2. ALWAYS - ERASURE

OPEN YOUR EYES
I SEE
YOUR EYES ARE OPEN
WEAR NO DISGUISE
COME INTO THE OPEN
WHEN IT'S COLD - WHEN IT'S COLD
OUTSIDE - OUTSIDE
AM I HERE IN VAIN
HOLD ON TO BE THE NIGHT
THERE WILL BE NO SHAME

CHORUS:
ALWAYS I WANA BE WITH YOU
AND I MAKE BELIEVE WITH YOU
AND LIVE
IN HARMONY, HARMONY
OH LOVE

ALWAYS
MELTING THE ICE FOR ME
JUMP INTO THE OCEAN
HOLD BACK THE TIDE
I SEE
YOUR LOVE IN MOTION
WHEN IT'S COLD OUTSIDE
AM I HERE IN VAIN
HOLD ON TO THE NIGHT
THERE WILL BE NO SHAME

CORUS:
WHEN IT'S COLD - WHEN IT'S COLD
OUTSIDE - OUTSIDE
AM I HERE IN VAIN
HOLD ON TO BE THE NIGHT
THERE WILL BE NO SHAME

CORUS
