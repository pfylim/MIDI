GLORIA ESTEFAN & THE MIAMI SOUNDMACHINE - I DON'T WANNA LOSE YOU

(Words & music: G. Estefan)

Sometimes it's hard, 
To make things clear
I know when to face the truth
And I know that moment is here

I'll open my heart
And show you inside
My love has no pride I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide

So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever (and ever)
Baby I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me I'll be around
Forever

We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay
It's all up to you
To tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know, and I know

That I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever (and ever)
'Cause baby I finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me I'll be around
Forever
