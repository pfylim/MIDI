Chants

O Eh, O Eh, O Eh Oo Aah
O Eh, O Eh, O Eh Oo Aah
Yah Yeh Goh

At night when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha

In bed, throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you

The rhythm is gonna get you
Tonight

No way you can fight it every day
But No matter what you say
You know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

No clue, of what's happening to you
And before this night is through
Ooh baby
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

Chants

Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you 
Tonight

Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na
Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na 

All chants
