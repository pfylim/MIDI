YEAH, OH
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD

SEEN THE SEAS SEVEN
SAILED ACROSS THEM ALL
SEEN THE MOON RISE OVER PARIS
AND I WATCHED HER GENTLY FALL

ON TO THE BEAT, KEEP MOVING
NEVER STOPPING, THOUGH SOMETIMES
I FEEL LIKE DROPPING
GOTTA KEEP ON AND BE STRONG
AVOID THE WRONG
COS IN THIS LIFE YOU WALK ALONE
THROUGH THE DANGER ZONE
UNTIL YOU GET HOME

BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, OH BABY
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, OH BABY

TAKE ME HOME
WHERE MY SOUL BELONGS

BEEN ABOVE THE CLOUDS
THAT PAINT THE SKY
STOOD BELOW THE COSMOS
AND I PONDERED ON A WAY

BACK TO THE TRACK IN FACT I'M BREAKING
THROUGH I NEVER KNEW THAT YOU WOULD
TURN AND WALK AWAY TO STAY
AND LEAVE ME STANDING ON MY OWN
FAR FROM ME, LIKE A NOMAD, SAD BAD

DREAMS ABOUT TOGETHERNESS
THAT WE NEVER HAD

BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THER'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, OH BABY
(GOTTA KEEP ON AND BE STRONG)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THER'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
(UNTIL YOU GET HOME)
OH BABY

TAKE ME HOME
WHERE MY SOUL BELONGS

SHOUT TO THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH
TO THE EAST TO THE WEST
TO THE HOME I LOVE BEST
WHERE MY SOUL CAN REST, YES

BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, OH BABY
(TO THE HOME I LOVE BEST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
(GOTTA BE STRONG AND KEEP ON)
OH BABY
(WHERE MY SOUL CAN REST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME, OH BABY
(TO THE HOME I LOVE BEST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
(GOTTA BE STRONG AND KEEP ON)
OH BABY
(WHERE MY SOUL CAN REST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD

(TO THE HOME I LOVE BEST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
YEAH
(TO THE HOME I LOVE BEST)
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
BUT THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
(GOTTA BE STRONG AND KEEP ON)
OH BABY
