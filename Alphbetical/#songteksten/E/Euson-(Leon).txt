Title  : LEON

Leon came along to see me on the road
Took the time to come back stage
And make himself known
And though we'd never been real close
As friends we'd shared some times
Worked the clubs once travelled music
Together for a while

Refrain:
Leon you've been away too long
The world ain't still the way it used to be
Leon you've been away too long
To turn your back now on your family

Tomorrow I'll be in Amsterdam
He smiled and shook my hand
Wished me all success and said
He'd tried to understand

But I envy you he said
And I tried to share his loss
Told him how the road was still
As tough as it was

My plane flew into Amsterdam
And lying in my room
I heard the news how Leon died
That very afternoon

I telephoned my flowers
With some words I hoped were kind
But our backstage conversation
Kept on coming to my mind

Refrain: ...
