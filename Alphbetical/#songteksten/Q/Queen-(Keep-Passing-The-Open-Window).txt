This is the only life for me
surround myself around my own fantasy
you just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
when you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
wake up screaming in the middle of the night
you think it's all been a waste of time
it's been a bad year.

You start believing everything's gonna be alright
next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
a brand new day is beginning
get that sunny feeling and you're on your way.

Just believe - just keep passing the open window
just believe - just keep passing the open window
do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
without a job and no money to spend 
you're a stranger.

All you think about is suicide
one of these days you're gonna lose the fight
you better keep out of danger - yeah
that same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
you keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
oh get yourself together.
Things are looking better everyday.

Just believe - keep passing the open windows
just believe - keep passing the open windows

This is the only life for me
surround myself around my own fantasy
you just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Love is all you need - baby - love is all you need.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.
