You never heard my song before the music was too loud
but now I think you hear me well for now we both know how
no star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
but some day, one day...

Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
a misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen.
Today the cloud hangs over us and all is grey
but some day, one day...

When I was you and you were me and we were very young
together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung
so still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
but some day, one day...
