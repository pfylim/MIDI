Don't touch me now
don't hold me now
don't break the spell darling, now you are near
look in my eyes
and speak to me
the special promises I want to hear
Las palabras de amor
let me hear the words of love
despacito mi amor
let me know, this night and evermore
this room is bare
this night is cold
we're far apart and I'm growing old
but while we live,
we'll meet again
so then my love we may whisper once more
it's you I adore
las palabras de amor
let me hear the words of love
despacito mi amor
touch me now
las palabras de amor
let us share the words of love
for evermore 
for evermore.
