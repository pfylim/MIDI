HEAVEN FOR EVERYONE - Queen

This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone.

In these days of cool reflection (reflection)
You come to me and everything seems all right
In these days of cold affection
You sit by me and everything's fine.

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one.

In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind.

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free
This world could be one
We should bring love
To our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, love
This could be heaven for everyone
You know.

This could be heaven for everyone, yeah
This could be heaven for everyone.

Listen, what people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity just drift at all
And show no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone.

This could be heaven
This could be heaven 
This could be heaven for everyone (could be heaven)
This could be heaven
Could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven 
This could be heaven
Could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven... 

For everyone
For everyone.
