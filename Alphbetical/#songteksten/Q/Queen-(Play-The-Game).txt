Open your mind and let me step inside.
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide.
It's so easy, when you know the rules.
It's so easy, all you have to do is to fall in love.

Play the game,
ev'rybody play the game
of love yeah.

When you're feelin' down and your resistance is low.
Light another cigarette and let yourself go.
This is your life,
don't play hard to get.
It's a free world, all you have to do ist to fall in love.

Play the game,
ev'rybody play the game
of love yeah.

My game of love has just begun.
Love runs from my head down to my toes.
My love is pumping thro' my veins.
Driving me insane.

Come, come, come,
play the game, play the game, play the game, play the game.

This is your life, don't play hard to get.
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love.
Play the game,
ev'rybody play the game
of love.

This is your life, don't play hard to get.
It's a free world, all you have to do is fall in love.
Play the game,
ev'rybody play the game
of love.
