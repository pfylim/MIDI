A word in your ear, from father to son
hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
long before you were born.

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
from father to son, to son...
and the voice is so clear, time after time it keeps
calling you, calling you on
don't destroy what you see, your country to be
just keep building on the ground that's been won.

Kings will be crowned, the word goes around
from father to son, to son
won't you hear us sing our family song
now we hand it on
but I've heard it all before.

Take this letter that I give you
take it sonny, hold it high
you won't understand a word that's in it
but you'll write it again before  you die.

A word in your ear, from father to son
funny you don't hear a single word I say
but my letter to you will stay by your side
through the years till the loneliness is gone
sing if you will - but the air you breath I live to give you.

Joyful the sound, the word goes around
from father to son, to son...

kings will be crowned, the word goes around
from father to son, to son.
