Title  : Radio Ga Ga
Singer : Queen


Radio, I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it through my radio
You gave them all, those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
Radio

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had your power
You yet to have your finest hour

Chorus:
All we hear is radio ga ga, radio go go, radio ga ga
Radio blah blah, radio, what's new ?
Radio someone still loves you
All we hear is radio ga ga, radio go go, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga, radio blah blah
Radio what's new? Someone still loves you
Radio ga ga (3x), radio
You had your time, you had your power
You yet to have your finest hour
Radio

We watch the stones, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all the good things, on you we depend
So stick around,'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

Chorus


Words & Music : Roger Taylor
