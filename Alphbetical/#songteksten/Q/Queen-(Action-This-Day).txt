Action
this street honey is a mean street
living in this street honey needs a mean streak
we've got criminals living in this sreet
but there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
like a jukebox playing tha same dead record
or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me.

This town honey is a dead town
living in this town honey is a let-down
coming to this town honey is a showdown
but there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
or a sight of a light at
the end of a tunnel
still there's a feeling, this world is using me
action this day
action this night
we've gotta learn to learn to live to love
you can't say it ain't right.

Action this day
action this night
you've got the power, you've got the power,
you've got the power to love and to live
you can't say it ain't right
your mind honey is a bleak place
living in your mind, living in a blank space
your mind is coming from a rat race
but there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
like a jukebox playing tha same dead record
or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me.

Action this day
action this night
we've gotta learn to learn to live, to love
we can't say it ain't right
action this day
action this night
you've got the power, you've got the power,
you've got the power to love, to live
you can't say it ain't right
action
action this day.
o you my soul.
