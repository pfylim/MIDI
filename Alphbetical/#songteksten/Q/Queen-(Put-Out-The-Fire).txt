They called him a hero
in the land of the free
but he wouldn't shake my hand boy
he disappointed me
so I got my handgun
and I blew him away
that critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay
you might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
look out baby it's the season
for the mad masquerade
put out the fire
you need a bullet like a hole in the head
put out the fire
don't believe what your grandaddy said
she was my lover
it was a shame that she died
but the constitution's right on my side
cos I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed
I got retribution, filled'em full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
to let me on the street again
it's nothing but a crime of passion
and I'm not to blame
put out the fire
you need a weapon like a hole in the head
put out the fire
and let your sons and your daughters
sleep sound in their beds
you know a gun never killed nobody
you can ask anyone
people get shot by people
people with guns
put out the fire
you need a gun like a hole in the head
put out the fire
just tell me that old fashioned gun law !!!!!
is dead.
