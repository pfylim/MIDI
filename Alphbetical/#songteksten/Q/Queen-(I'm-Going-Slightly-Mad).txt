When the outside temperature rises
and the meaning is oh so clear
one thousand and one yellow daffodils
begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
are they trying to tell you something ?
You're missing that one final screw
you're simply not in the pink my dear
to be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
it finally happened - happened
it finally happened - ooh oh
it finally happened - I'm slightly mad
oh dear !

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
one wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
this kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
it finally happened - happened
it finally happened - uh huh
it finally happened - I'm slightly mad
oh dear !

i'm knitting with only one needle
unravelling fast its true
I'm drivingonly three wheels these days

but my dear how about you ?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
it finally happened - happened
it finally happened - oh yes
it finally happened 
I'm slightly mad !
Just very slightly mad !
And there you have it !
