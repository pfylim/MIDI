Are you gonna take me home tonight ?
Ah, down beside that red fire light;
are you gonna let it all hang out ?
Fat bottomed girls, 
you make the rockin' world go round.
Hey !
I was just a skinny lad
never knew no good from bad.
But I knew life before
I left my nursery,
left alone with big fat Fanny,
she was such a naughty nanny.
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me.
Hey ! Hey !

I've been singing with my band across the wire,
across the land,
I seen ev'ry blueeyed floozy on the way.
But their beauty and their style went kind of
smooth after a while.
Take me to them dirty ladies ev'ry time.

Come on !
Oh, won't you take me home tonight ?
Oh, down beside your red firelight.
Oh, and you give it all you got fat bottomed girls.

You make the rockin' world go 'round.
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go 'round.

Hey listen here !

Now your mortages and homes,
and the stiffness in your bones.
Ain't no beauty queens in this locality.
Oh, but I still get my pleasure 
still got my greatest treasure.
Heap big woman you gonna make a big man out of me.

Come on !

Oh, you gonna take me home tonight.
Oh, down beside your red fire light. 
Oh, you gonna let it all hang out, 
fat bottomed girls.
You make the rockin' world go 'round.
Fat bottomed girls you make the rockin' world go 'round.

Get your bikes and ride !

Fat bottomed girls.
Fat bottomed girls.
