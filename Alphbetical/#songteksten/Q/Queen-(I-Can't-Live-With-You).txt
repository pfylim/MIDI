I can't live with you
but I can't live without you - 
I can't let you stay
but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
all I know is  I can't live with you
I'm having a hard time,
I'm walking a fine line
between hope and despair
you may think that I don't care - 
but I travelled a long road to
get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
but nothing's what it seems
love is saying baby it's all right
when deep inside you're really petrified
lover turns to hater
on this escalator
I can't live with you
but I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
but I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
all I know is  I can't live without you
we're stuck in a bad polace
we're trapped in a rat race
and we can't escape
maybe there's been some mistake
we're trying to make a high score
we're walking through a closed door
and nobody's winning - 
we're just sinning against ourselves
hold on baby tell me it's all right
anger's breaking from the hurt inside
passions screaming hotter
doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you,
I can't live with you 
I can't live, I can't live,
I can't, I can't live with you
but baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
but I can't live without you - 
cause I'm in love with you
and everything about you
I can't live with you
no I just can't live, I just can't live,
I can't live with you,
and I can't live without you
through the madness, through the tears
we've still got each other
for a million years
