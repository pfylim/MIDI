Let me show it to you
see what I got
I got a hell of a lot
tell me what you feel
is it real
is it real
you know I got what it takes
and I can take a lot
did you hear the last call baby
you and me got staying power
you and me we got staying power
staying power I got it, I got it
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wonder when we're gonna shake it
rock me baby rock me
c'mon you can shock me
let's catch on to the groove
make it move, make it  move
you know how to shake that thing
we'll work it, work it, work it
you and I can play ball baby
you and me got staying power
you and me we got staying power
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wonder when we're gonna shake it
I've got fire down below
I'm just a regular dynamo
want some smooth company
don't lose control just hang on out with me
got to get to know each other
but we got plenty of time
did you hear the last call baby
you and me got staying power
you and me we got staying power
power
I wonder where we're gonna stick it
I wonder when we're gonna trick it
blow baby blow
let's get down and go go
get yourself in the mood
got to give a little bit of attitude
baby don't you crash
let's just trash trash trash
did you hear the last call baby
you and me got staying power
you and me we got staying power
staying power...got'cha.
