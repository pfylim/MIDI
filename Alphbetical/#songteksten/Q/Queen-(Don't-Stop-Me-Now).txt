---------------------------------------------------------------------

Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time.
I feel alive, and the world turning inside out, yeah,
and floating around in ecstasy.
So don't stop me now.
Don't stop me 'cause I'm havin' a good time,
havin' a good time.
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky,
like a tiger, defying the laws of gravity.
I'm a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva.
I'm gonna go, go, go.
There's no stopin' me.

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah. 
Two hundred degrees, 
that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light.
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.
Don't stop me now,
I'm havin' such a good time,
I'm havin' a ball.
Don't stop me now, if you wanna have a good time,
just give me a call.
Don't stop me now.
Don't stop me now.
I don't want to stop at all.

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars, 
on a collision course.
I am a satelite, I'm out of control,
I'm a sex maschine, redy to reload,
like an atombomb, about to
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode.
I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah. 
Two hundred degrees, 
that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light.
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.
Don't stop me, 
don't stop me, 
don't stop me, 
don't stop me, 
don't stop me, 
ooh, ooh, ooh,
don't stop me,
don't stop me,
have a good time, good time.
Don't stop me now, don't stop me

Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time.
I feel alive, and the world turning inside out, yeah,
and floating around in ecstasy.
So don't stop me now.
Don't stop me 'cause I'm havin' a good time,
havin' a good time.

I'm burnin' through the sky, yeah. 
Two hundred degrees, 
that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit.
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light.
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you.
Don't stop me now,
I'm havin' such a good time,
I'm havin' a ball.
Don't stop me now, if you wanna have a good time,
just give me a call.
'Cause I'm havin' a good time,
yes I'm having a good time.
I don't want to stop at all.
