Are you ready ? - Well are you ready ?

Give me your mind baby give me your body
give me some time baby let's have a party
it ain't no time for sleepin' baby
soon it's round your street I'm creeping
-you better be ready-

We gonna tear it up
         stir it up
         break it up - baby -

You gotta tear it up
          shake it up
          make it up - as you go along.

          Tear it up
          Square it up
          Wake it up - baby -

          Tear it up
          Stir it up
          Stake it out - and you can't go wrong.

(Hey)

I love you cos you're sweet and I love you cos you're naughty
I love you for your mind but give me your body
I wanna be a toy at your birthday party
wind me up - wind me up - wind me up - let me go -

          Tear it up
          Stir it up
          Break it up - baby -

          Tear it up
          Shake it up
          Make it up - as you go along.

          Turn it up
          Burn it up-

Baby baby baby are you ready for me ? (Oh yeah)
Baby baby baby are you ready for love ? (Oh yeah)
Are you ready - are you ready - are you ready for me ? (Oh yeah)
