Steve walks warily down the street
with the brim pulled way down low.
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet:
machine guns ready to go.
Are you ready, hey !
Are you ready for this ?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat ?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
to the sound of the beat.

Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
And anotherone gone, and anotherone gone.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Hey ! I'm gonna get you too.
Anotherone bites the dust.

How do you think I'm going to get along 
without you, when you're gone ?
You took me for e'vry thing that I had
and kicked me out on my own.
Are you happy ?
Are you satisfied ?
How long can you stand the heat ?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
to the sound of the beat.

Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
And anotherone gone, and anotherone gone.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Hey ! I'm gonna get you too.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man,
and bring him to the ground.
You can beat him you can cheat him you can treat him bad
and leave him when he's down.
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you.
I'm standing on my own two feet.
Out of the doorway the bullets rip,
repeating the sound of the beat.

Anotherone bites the dust.
Anotherone bites the dust.
And anotherone gone, and anotherone gone.
Anotherone bites the dust.
Hey ! I'm gonna get you too.
Anotherone bites the dust.
