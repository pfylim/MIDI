And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
and you're rushing headlong out of control
and you think you're so strong
but there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
you can do about it
there's nothin' you can do
no there's nothin' you can do about it
no there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can,
nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
and you're rushing headlong out of control
and you think you're so strong
but there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
you can do about it.

He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
now you've got soup in the laundry bag
now you've got strings, you're gonna loose your rag
you're gettin' in a fight
then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
let me out of this cheap 'B' movie
headlong down the highway and you're rushing
headlong out of control
and you think you're so strong
but there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
and there's nothin' you can,
nothin' you can, nothin' you can do about it.

When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
hoop diddy diddy - hoop diddy do
soon the fire starts a raging get's 'em more than half crazy
they start walking cause your feet got burned
it ain't no time to figure wrong from right
cause reason's out the window
better hold on tight - you're rushin' ... etc.
