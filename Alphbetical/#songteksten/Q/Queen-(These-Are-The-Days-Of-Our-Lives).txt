Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
when we were kids, when we were young
things seemed so perfect - you know ?
The days were endles, we were crazy - we were young
the sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
the rst of my life's been - jus a show.
Those were the days of our lives
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one thing is true -
when I look and I find I still love you
you can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
ain't that a shame ?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
when life was just a game
no use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
when you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
better sit back and go - with the flow
cos these are the days of our lives
they've flown in the swiftness of time
these days are all gone now but some things remain
when I look and I find - no change
those were the days of our lives yeah
the bad things in life were so few
those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
when I look and I find, I still love you,
I still love you
