Title  : IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ME LOVE

(Words & music: Chinn/Chapman)

Well I've seen you before
On that discotheque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
Oh but I could've sworn that I saw
Something more in your eyes

Oh though you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
Your glances intended for me
And though I tried to hide it
I found myself looking to see

So then you took your changes
You made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello, are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say

Chorus:
If you can't give me love
Honey that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself
If you can't give me love (5x)

Well you may be the king of this discotheque
But honey I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man, not some sort of aristocrat
Oh if only you'd wanted or just hesitated
Or maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know why I don't want to go baby
That's why we don't stand a chance

Chorus: ...
