Titel:             THE FAIRY FELLER'S MASTER-STROKE

Interpret/Text:    QUEEN

---------------------------------------------------------------------


He's a fairy feller
the fairy folk have gathered round the new-moon shine
to see the feller crack a nut at night's noon-time
to swing his axe he swears, as it climbs he dares
to deliver...
the master-stroke.

Ploughman, "waggoner will", and types
politician with senatorial pipe - he's a dilly-dally-o
pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
and a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
what a dirty laddio
tatterdemalion and a junketer
there's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter -
he's my hero
fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
the nymph in yellow "can we see the master-stroke"
what aquaere fellow.

Soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
waiting to hear the sound
and the arch-magician presides
he is the leader
oberon and titania watched by a harridan
mab is the Queen and there's a good
apothecary-man
come to say hello
fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
the nymph in yellow
what a quaere fellow
the ostler stares with hands on his knees
come on Mr. Feller, crack it open if you please.
