There's no living in my life anymore
the seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore
can't you see
listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
don't send me to the path of nevermore.

Even the valleys below
where the rays of sun were so warm and tender
now haven't anything to grow
can't you see
why did you have to leave me
why did you decieve me
you send me to the path of nevermore
when you say you didn't love me anymore
nevermore
nevermore.
