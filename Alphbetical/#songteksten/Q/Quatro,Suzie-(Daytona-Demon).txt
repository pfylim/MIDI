Title  : DAYTONA DEMON

Ride me, ride me, we do anything we wanna do
Speed you, speed me, you're my machine
(Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon)
Ride up, ride down let your motor make me heaven bound
Hang in, hang on turn me on

(Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon)
He's my Daytona Demon, he's my supped up heavy hung heman
He's my Daytona Demon, my machine
He's my Daytona Demon, he's my fast loving sin
soaked heathen
He's my Daytona Demon, my machine

Feel good, feel free, and I know he'll always feel like me
Drive fast, drive hard drive with me
(Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon)
They love, to see, my demon when she's driving me
Like a man made machine, he's so mean

(Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon Daytona Demon)
He's my Daytona Demon, he's my supped up heavy hung heman
He's my Daytona Demon, my machine
He's my Daytona Demon, he's my fast loving sin
soaked heathen
He's my Daytona Demon, my machine

My my my my Daytona Demon Daytona Demon
