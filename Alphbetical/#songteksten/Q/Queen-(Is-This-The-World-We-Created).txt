Just think of all those hungry mouth we have to feed
take a look at all the suffering we breed
so many lonely faces scattered all around
searching for what they need.

Is this the world we created
what did we do it for
is this the world we invaded
against the law
so it seems in the end
is this what we're all living for today
the world that we created.

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
who need some loving care inside a happy home
somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
waiting for life to go by.

Is this the world we created, we made it on our own.
is this the world we devastated, right to the bone
if there's a God in the sky looking down
what can he think of what we've done
to the world that we created.
