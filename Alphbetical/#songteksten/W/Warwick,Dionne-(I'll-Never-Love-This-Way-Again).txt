Title  : I'LL NEVER LOVE THIS WAY AGAIN

(Words & music: R. Kerr/W. Jennings)

You looked inside my fantasies and made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the mem'ries one by one, since you took me in
And I know I'll never love this way again

Chorus:
I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow, reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow if you should go away
I'll stand here and remember just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

Chorus: ...2x...
