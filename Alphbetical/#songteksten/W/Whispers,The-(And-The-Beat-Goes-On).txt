Title  : AND THE BEAT GOES ON

(Words & music: ?)

Chorus:
And the beat goes on
Just like my love everlasting
And the beat goes on
Still moving strong, on and on

Do you ever wonder
That to win somebody's got to lose
I might as wellget over the blues
Just like fishing in the ocean
There'll always be someone new
Who'll have a bad time
Just leave me alone
'Cos I've been through stormy weather

Chorus: ...

Don't stop for nobody
This time I keep my feet on solid ground
Now I understand myself when I'm down
Like the sweet sound of hip music
There'll always be something new
To keep the tables turning
To fit the song
But there'll never be an ending

Chorus: ...

The beat goes on
The beat goes on
The beat goes on

Get down babe, now feel
You're sure the beat is real
The beat goes on

Chorus: ...
