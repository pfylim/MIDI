Singer : CLIFFORD T. WARD 
Title  : JIGSAW GIRL

There's nothing left for me to do
But sit around and wait for you
And hope you find the time to put me in the picture
But when I look at you
You've always got somebody new
And though you say you're mine
You treat me like a fixture
It seems that I'm around to pick up all the pieces
And when at last they're found
Sort them out again

Refrain:
You're a jigsaw girl, jigsaw girl, jigsaw girl
No sooner we're together than you go and break us
up again
And so we never will remain

Places where you wind up in
Are not the sort where I fit in
And though you know I've tried to see
your point of view
To you I'm just a game to make an effort to
Or shall I have to take this puzzle apart
But that would only break my heart

Refrain: ...
