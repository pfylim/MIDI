KIM WILDE - NEVER TRUST A STRANGER

(Words & music: R. Wilde/K. Wilde)

I knew there was a danger
But couldn't resist
The touch of a stranger
The thrill of his kiss
'Cause this time
I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Refrain:
Woh never trust a stranger
With your heart
Oh no never trust a stranger
With your heart

My world is in pieces
You've stolen my pride
And I'm left defeated
And crushed by your lies

I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Refrain: ...

Like a tiger you hunted and tracked me down
Savaged my soul and took over control
And then when you'd used all the love you found
You left without trace not a not or a single goodbye

I thought it was love
I thought it was heaven
Having the time of my life
I know it's not true

Refrain: ...

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
