WOMACK & WOMACK - TEARDROPS (LP VERSION)


Whenever I hear goodbyes, (Reminds me baby of you)
I break down and cry, (Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Fever for lost romance, (Reminds me baby of you)
I took a crazy chance, (The next time I'll be true
I'll be true, I'll be true)

Footsteps on the dance floor, (Reminds me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes, (Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel
Ever feels like I felt it with you

(solo)

When I'm dancin' 'round, (Reminds me baby of you)
I really let you down, (Next time I'll be true, yeah)
I took a crazy chance, (She cries on every tune)
Every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor, (Reminds me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes, (Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel
Ever feels like I felt it with you

(solo)

Hurting deep inside
(She cries on every tune)
I'll break down and cry
(She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune)

Footsteps on the dance floor, (Reminds me baby of you)
Teardrops in my eyes, (Next time I'll be true, yeah)
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune
Every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel
Ever feels like I felt it with you

And the music don't feel like it did
When I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel
Ever feels like I felt it with you

Fever for lost romance, (Reminds me baby of you)
I took a crazy chance, (The next time I'll be true
I'll be true, I'll be true)
