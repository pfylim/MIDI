Title  : I LOVE YOU BABY

As I walk by the seaside
As I walk through the grass
I see little bluebirds making love while I pass
Bees are humming and there's singing every where
Everyone's in love

Oh oh oh oh I love you baby
I love you so
I need you honey
I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I love you

As I walk by the schoolyard
As I walk by the gate
I see the weeping willow where we kissed on every date
And carved in the bark you'll find an arrow and a heart
And underneath it says

Oh oh oh oh I love you baby
I love you so
I need you honey
I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I love you

As I walk to the corner
And I pass a candy store
I hear the every music that I once heard before
Oh, how you held me as the music softly played
I was so in love

Oh oh oh oh I love you baby
I love you so
I need you honey
I'll never let you go
'Cause you're the girl in my life
You're the one I adore
And I love you
