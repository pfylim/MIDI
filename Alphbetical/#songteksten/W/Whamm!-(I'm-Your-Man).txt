WHAM! - I'M YOUR MAN

Oh, call me good, call me bad
Call me anything you want to baby
But I know ah ha that you're sad
And I know I'll make you happy
With the one thing that you never had
Baby I'm your man
Don't you know that baby I'm your man
You bet

If you're gonna do it
Do it right (right) do it with me (3x)

So good you're divine
Wanna take you wanna make you
But they tell me it's a crime oh
Everybody knows where the good people go
But where you're going baby
Ain't no such word as no

Baby I'm your man
Don't you know who I am baby I'm your man
You bet

If you're gonna do it
Do it right (right) do it with me (2x)

If you're gonna do it
Do it right (right) do it all night

First class information
Sexual inspiration
With some simulation
We can do it right oh oh oh oh oh

So why waste time with the other guys
When you can have mine I ain't asking for no sacrifice
Baby your friends do not need to know
I got a real nice place to go
Listen I don't need you to care
I don't need you to understand yeah
All I want is for you to be there
And when I'm turned on
I'm your man (I'm your man)

If you're gonna do it
Do it right (right) do it with me (3x)

Now listen if you're gonna do it
You know I say, if you're gonna do it
Don't throw it away
Don't throw it baby
Because I'll be your boy, I'll be your man
I'll be the one who understands
I'll be the only one you ask
I'll be your friend I'll be your toy
I'll be the one who brings you joy
I'll be your hope I'll be your pearl
I'll take you half way round the world

I'll make you rich I'll make you poor
Just don't use the door

If you're gonna do it
Do it right (right) do it with me
