Title  : WE'RE ALL ALONE

(Words & music: Boz Scaggs)

Outside the rain begins
And it may never end
So cry no more on the shore
A dream, will take us out to sea
Forever more, forever more
Close your eyes and dream
And you can be with me
'Neath the waves thru the caves of hours
Long forgotten now
We're all alone, we're all alone

Chorus:
Close the window, calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend

Once a story's told
It can't help but grow old
Roses do, lovers too
So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh hold me dear

Chorus: ...

Close the window, calm the light
And it will be alright
No need to bother now
Let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, all alone
Let it out, let it all begin
Throw it to the wind
My love we're all alone
