Title  : (I've Had) The Time Of My Live
Singer : Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes


Now I've had the time of my life
No I never felt like this before
Yes I swear it's the truth
and I owe it all to you
'Cause I've had the time of my life
and I owe it all to you

I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone
To stand by me
We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical
Fantasy

Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it
Secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand
The urgency just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough
So I'll tell you something
This clould be love because

CHORUS:
I've had the time of my life
No I never felt this way before
Yes I swear it's the truth
And I owe it all to you

With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control
Yes I know what's on your mind
When your say, "Stay with me tonight." 
Just remember

You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something
This could be love because

CHORUS

'Cause I had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I've found the truth
and I owe it all to you

CHORUS
