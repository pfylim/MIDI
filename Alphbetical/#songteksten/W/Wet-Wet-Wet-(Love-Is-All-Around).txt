
8. LOVE IS ALL AROUND - WET WET WET

I FEEL IT IN MY FINGERS
I FEEL IT IN MY TOES
THE LOVE THAT'S ALL AROUND ME
AND SO THE FEELING GROWS

IT'S WRITTEN ON THE WIND
IT'S EV'RYWHERE I GO
SO IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME
COME ON AND LET IT SHOW
OOH

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
I ALWAYS WILL
MY MIND'S MADE UP
BY THE WAY THAT I FEEL
THERE'S NO BEGINNING
THERE'LL BE NO END
'CAUSE ON MY LOVE
YOU CAN DEPEND

(INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE)

I SEE YOUR FACE BEFORE ME
AS I LAY ON MY BED
I CANNOT GET TO THINKING
OF ALL THE THINGS YOU SAID
(OH YES I THINK)

YOU GAVE YOUR PROMISE TO ME
AND I GAVE MINE TO YOU
I NEED SOMEONE BESIDE ME
IN EVERYTHING I DO
(OOH I DO)

YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU
I ALWAYS WILL
MY MIND'S MADE UP
BY THE WAY THAT I FEEL
THERE'S NO BEGINNING
THERE'LL BE NO END
'CAUSE ON MY LOVE
YOU CAN DEPEND

IT'S WRITTEN IN THE WIND
OH EV'RYWHERE I GO
SO IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME
COME ON AND LET IT SHOW
COME ON AND LET IT SHOW
COME ON AND LET IT
COME ON AND LET IT
COME ON AND LET IT SHOW
COME ON AND LET IT
COME ON AND LET IT
COME ON AND LET IT SHOW
(REPEAT AND FADE OUT)
