WET WET WET - ANGEL EYES

Ooh, oohoo

Sick of leaving in the morning
With the night you gave away, ahhh
So now I'm gonna take out all that I can get
With those angel eyes, you make saints
do sins all the ti-ie-a-ie-me
Say I'm gonna stay, home and away
well, well

When I said I'd catch you when you're falling
I'd have my heart open wide
And you who's not naive I thou-ou-ought
So I thought I'd mend my heart

refrain:
People say, I'm so automatic
Ah people say I'm not so systematic
But when I'm down I'm in manual Lord
Time and time again I walk on by
With the looks of love
And with those angel eyes oh ooh oho
You set me on fire baby
And with those angel eyes oh ooh oho

Don't want nothing else

The saddest thing I've ever seen on my TV screen
Was a dying man, who died for his team
The toughest thing I've ever heard
Was the newborn scream in this naked world

refrain:

C'mon now baby

Say I'm gonna stay, home and away
Show a little loving that'll make you smile girl
Say I'm gonna stay, home and away

People say, I'm so automatic
Ah people say I'm not so systematic
But when I'm down I'm in manual Lord
Been all around those edges
But ain't never been in love oh
Ain't never been in love, before babe
Never been in love
(And with those angel eyes)
Never been in love
You set me on fire baby
(And with those angel eyes) oh oh 
You set me on fire fire
(And with those angel eyes) oh oh
Set me on fire fire
