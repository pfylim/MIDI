(Words & music: A. West/J. Muso)

Listen to my problems girl
And help me if you can
Come to me for ever more
Please try to understand
You're the sun that shines at night
And I'm searching for that light
Oho, I love you, will you love me too

You're the one who makes me smile
In my dreams every night
Oh you should know what I feel inside
Is there something I can do to let you appear
Oh how I try to have you near, yeah

Listen to my problems girl
And help me if you can
Take a trip from out of my dreams
I will wait with a band
They'll play for you rock and roll
So you know where to go
Oho, please little girl will you come to me

Listen to my problems girl
And help me if you can
Come to me for ever more
Please try to understand
You're the sun that shines at night
And I'm searching for that light
Oho, I love you, will you love me too
