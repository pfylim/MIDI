NARADA MICHAEL WALDEN - GIMME GIMME GIMME

On the road, travellin' with my band
I was so exhausted from one night stands
Caught your smile and you threw me some heat
Well, I like your style it was strong but sweet
I fell for you right then and there
I didn't care who knew, I'd follow you anywhere

Refrain:
Gimme gimme gimme all night long
Gimme gimme gimme keep playing that love song
Gimme gimme gimme all night long
Gimme gimme gimme gimme that love song

When we met, I had been alone
And I was more than ready to live on my own
Then your song touched me deep inside
Until you came along I wasn't satisfied

Fell for you right then and there
I didn't care who knew I didn't follow
you anywhere

Refrain: ...
