7. MISS SAIGON (SUN & MOON) - GRACE WILSON & ANTHONY LLEWELLYN

You're sunlight and I moon
Joined by the Gods of fortune
Midnight and tie moon
Sharing the sky
We have been blessed you and I
You are here like a mystery
I'm from a world that's so different
from all that you are
How will the light of one night lead behind so far
Outside day starts to dawn
Your moon still floats on high
The birds awake
The stars shine too
My hands still shake
I reach for you
And we met in the sky
Joint till brightin' the sky
With the flame of love
made of sunlight moonlight
