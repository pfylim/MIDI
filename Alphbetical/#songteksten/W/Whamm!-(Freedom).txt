WHAM! - FREEDOM

Everyday I hear a different story
People saying that you're no good for me
Saw your lover with another
She's making a fool of you, oh
If you loved me baby you'd deny it
But you laugh and tell me I should try it
Tell me I'm a baby and I don't understand
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do

Refrain:
I don't want your freedom
I don't want to play around
I don't want nobody baby
Part time love just brings me down
I don't need your freedom
Girl all I want right now is you

Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day
Knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool
To give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby
Someone says the same to you
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you do oh

Refrain: ...

Can't you see you're hurting me
You're hurting me baby hurting me baby
You're hurting me baby hurting me baby
But you know that I'll forgive you
Just this once twice forever
'Cause baby you could drag me to hell and back
Just as long as we're together
And you oh

Refrain: ...(2x)...

I don't want your (8x)
