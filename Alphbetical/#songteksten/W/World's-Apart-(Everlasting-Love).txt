
5. Everlasting Love - World's Apart

Hearts go astray
Leaving hearts when they go
You went away
Just when I needed you so
Finding your way
You came back wanting me
I'm going to stay
Loving you endlessly
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realise
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
Everlasting love
Oh yeah my everlasting love
Look in my eyes
See my love burning strong
No more goodbyes
In your arms I belong
Baby now our time has come
All my dreams have come true
Two hearts as one
Loving me loving you
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realise
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never been denied

Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Realise the power of everlasting love
Oh yeah my everlasting love
This love will last forever
You are my everlasting love
You are my everlasting love
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realise
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side
There's no need to hide
Never be denied
(REPEAT)
