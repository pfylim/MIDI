Title  : CRY TO ME
Artist : PRECIOUS WILSON

(Words & music: Burt Russel)

When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Come on cry to me

When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there is nothing but the smell of her perfume
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Come on cry to me

Nothing can be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Lonelyless such a long time
And there's no need for you to ever walk alone
So come on, come on cry to me

When you're all alone waiting for her voice
In the night, but it doesn't come
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Don't you feel like crying
Come on cry to me
