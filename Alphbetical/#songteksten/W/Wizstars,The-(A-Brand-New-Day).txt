Singer : THE WIZSTARS
Title  : A BRAND NEW DAY

(Words & music: Luther Vandross)

Ev'rybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice, you see
Ev'rybody come out
And let's commence to sing joyfully
Ev'rybody look up
And feel the hope that we'd been waiting on
Ev'rybody's glad
Because our silent fear and dread is gone

Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out

Chorus:
Can't you feel a brand new day
Can you feel a brand new day
Can't you feel a brand new day
Can you feel a brand new day

Ev'rybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Ev'rybody wake up
Into the mornin to happiness
Hello world
It's like a dif'rent way of living now
Thank you world!
We always knew that we'd be free somehow

In harmony
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out

Chorus: ...
