I'm glad you're home
and I'll bet you really missed me.
I guess you did by the look in your eye
lay back and relax
and I'll put away the dishes and you and me can rockabye.

You can ring my bell, ring my bell.
You can ring my bell, ring my bell.
You can ring my bell, ring my bell.
You can ring my bell, ring my bell.

The night is young
and full of possibilities,
well, come on and let yourself be free.
Now my love for you
so long I've been saving, the night was made for me and you.

You can ring my bell,...
