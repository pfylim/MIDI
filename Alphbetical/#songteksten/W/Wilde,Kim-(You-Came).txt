KIM WILDE - YOU CAME

(Words & music: R. Wilde/K. Wilde)

Someone I know is staring at me
And when I look into her eyes
I see a girl that I used to be
I hardly recognize
Cos in the space of a year
I've watched the old me disappear
All of the things I once held precious
Just don't mean anything anymore
Cos suddenly

Refrain:
You came, and changed the way I feel
No one could love you more
Because you came and turned my life around
No one could take your place

I've never felt good with permanent things
Now I don't want anything to change
You can't imagine the joy you bring
My life wont be the same
And I'll be there you call
I'll pick you up if you should fall
Cos I have never felt such inspiration
Nobody else ever gave me more because

Refrain: ...

I watch you sleep in the still of the night
You look so pretty when you dream
So many people just go through life
Holding back, they don't say what they mean
But it's easy for me
Since you came
