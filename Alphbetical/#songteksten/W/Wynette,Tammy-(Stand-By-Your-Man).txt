     Stand by your man           Tammy Wynette


Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man.
You'll have bad times
And he'll have good times,
Doin' things that you don't understand.

But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though it's hard to understand.
And if you love him,
Oh, be proud of him
'couse after all he's just a man.

Stand vy your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And sometihing warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely.


Stand by your man
And tell the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can.

Stand by your man, stand by your man
And show the world you love him.
Keep giving all the love you can.

Stand by your man.
