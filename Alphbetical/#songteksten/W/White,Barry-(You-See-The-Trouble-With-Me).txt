Singer : BARRY WHITE 
Title  : YOU SEE THE TROUBLE WITH ME

I'm like a blind man who lost his way
I can't see nothing
I'm like a deaf man who can't relate
And I can hear nothing

See the trouble with me
I can do nothing without my baby
And it's plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy

I walk the lonely streets late at night
Cold and lonely
Ev'rything I do is wrong, never right
I'm longing for her only

See the trouble with me
I can do nothing without my baby
And it's plain as can be
It's gonna drive me crazy
