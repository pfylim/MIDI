(Words & music: Paul McCartney)

Don't say goodnight for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It may never be the same again

Chorus:
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
Say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight
Don't say it, don't say it
You can say anything, but don't say goodnight tonight

Chorus: ...

Don't get too tired for love
Don't let it end
Don't say goodnight to love
It's a feeling that may never end

Chorus: ...
