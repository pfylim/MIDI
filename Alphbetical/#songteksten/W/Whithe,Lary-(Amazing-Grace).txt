Amazing grace how sweet the sound
that safed a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found 
was blind  but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fear relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
the hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils and snares
we have already come.
'Twas grace that brought us safe thus far,
and grace will lead us home.
