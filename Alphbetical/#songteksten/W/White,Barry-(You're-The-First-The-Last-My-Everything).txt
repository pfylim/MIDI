Singer : BARRY WHITE 
Title  : YOU'RE THE FIRST, THE LAST, MY EVERYTHING

(spoken)
We got it together, didn't we
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together babe

The first, my last, my ev'rything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're the sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are

I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're, you're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep forever more
You're the first, you're the last, my everything

In you I find so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see if you,
You make me feel this way
You're like a fresh morning dew
Or a brand new day

I see so many ways that I
Can love you till the day I die
You're my reality
Yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything
