5. JULIA SAYS - WET WET WET

Here we go again thru the backstreets of my mind,
It seems my life was standing still,
Who's sorry now, It's funny how I didn't know it

Here we go again
Fighting things we never win,
It seems our love was standing still
I'm sorry now.
It's funny now I don't feel the love,
I just hear the words, Julia says.

She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your heart and see
Love hurts.

I won't be fooled again,
Looking for the dreams I couldn't find
The dreams for me were left behind
I'm sorry now, It's funny now, 
I don't feel the love, 
I just hear the love, Julia says.

She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't seem to care at all
Open your heart and see love hurts,
Julia please, open your eyes and see.

Julia wants to be on her own
Sharing her thoughts, she's all alone,
Dreaming of the things
She wants to be,
Where Julia don't belong

Julia said
She doesn't know what it's all about
She doesn't know, C'mon Julia
She doesn't know what it's all about
Julia...
