10. FREEDOM 96 - ROBBIE WILLIAMS

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in my self
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
`Cause I would really, really love 
To stick around stick around

Heaven knows I was such a young boy
I didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's
Pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game
Is got to change
Oh yeah
And I'm gonna get me some happy

I think there's something
You should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Somehow the clothes do not make the man

Refrain
All we have to do now
Is take these lies
And make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah
Freedom 
I won`t let you down
Freedom
I Will not give you up
Freedom
Got some faith in my self
It's the one good thing that I've 
Freedom 
I won`t let you down
Freedom
Please don`t give me up
Freedom
`Cause I would really, really love 
To stick around stick around

Heaven knows we sure had some fun boy
What a kick just my buddies and me
We won the race
Got out the place
Went back home got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
Today the way I play the game
Has got to change
Oh yeah
And I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something
You should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you`ll understand 
Sometimes the clothes
Do not make the man

Refrain

Freedom 
I won`t let you down

Got some faith in my self
It's the one good thing that I've 
Freedom 
I won`t let you down
