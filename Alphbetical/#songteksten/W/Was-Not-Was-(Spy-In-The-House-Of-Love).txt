WAS NOT WAS - SPY IN THE HOUSE OF LOVE

Ooh ah ah yeah I'm a spy in the house of love
(Spy in the house of love)
I don't know what I'm gonna do this evening
(Spy in the house of love)

The air was filled with suspicion
She poured us two Martinis
And tried to guess my mission
I pretended to know nothing especially indiscretion
But she turned those floodlit eyes on me
And demanded a confession I told her

Refrain:
I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused I'm waiting for your heart's defection

(Spy) oh oh yeah (in the house of love)
Look a here

I saw yes I did everything that pleased her
I recorded every movement and plotted how to seize her
I used a tiny camera I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her and sat around and squeezed her
I told her

Refrain: ...

I'll read your mail (I'll read your mail)
I'll tap your phone (I'll tap your phone)
I'm on your trail you're never alone
One day you'll slip up
And leave a lip print on a coffee cup
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ah yeah

I'm a spy yeah but I just can't help myself
(Spy in the house of love)
(Spy) oh baby (in the house of love)
I used a tiny camera I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her and sat around and squeezed her

Refrain: ...
