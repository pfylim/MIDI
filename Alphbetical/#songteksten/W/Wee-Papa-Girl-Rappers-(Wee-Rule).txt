In a brand new fashion
In a dance hall style wee rule
Praise the nation don't delay

The bass drum is hitting
Out a hardcore beat
Don't bother even moving
Stay right in your seat
The captivating
Mike controller
Elevating your act
Je suis TY Tim now how do you like that
With my ball point pen
I write out my show
Drive around in a taxi
Every place that I go
Eat neat got a seat
'Cause they know me every town
And my sexy reputation
Won't let me down

Refrain: ...

Play da ridim for me again rasta
Because dat de ridim de maca
Def ears on the floor
Give me what you got
Total S my controller
I'm taking this hot
You say I give away
My tales no grieve
Why do you try to run the heat
On me cause one of those days
You're hitting hard shell
We're gonna take you from here to hell
Outside you'll freeze
You'll remember this heat
You tell all those lies
And why do you cheat
We just take the best
Don't ask a dilemma
This isn't a game
It just gets better
Words we show you
Yeah we show you
That it's no good
And if you can't take that
You can kiss my boot

Refrain: ...

Come no come no come no oh
I saw you sleeping on a station
On a dredgy wood bench
I say you turn away embarrassed
Started swearing in French
Fou le camp you started saying
But you just didn't know
That I passed exams in French
About one year ago
And this beat this beat
This beat is mine
And this beat this beat
This beat is mine
