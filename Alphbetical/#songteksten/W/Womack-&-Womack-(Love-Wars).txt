WOMACK & WOMACK - LOVE WARS

Refrain:
Love wars
Love wars
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
But it's taking me under
Since you're not here

Better when it's hard to get
But this hide and seek
Is makin' me weak
Promised to stop boxing you round
So don't scratch my face
End of round eight

Refrain: ...

We need to get our act together
Take it off the street
Bring it on home
And drop the guns on the floor
And stop these love wars love wars
The make love for peace
In the name of never cheat
To be strong and let the band roll on
And stop these love wars

Talks we have don't mean a thing
They only bring rain
On top of pain
Flash-backs and uncovered tracks
From when you left
With my best friend

Refrain: ...

Love bombs exploding air
Who threw the last one
I didn't care
I remember losin' my head
And calling you things
Like dirty names
