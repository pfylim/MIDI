Title  : I LIKE YOUR STYLE

(Words & music: Tony Wilson)

I know why, I like your style
I know why, I like your style

I've learned my lesson, you taught me well
How I feel, only I can tell
You're doing me things I've never known
You know the way to love me, take me home

I know why, I like your style
I know why, I just love your style

It's not just chance, some things you see
Are meant to happen, just got to be
A love like yours was meant for me
The way your love is how love should be

I know why, I like your style
I know why, I like your style

I've learned my lesson, you taught me well
How I feel, only I can tell
You're doing me things like I want you to do
Giving it to me like I never knew

I know why, I like your style
I know why, I like your style
