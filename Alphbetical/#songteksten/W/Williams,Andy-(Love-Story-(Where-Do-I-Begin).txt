LOVE STORY (WHERE DO I BEGIN)



Where do I begin 
To tell the story of how great a lovw can be, 
he sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me?
Where do I start?
With her first hallo
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine:
There'd never be another love, another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart.

She fills my heart with very special things
With angel songs with wild imaginings
She fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go I'm never lonely
With her along who could be lonely?
I reach for her hand, it's always there.

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in the day?
I have no answer now, but this much I can say:
I know I'll need her till the stars all burn a way
And she'll be there.
