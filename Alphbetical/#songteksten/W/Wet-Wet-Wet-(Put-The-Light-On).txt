He sits alone in a crowded station
and lights his cigarette
the light flickers slightly
and tells him politely
his life's not at its best

She weighs him up 'cos his love's taken lightly
and love's her only regret
but love's not a sin in her eyes
and she's asking him why -

Why are you leaving
I just cant say
Why are you leaving
He don't know daddy's gonna stay

Put a little light in her darkest day
so she can see it
put a little love in her heart on the way
so she can feel it

He walks home with his pride in his pocket
and pulls it out with his change
and his love is something and it just turned to nothing
now isn't that strange

She holds her head high close to a bright sky
he's got his head in the cloud
but love's not a sin in her eyes
he's telling her why -

Why are you leaving
I just cant say
Why are you leaving
He don't know daddy's gonna stay

Put a little light in her darkest day
so she can see it
put a little love in her heart on the way
so she can feel it

Put a little light in her darkest day
so she can see it
put a little love in her heart on the way
so she can feel it

Why are you leaving
I just cant say
Why are you leaving
He don't know daddy's gonna stay

Put a little light in her darkest day
so she can see it
put a little love in her heart on the way
so she can feel it

Put a little light in her darkest day
so she can see it
put a little love in her heart on the way
so she can feel it
ou wanna see how you're never told
