Title  : A REAL MOTHA FOR YA

(Words & music: Johnny Guitar Watson)

Wanna buy a new car
But the price ain't right (ha ha ain't that cold)
Be a darn sight cheaper (yes I would)
To start riding a bike (listen)
They're makin' milk out of powder (yes they are)
Got the babies cryin' (poor babies they don't
know what that stuff is)
Rent's goin' up higher (yes it is)
Got the parents lyin' (I'll pay you tomorrow)

Refrain:
Lord it's a real mother for ya yeh
Makes you wanna run for cover, yes it will
And if you look you will discover yeah
Lord it's a real mother for ya yeah yow

Got to go to a disco
To throw your troubles away
Dance to the music
That the DJ's play (well alright)
And then the lights come on (yeah)
Like you knew they would (uh huh ain't that cold)
Come home and face the music
That don't sound too good (uh huh ain't that cold)

Refrain: ...
