WEE PAPA GIRL RAPPERS - HEAT IT UP

(Words & music: Samantha & Sandra Lawrence/David Steele)

20,000 words a second in a style you say
Rock rhythms, rock rhythms
With rhythms in a def beat way
Because we never diss that's how we stay
Cool rhyme styles what we portray
Rough rugged is the beat I impress
I'm the one total S's standing supreme
And we don't dream about being known as
Rough so hear us out and yes we are back
Dedicated to the suckers saying we're whack

Refrain:
It's like that yeah
It's like that so heat it up
It's like that yeah
It's like that so heat it up
It's like that yeah
It's like that so heat it up
It's like that yeah
It's like that so heat it up

20,000 tons of mix I'm displaying
Roughing up the rhythm while my rap is
Just playing up and up and never gonna stop
Drop the bass beater while the DJ
Cuts the rhyme and beat is flowing, two Wee Papa
Girl Rappers were knowing

20,000 tons of mix to never too much if you
Can't drop it acid then you've been outa touch
Suckers, rough rugged is the rhymes I comply
It's the one and only, only one MC TY of
Wee Papa Girl Rappers into rocking the house
20,000 tons is just let out

Refrain: ...

Never putting you down
but you're calling our name
You're the only nes playing slag match games
Dummies creating the tension
Feeling bad else you wouldn't mention it
Shocking Wee Papa with the lies you tell
How can you say that when you don't even know us well
Still you have the nerve to do it
You won't rest till you've been all through it
You see days are hard enough, without 
everyone coming on tough
Love peace was raps main aim
But now it's got into an attitude fame
Dip dip dive so socialize this was the
Rap to make us open our eyes
Instead of acting onk one
Because our house weighs a ton
We just keep on with the beat
Until the music is done
