You must be mistaken
It couldn't have been
You couldn't have seen him yesterday
He's doing some deal
Up in Baltimore now
I hate it when he's away

You must be mistaken
I'm sure that you are
There's more than one car with stickers on
And lots of young guys
Wear corduroy pants
And I'd know if he hadn't gone

Take the look off your face
(Take the look off your face)
I can see thru' your smile
(I can see thru your smile)
You would love to be right
I bet you didn't sleep good last night
Couldn't wait
To bring all that bad news to my door
Well I've got news for you
I knew before

If I'm not a mistaken
It started last year
I'm not very clear how it began
I noticed a change
But I just closed my eyes
As only a woman can

No I didn't dig deep
(No I didn't dig deep)
I did not want to know
(I did not want to know)
Well you don't interfere
When you're scared of the things
You might hear when he's back
You think I will end it right there and then
Well my fair weather friend
You're wrong again

take the look off your face,...
