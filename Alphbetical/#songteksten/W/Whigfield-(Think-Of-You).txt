
11. Think Of You - WHIGFIELD

I got me feelin'
It never was part of me
You got me reelin' 
Right into the heart of me
Don't keep me waitin' 
'Cause I need your body tonight
I got me thinkin'
My life it was ending
And when I was sinking
I found me a friend and now
You got me singin' 
I need you beside me tonight! Oh!

When I think of you 
I feel like flyin'
Like a dream come true
Bad times are dyin'
When I think of you 
I need your body tonight

With your affection
My life ain't the same
'Cause it's like resurrection
I'm callin' your name
And you're close to perfection
I need your body tonight! Oh!
I got me thinkin'
My life it was ending
And when I was sinking
I found me a friend and now
You got me singin' 
I need you beside me tonight! Oh!

Chorus

When I think of you, oh! 
When I think of you, oh! 
When I think of you, I need your body tonight!

I got me thinkin'
My life it was ending
And when I was sinking
I found me a friend and now
You got me singin' 
I need you beside me tonight! Oh!

Chorus

When I think of you, oh! 
When I think of you, oh! 
When I think of you, I need your body tonight!

Chorus

La ba da ba - dee be dee da da da 
La ba da ba - dee be dee da da da 
La ba da ba - dee be dee da da da 
La ba da ba -  And I need your body tonight - oh

When I think of you
I feel like flyin'
Like a dream come true
