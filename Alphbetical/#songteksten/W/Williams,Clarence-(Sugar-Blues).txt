Sugar Blues.
Ev'rybody's singing the Sugar Blues.
The whole town is ringing,
my lovin' man's sweet as he can be
but the doggone fool turned sour on me.
I'm so unhappy
I feel so bad,
I could lay me down and die.
you can say what you choose
but i'm all confused,
I've got the sweet, sweet
Sugar blues, more sugar, 
I've got the sweet, sweet Sugar Blues.

Have you heard these blues
that I'm going to sing to you.
When you hear them
they will thrill you thro' and thro'.
They're the sweetest blues you ever heard.
Now listen and don't say a word:

Sugar Blues.
Ev'rybody's singing the Sugar Blues.
The whole town is ringing,
I love my coffee, I love my tea,
but the doggone cream turned sour on me.
I'm so unhappy
I feel so bad,
I could lay me down and die.
you can say what you choose
but i'm all confused,
I've got the sweet, sweet
Sugar blues, more sugar, 
I've got the sweet, sweet Sugar Blues.

I just love sweet food,
puts me in a nice sweet mood,
when I'm like that,
you will never find me rude.
I'm as sweet as can be
I was told
but now he says that I'm too old:

Sugar Blues.
Ev'rybody's singing the Sugar Blues.
The whole town is ringing,

but the doggone fool turned sour on me.
I'm so unhappy
I feel so bad,
I could lay me down and die.
you can say what you choose
but i'm all confused,
I've got the sweet, sweet
Sugar blues, more sugar, 
I've got the sweet, sweet Sugar Blues.
