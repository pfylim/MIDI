He let the world right in
so let this tale begin
He spoke it out loud and clear
Then he shelved another frozen tear
then he spoke it out loud and clear
But the pain got in

He always runs behind
He's only running blind
from the hurt that
your heart's not worth healing

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

He looks at the papers the grooves been jammed
looks at the world gettin' off
on a rhythm that just hits him out of time
easy in the mornin' he says it's  easier at night
keeps his secrets clothed in white
wrapped so tight it's gonna blow his mind

He always runs behind
He's only running blind
from the hurt that
your heart's not worth healing

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Look up every time
I feel like looking down
I look down every time you wear that pretty gown
I look up every time I look around
but remember we always said
it'll be easy on the way

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight

Come on and make it tonight
come on this world's not so bright
come on and make it tonight
