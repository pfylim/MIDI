Made a record was a star over night
My future looked shiny and bright
And when the second one started to climb
I thought the whole world was mine
The smell of success number one in the polls
All these gold albums thought of buying a Rolls
Thought it seems long ago I still know

Chorus:
Goodbye to girls and Cadillacs
I hade my share, I had a ball
Goodbye to girls and Cadillacs
I've seen it all the climb and the fall from the top

I was the face in every magazine
Being a dream of almost every teen
Turning those pages it seems like ages
A faded poster on the wall
Still having success in a club or hall
Still having a good time having a ball
Now I know the name of the game

Chorus: ...
