Modern love 
is a funny thing
it's full of diamonds
and a pretty ring
but it's gonna get me
get me so down

Summer loving
makes me freeze
it leaves me standing
in a cold, cold breeze
so I'm gonna get me
oh, I'm gonna get me
get me outa town and stop wasting time

Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion
Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion

I don't want to keep on waiting staring my own
Celebration

Sisters loving
is a strong, strong thing
it's never ending
and it don't need no diamond ring
but it won't leave them
but it won't leave them
in a cold cold time
these are difficult times to be celebrating

Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion
Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion

I don't want to keep on waiting staring my own
Celebration
these are difficult times to be celebrating

Summer loving
makes me freeze
it leaves me standing
in a cold, cold breeze
so I'm gonna get me
oh, I'm gonna get me
get me outa town 

Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion
Everytime I look into her eyes
they're filled with such emotion

I don't want to keep on waiting staring my own
Celebration
