WANG CHUNG - DANCE HALL DAYS

Take your baby by the hand
And make her do a high handstand
And take your baby by the heel
And do the next thing that you feel

Refrain:
We were so in phase
In our dance hall days
We were cool on craze
When I, you and everyone we knew
Could believe, do and share in what we do
Oh, I said: dance all day long
Take your baby by the hair
And pull her close and there, there, there
Take your baby by the ears
And play upon her darkest fears

Refrain: ...

Take your baby by the wrist
And in her mouth an amethyst
And in her eyes two sapphires blue
And you need her and she needs you

Refrain: ...

Oh I said dance all day long
Dance all day long
Dance all day
