Title  : Club Tropicana
Singer : Wham


Let me take you to the place
Where membership's a smiling face
Brush shoulders with the stars
Where strangers take you by the hand
And welcome you to wonderland
From beneath their panamas...

Chorus:
Club Tropicana, drinks are free
Fun and sunshine - there's enough for everyone
All that's missing is the sea
But don't worry, you can suntan!

Castaways and lovers meet
Then kiss in Tropicana's heat
Watch the waves break on the bay
Soft white sands, a blue lagoon
Cocktail time, a summer's tune
A whole night's holiday!

Chorus

Pack your bags
And leave tonight
Don't take your time
Gotta move your feet, don't miss the flight!
Gotta move your feet, don't miss the flight!
Cool, cool, cool, cool

Chorus

Cool, cool, cool, cool (2x)


Words & Music : George Michael, Andrew Ridgeley
