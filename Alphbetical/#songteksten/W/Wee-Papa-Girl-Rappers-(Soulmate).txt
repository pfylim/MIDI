WEE PAPA GIRL RAPPERS - SOULMATE

Before I met you
I didn't know what love was about
But now that I have you
I know my life is complete
With you as my soulmate

When I met you I really fell in love
So deep not deep enough
You made me feel so satisfied
The only thing in life that keeps me staying alive
Can't you see I really need you
You brighten my life and make me feel true
So just never leave me babe
'Cause if you want my love don't hesitate

What I really need is your security
Love you to the best of my ability
No one in the world can mean as much to me
Right by your side is where I wanna be

refrain:
What does it take to make you understand
I want to be more than friends
You're my soulmate
'Cause what we got together could last forever
You're my soulmate
I'm telling you this because I love your kiss
You're my soulmate
'Cause what I need the most only you can deliver
You're my soulmate
It's a fatal attraction that I can't resist

When we are alone I try my best to explain
How I feel inside because we're two of the same
Kind of people who need each other
I want to have more need  you as my lover
Because being friends is not the same thing
I'm letting you know of the loving I'll bring
And being soulmates is what I need
And having you here knows we'll succeed
You by my side keeps me staying alive
Without you near my feelings I'd hide
Soulmate to me is of a love to share
Just being together and knowing you care

refrain: ...

Hit it hey hey you
Uh-huh check check check check it out
Soulmate forever that's what you are
We do the same things together two alike a star
Hold you make me reach to the heights
Your slightest touch mind on fire but you know this
There's no need for me to tell you
You brighten my life and make me feel true
Hey soulmate you are my mind
You are my body we are two of a kind
How can I explain what I just don't know
I don't want to be pushy but I don't want you to go
I'll show you now so don't hesitate
You and I are soulmates
