I wish those days could 
Come back once more
I hate those days yeah 
When I have to go
I wish those days could 
Come back once more
I hate those days yeah 
Where I have to go
Cause I love her so

I was born in Little Rock 
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand 
I wore hard top shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I knew I loved her every day
Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live her
Yeah hey, ooh baby
I was made to love her
Cause my world was all around her
Hey hey hey

For once in my life
I have some one who needs me
Some one I needed so long 
For once unafraid that a girl really needs me
Some how I know I`ll be strong
For once I can say there`s none who can take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have some one who needs me

Very superstitious
Writing`s on the wall
Very superstitious
Let us not to fall
When you believe in things 
That you don`t understand 
And you suffer
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over me
They can feel it all over 
They can feel it all over me

Everybody`s got a thing 
But some don`t know how to handle it
All this reaching out in vain 
It`s taking the face not to have it  
Don`t you worry `bout a thing
Don`t you worry `bout a thing Mama
Cause I`ll be standing on your side

There`s a place in the sun
Where there`s hope for every one
And my poor restless heart`s gotta run
I know there`s a place in the sun 
And before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

Everybody say yeah 
Say yeah say yeah
Yeah yeah baby
