Strung out on the east side of town
weighing up my latest pleasure
in two days time I'll be given a sign
that puts me in a place I get high

Meanwhile there's no reply, it's a one way conversation
in two days time I'll be given a sign
that puts me with the stars in the sky
and with the sun im my eyes
you know that I can't see
just like the stars in the sky
you know, I'll be

Counting down the headlights
brings me down to earth
2 days after midnite baby
I'll be there

Strung out on the edge of the east side of town
weighing up my latest pleasure
in two days' time, I'll leave it behind
and put it in a place I can find

Meantime I'm drawing the line, it's a no win situation
in two days time I'll get the sign
scaring myself outa my mind
and with the sun in my eyes
you know that I can't see
just like tha stars in the sky
you know, I'll be

Counting down the headlights
brings me down to earth
2 days after midnite baby
I'll be there

If I disappear, that would make it clear
strung out on the edge on the east side of town
weighing up my latest measure
freaking out on this sensation
Guarantees my destination

And with the sun in my eyes
you know that I can't see
just like the stars in the sky
you know, I'll be

Counting down the headlights
brings me down to earth
2 days after midnite baby
I'll be there

Counting down the headlights
brings me down to earth
2 days after midnite baby
I'll be there
