Title  : I AM BUT A SMALL VOICE
Artist : ROGER WHITAKER

(Words & music: Odina Batnag/Roger Whitaker)

I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
The fragance of a flower
In the  unpolluted air

I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
To smile upon the sun
Be free to dance and sing
Be free to sing my song everywhere

Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one
Come young citizens of the world
We are one, we are one
We have one hope
We have one dream
And woth one voice we sing

Peace give us peace
Prosperity, prosperity
And love for all mankind
Prosperity, prosperity
And love for all mankind

I am but a small voice
I have but a small dream
The fragance of a flower
In the  unpolluted air

Sing peace
Peace give us peace
Prosperity, prosperity
And love for all mankind
Peace give us peace
Prosperity, prosperity
And love for all mankind
