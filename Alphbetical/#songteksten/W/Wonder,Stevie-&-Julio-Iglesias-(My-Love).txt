STEVIE WONDER & JULIO IGLESIAS - MY LOVE

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you
Who's my true love
Tell them my love true
Is ever letting all their love come through

My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love
Fits to the tune of you
Then you can say
That you are my love too

Refrain:
Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
Till love's all over

Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
Till it is present and no more
Is pain all over

Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray till all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough
To say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free

Refrain: ...

Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spread love all over

Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people
