Title  : EIGHTEEN WITH A BULLET

I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm picked to click now, I'm the son of a gun
So hold it right there little girl, we're gonna have big fun

I may be an oldie, but I'm a goodie too
I'll last forever, and I'll be good to you
(Oh yes I will)

I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm a super soul sure shot, yeah, I'm a national breakout
So let me check our play list mama, come on, let's make out

I'm high on the chart, tipped for the top
But till I'm in your heart, I ain't never gonna stop
(never, never baby)
We got a smash doubleheader, if we only stay together
Talkin' 'bout you..., talkin' 'bout me...

I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
Be my A-side baby, be beside me
Right now I'm a single, but pretty soon you'll see
We'll have a hit first time, won't be too long, you'll find
That we're raising a whole L.P.

I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
