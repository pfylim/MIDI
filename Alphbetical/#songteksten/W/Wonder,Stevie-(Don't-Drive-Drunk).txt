STEVIE WONDER - DON'T DRIVE DRUNK

He and his wife had problems
That he's played off like nothing's wrong
Till he comes home from work early
Just to find the girl is gone
Oh, but he gets into the cupboard
Picks out that bottle of gin
Drinks like there's no tomorrow
And decides to take spin

Refrain:
Oh, don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
Mother against drunk drivers are mad

Teenager at a live party
Says 'Give me one for the road'
But he's already so inebriated
If you lit a smoke, he'd explode
Oh, but barkeeper says 'I don't think so'
Young one says I can deal
Staggering he says 'Check y'all later'
But I really don't think he will

Refrain: ...

Boy out with girl on their first date
Gets pulled over by the law
Officer says 'Hey, can't you drive straight?'
'Or have you been drinking alcohol?'
Boy says 'Man, are you crazy?'
Cop says 'Hey, then walk this line'
But results from the breathauzer proves he's
charged with D.V.1

Don't drive drunk
Don't drive drunk
No, don't drive drunk
Mother against drunk drivers are mad
