Title  : IN ZAIRE

Once there was a battle there, in Zaire, in Zaire
Hundred thousand people there, in Zaire, in Zaire
All those people gathered there, in Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there, in Zaire

There came a man called Elijah, in Zaire, in Zaire
With him came the superstar, in Zaire, in Zaire
All those people came from far, in Zaire, in Zaire
To see the rumble in the jungle there, in Zaire

And who was the victor in the night?
Elijah Mohammed's boy Ali won the fight, in Zaire
The light'ning struck twice in the night
First in the ring and then after the fight
In Zaire, in Zaire, in Zaire, in Zaire

All those people chanted there, in Zaire, in Zaire
Seven rounds of torture there, in Zaire, in Zaire
One more round and Ali's there, in Zaire, in Zaire
There was great excitement everywhere, in Zaire
