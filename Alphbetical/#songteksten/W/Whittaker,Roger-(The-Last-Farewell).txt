Title  : THE LAST FAREWELL

There's a ship lies rigged and ready in the harbour
Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be on board that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

Refrain:
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken world can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken world can tell

I heard there's a wicked war a blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a raising
Their guns on fire as we sailed into hell
I have no fear of death it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

Refrain: ...

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the sea
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
In the heaving waves that brought me once to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dell

Refrain: ...
