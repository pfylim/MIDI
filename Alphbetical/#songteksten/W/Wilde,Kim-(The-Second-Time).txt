KIM WILDE - THE SECOND TIME

Gogo

Don't wanna know about vacations
In this cheap motel
Don't wanna know about your sea-green
curtains
'Cause all I want'n'all I need
Is just some time with you
Don't complicate it just do it once again

Just go for it
Just go for the second time
Just go for it, just go

Just go

Don't wanna hear about
The time 'n' how it's getting late
How can you stop when I could go on for ours (go)
You need some magic, come on let me
lean on you
Don't look around, you're not going anywhere

Refrain: ...

Just go for it
'Cause all I need, all I need, 'n'all I need
all I need
'Cause all I want'n'all I need
I'm never letting you go baby
Don't expect me to
How can you stop when
My whole world's exploding (go)

Look in the mirrors and see
The heat of something new
Why don't we do it just do it once again

Refrain: ...

(go) just go for it (go)

Don't be so nervous, don't get so hot
Just let it open all up
'Cause all I want and all I need

There's such an urgency
In everything I need from you
Stop giving up you know
You can't refuse me (go)
I've every reason to believe
There's still a man in you
You've done it once so come on go again

Refrain: ...
