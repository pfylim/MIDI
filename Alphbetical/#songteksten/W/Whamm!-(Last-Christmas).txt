WHAM! - LAST CHRISTMAS

Refrain:
Last X-mas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me
Well it's been a year it doesn't surprise me
I wrapped it now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Refrain: ...(2x)...

A crowded room friends with tired eyes
Am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again

Refrain: ...(2x)...

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore him apart
May be next year I'll give it someone
I'll give it to someone special
