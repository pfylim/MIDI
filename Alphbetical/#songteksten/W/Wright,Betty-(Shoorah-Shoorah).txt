Title  : SHOORAH SHOORAH

You got to wake up early in the morning
You got to stay up all night long
You still won't catch up 'cause I got the warnin'
I've got the feelin' you want to do me wrong

Like a ball of lightning and a bolt of heat
You wanna knock me right off my feet
But I recognize thru' the eyes of a fool
That you've got the power to make your own rules

Refrain:
Shoorah, shoorah, said I can see you comin'
Shoorah, shoorah, but you won't catch me
Shoorah, shoorah, I can hear you hummin'
Shoorah, shoorah, but you won't catch me

I can see you moving all around me
I know you're trying to get me upset
I can hear you groovin' thinking you done found me
But I'm here to tell you you ain't got me yet no no

Refrain: ...

I checked you out from the corner of my eye
You and the devil walkin' side by side
And you ain't changed let's be real about it
And I can't change how I feel about it

Refrain: ...
