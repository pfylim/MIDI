Title  : KIDS IN AMERICA
Artist : KIM WILDE

(Words & music: R. Wilde/M. Wilde)

Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and ev'ryone's moving
I can feel the heat, but it's soothing heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town
Down town, the young ones are going never kind
Down town, the young ones are growing

Chorus:
We're the kids in America, we're the kids in America
Ev'rybody lives for the music go round
Round, la la la la la la la

Bright light the music gets faster
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance
Hot shot give me no problems
Much later, baby you'll be saying: never mind
You know life is cruel
Life is never kind
Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory

Chorus: ...

Come closer honey, that's better
Got to get a brand new experience, feeling right
Oh don't try to stop, baby hold me tight
Outside a new day is dawning
Outside suburb I a's sprawling ev'rywhere
I don't want to go, baby
New York to East California
There's a new wave coming, I warn you

Chorus: ...
