WENDY & LISA - SATISFACTION

(Words & music: Wendy & Lisa)

Every time you come around
It makes me way too crazy
Crazy enough to think you'll ask me out
Yes you are the talk of town so congratulations
With a smile as good as gold so don't wear a frown

Every time I see you down still you're not too bitter
You don't need a babysitter to keep you on your cloud
Baby you know it's true I'll never be too uptight
To wrap you in my love to just satisfy ya

Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction
Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction

Every time you come around
My heart beats a little faster
You're all the drug I'm sure I'll ever need
All the time I do believe your love is like a prayer
I can take you there if you feel the need

If you let me have it all I'll shoot for satisfaction
'Cause nothing's ever meant so much to me
But keep in your mind we've got to keep on dancing
If all else fails oh won't you dance with me

Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction
Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction
If love can melt down barriers I think I'll marry ya

Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction, yeah yeah
Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction

Every time I turn around
The shadow of you is still with me
But a shadow just can't take the place of you
When we touch caress cool kiss me deep my baby
All I have is for you

Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction, oh oh
Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction

Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction
Didn't your mama tell ya, didn't your papa tell ya
To get a little satisfaction, woh

If love can melt down barriers baby I think I'll marry ya
