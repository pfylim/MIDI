Title  : GONNA GET ALONG WITHOUT YOU NOW

(Words & music: Milton Kellern)

Chorus:
Got along without you before I met you
Gonna get along without you now
Gonna find somebody twice as cute
'Cause you didn't love me anyhow

You told me I was the neatest thing
Even asked me to wear your ring
Rand around with every girl in town
Never cared if it got me down

Boom boom boom boom
Gonna get along without you now
Boom boom boom boom
Gonna get along without you now

Chorus: ...

You told everybody that we were friends
This is where our friendship ends
All of a sudden you changed your tune
Haven't been around since way last june

Boom boom boom boom
Gonna get along without you now
Boom boom boom boom
Gonna get along without you now
Boom boom boom boom
Gonna get along without you now
