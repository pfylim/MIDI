Title  : IF YOU COULD READ MY MIND
Artist : VIOLA WILLS

(Words & music: Gordon Lightfoot)

Keep falling
I can read your mind
Keep falling
I can read your mind

If you could read my mind love
What a tale my thoughts could tell
Just like an oldtime movie
About a ghost from a wishing well

In a castle dark
Or fortress strong
With chains upon my feet
You know that ghost is me
And I will never be set free
As long as I am a ghost you can see

If I could read your mind love
What a tale your thoughts could tell
Just like a paperback novel
All the kind that drugstores sell

And when you reach the part
Where the heartaches come
The halloween would be mine
But halloweens often sale
And you won't read that book again
Because the end is just too hard to take

I walk away like a moviestar
Whe gets burnt in a three way script
And enter number two
The movie came to play the scene
And bringing all the good things out in me

But for now love let's be real
I never thought I could feel this way
And I have got to say
I don't know where we went wrong
But the feeling is gone
And I just can't get it back
