Singer : GEORGE BAKER SELECTION 
Title  : MORNING SKY


Don't hide your heart behind the wall
Don't walk alone the gray and dark night
Look to the sky and you'll be alright
There is a sun for you to shine
Look at yourself what do you see
A child that feared to be alone maybe a
Heart without a home but someone's
Waiting there for you

Morning sky, let me touch your golden sunlight
Let me dream away the dark night
Let me ride your silver clouds
Morning sky, promise me a new tomorrow
Push away my pain and sorrow
In God's golden morning sky

Be like a river wide and strong
Don't be afraid to hurt a friend
So let your life will be a song sing with
A feeling in your heart
