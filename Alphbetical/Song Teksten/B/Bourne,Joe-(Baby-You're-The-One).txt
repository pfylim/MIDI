Title  : BABY YOU'RE THE ONE

(Words & music: M. van Wijk/U. Anderson)

Baby don't want no other
I found a lover I'm satisfied
Woman you are my sunshine
You keep me happy for my life

Don't you need no one to give me satisfaction
I like your reaction and it's fine
Don't need no one to tell me what to do
Girl, I got my hands tied with you

Chorus:
Baby, baby you're the one for me
(Baby you're the one)
Baby, baby can't you see
(Baby you're the one)

Baby you're my inspiration
You give me courage to go on

Chorus: ...
