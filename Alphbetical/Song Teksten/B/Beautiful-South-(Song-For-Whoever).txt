BEAUTIFUL SOUTH - SONG FOR WHOEVER

(Words & music: Heaton/Rothoray)

I love you from the bottom of my pencil case
I love you in the songs, I write and sing

Love you because you put me in your rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring

Cheap never cheap
I sing you songs 'til you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down

Oh Shirley, oh Debbie, oh Julie, oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name (I forget your name)
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forgot your name

I love you from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write it down each wrinkle of your face
And I love you 'til my fountain pen runs dry

Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep
So cry lovely cry cry cry cry

Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you

So let me talk about Mary, a sad story
Turning her grieve into glory
Late at night, under typewriter light
Ripped his ribbon to shreds
