Title  : SUNDAY GIRL

(Words & music: Chris Stein)

I know a girl from a lonely street
Cold as ice cream but still as sweet
Dry your eyes sunday girl

Hey I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide sunday girl

Chorus:
Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week
And still I wait
I got the blues, please come see
What your loving means to me

She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams sunday girl

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you
My folks'll get uptight
Stay at home sunday girl

Hey I saw your love with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide sunday girl

When I saw you again in the summer time
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be sunday's girl

Chorus: ...
