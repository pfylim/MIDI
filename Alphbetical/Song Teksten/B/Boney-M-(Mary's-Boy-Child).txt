Title  : MARY'S BOY CHILD

(Words & music: Jester Hairston)

Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Chorus:
Hark now hear the angels sing
New King's born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherd watched their flocks by night
They saw a bright new, shining star
And heard a choir from heaven sing
The music came from afar

Chorus: ...

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Came to Bethlehem that night
They found no place to bear her child
Not a single room was in sight
By and by they found a little nook
In a stable all for Iorn
And in a manger, cold and dark
Mary's little boy child was born

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

Chorus: ...
