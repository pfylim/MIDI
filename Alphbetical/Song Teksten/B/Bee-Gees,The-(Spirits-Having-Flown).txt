Title  : SPIRITS HAVING FLOWN

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb)

I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow
I carry on

Chorus:
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before having flown

Faster than lightning is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on

I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone
Never before having flown

I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live in the air?
You're my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling that starts
From the moment you're there

You'll never know what you have done for me
You've broken all those rules I live up on

I'd like to take you to my shangrila
Neither here or far away from home
Never before having flown

Chorus: ...
