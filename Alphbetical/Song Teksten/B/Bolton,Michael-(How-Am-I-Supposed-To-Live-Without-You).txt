                  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU                                

     Performed by: Michael Bolton


     I could hardly believe it, when I heard the news today,...
     I had to come and get it straight from you-ou...
     they said you were leavin', someone swept your heart away,...
     from that look upon your face, I see it's true oh!...
     so tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'...
     oh-oh!,...tell me one thing more before I go...

     Tell me how am I supposed to live without you,...
     now that I've been lovin' you so lo-o-ong?...
     how am I supposed to live without you?,...
     an' how am I supposed to carry on,.....
     when all that I've been livin' for is gone?..........

     I'm too tired for cryin', didn't come here to break down,...
     it's just a dream of mine is comin' to an e-e-end...
     and how can I blame you,..when I built my world around..
     the hope that one day..we'd be so much more than frie-ie-iends...
     now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreamin',...
     oh-oh!...even now it's more than I can ta-ake...

     Tell me how am I supposed to live without you,...
     now that I've been lovin' you so lo-o-ong?...
     how am I supposed to live without you?,...
     an' how am I supposed to carry on,.....
     when all that I've been livin' for is gone?...

     GUITAR SOLO....................................................
     ...................

     Now I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreamin',...
     oh-oh!...now that your dream has come true-ue-ue...

     Tell me how am I supposed to live without you,...
     now that I've been lovin' you so lo-o-ong?...
     how am I supposed to live without you?,...
     an' how am I supposed to carry o-on,.....
     when all that I've been livin' for...is gone?.............
