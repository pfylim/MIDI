  Johnny B. Goode - Chuck Berry

  
  Deep down in Lousiana, close to New Orleans
  Way' back up in the woods among the evergreens,
  There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood, 
  Where lived a country boy named Johnny B Goode.
  Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well,
  But he could play the guitar just a ringin' bell.
  
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go
  Johnny B Goode
  
  He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
  Go seat beneath the tree by the railroad track;
  Ol' engineer in the train sittin' in the shade,
  Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
  The people passin' by, they would stop and say
  Oh my, but that little country boy could play.
  
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go
  Johnny B Goode
  
  His mother told him: "Some day you'll be a man
  and you will be the leader of a big old band,
  Many people comin' from miles around,
  To hear you play your music till the sun goes down.
  Maybe some day your name' ll be in lights
  A sayin' JOHNNY B GOODE Tonight".
  
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go!
  Go! Go! Go! Johnny go
