BROTHER BEYOND - THE HARDER I TRY

(Words & music: Stock/Aitken/Waterman)

Whenever I meet you
You give me such a run around
The more that I see you
The more you just put me down
Even in front of all my friends
You just want to hurt me
But I'll never give up hoping
'Til I make you mine

Refrain:
Whaaa, the harder I try
The further away from me it's slipping
I'll go on trying
To make you love me

I wanted to see you
I call you on the telephone
Just to be near you
They tell me you're not home
I guess you say that I'm a fool
To want you so badly
But I'll never give up hoping
'Til I make you mine

Refrain: ...2x...

I'll go on trying
I'll go on trying
I'll go on trying
I'll go on trying

I should have believed them
Just put them right in their place
I tried to impress you
Even in front of all my friends
You just want to hurt me
But I'll never give up hoping
'Til I make you mine

Whaaa
