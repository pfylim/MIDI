Title  : And The Wall Came Tumbling Down
Singer : Bolland & Bolland


Old eyes look at the sky
Longing for a reason
Never wondering why
Twenty-eight years
Of struggle and strife
So many tears
So many lies
Young eyes look at the sky

Longing for freedom
Never knowing why
Post-war boy
Post-war girl
Wanna sail the oceans
Wanna see the world

And the wall came tumbling down
And the wall came tumbling down

Prisoners since '61

Always the rain
Never the sun
Unter den linden
Alexanderplatz
Always looking west
But never touch

'Ich bin ein berliner!'
(J.F. Kennedy)
'Tear down this wall!'
(Ronald Reagan)

And the wall came tumbling down
Down, down
Oh, down to the ground
Down, down
