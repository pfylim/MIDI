Title  : THIS IS MY LIFE

(Words & music: Norman Newell/Bruno Canfora)

Funny how a lonely day
Can make a person say
What good is my life
Funny how a breaking heart
Can make me start to say
What good is my life
Funny how I often seem to think
I'll find another dream in my life
Till I look around and see
This great big world
Is part of me and my life

Chorus:
This is my life today
Tomorrow love will come and find me
For that's the way that I was born to be
This is me, this is me, this is my life
I never give a damn for lost emotions
I've such a lot of love, I've got to give
Let me live, let me live, live my life

Sometimes when I feel afraid
I think of what a mess
I've made of my life
Crying over the mistakes
Forgetting all the breaks
I've had in my life
I was put on earth to be
A part of this great world is me and my life
Guess I'll just add up the score
And count the things
I'm grateful for in my life
