A goddess on a mountain top burning like a silver flame,
Summit of beauty and love, and Venus was her name.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
She's got it, yeah baby she's got it.
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire at your desire,
Well I'm your Venus, I'm your fire at your desire.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Her weapons were her crystal eyes making ev'ry man mad.
Black as a dark night she was, got what no else had.

Refrain: 2*
---------------------------------------------------------------------
She's got it,...  
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A goddess on a mountain top burning like a silver flame,...

Venus was her name -
Yeah, baby she's got it.
