Title  : KISS ME KISS YOUR BABY

Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
Come on and tell me that it's me you love
Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
Am I the one that you've been thinking of

Now at last I'm home and we're all alone
Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
And make it all alright

Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
Baby you know that I've been missing you
Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
It's so nice to be kissed by you

There's so much to say in so many ways
Gonna hug and kiss you baby
And make it good tonight

Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
Come on and tell me that it's me you love
Come on and kiss me kiss your baby
Am I the one that you've been thinking of
