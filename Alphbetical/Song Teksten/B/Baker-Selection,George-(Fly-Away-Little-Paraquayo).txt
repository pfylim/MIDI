Singer : GEORGE BAKER SELECTION 
Title  : FLY AWAY LITTLE PARAQUAYO

They come in a white boat many years ago
They gave you presents and promised you a lot
But they locked you on a chain put you in a mine
And they said work for the glory of our god

Fly away little paraquayo
Spread your wings up to the sky
Fly away little paraquayo
'Cause the white man is on the ride
And your body is so hungry
And your mind is filled with fear
Fly away little paraquayo
'Cause the soldiers soon be here

They said you're just an indian
Not better than a beast
Only good for working like a slave
And so your sweat and run till the day is done
While you know you could be better in your grave
