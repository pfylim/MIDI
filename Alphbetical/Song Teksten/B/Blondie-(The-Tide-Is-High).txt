Artist : BLONDIE

(Words & music: John Holt)

Chorus:
The tide is high, but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh no!

It's not the things you do
That tease and hurt me bad
But it's the way you do the things you do to me
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh no!

Chorus: ...

Ev'ry girl wants you to be her man
But I'll wait my dear, till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh no!

Chorus: ...
