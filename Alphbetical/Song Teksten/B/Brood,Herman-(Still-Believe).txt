Singer : HERMAN BROOD & HIS WILD ROMANCE 
Title  : STILL BELIEVE

(Words & music: P. Smeenk/B. Borgers)

You make me feel
Like I've drawn a losers card
'Cause every time you walk out of me
I find myself left with a broken heart

And it ain't my way to quit now
'Cause I came to win, child
I may have run out of luck
But I'm pretty sure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come back again

Keep on trying child
Keep on trying
Keep on trying

I still believe that I can win
Still believe that I can win
Still believe that I can win
Your love

Find myself in a freight train (Intercity train, rolling down the
line)
Rolling down the track
Through the hazy landscape
Of winter time
I scored myself some hard porno
The new Playboy
I got a new Penthouse
Doing the handjive
Just to kill the time

It ain't my way to quit now
I cam in to win
May have run out of luck
But I'm pretty sure
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come back again
It's gonna come back again
Keep on trying
Keep on trying
Keep on trying

I still believe that I can win
Still believe that I can win
Still believe that I can win
Your love
