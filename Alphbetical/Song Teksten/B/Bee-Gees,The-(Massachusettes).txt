                                    Massachusetts


Feel I'm going back to Massachusetts, something's telling me I must go home.
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts, the day I left her standing on her own.

Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco, gotta do the things I wanna do.
And the lights all went down in Massachusetts, they brought me back to see my way with you.

Talk about the life in Massachusetts, speak about the people I have seen.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
