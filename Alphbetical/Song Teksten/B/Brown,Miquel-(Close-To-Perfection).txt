MIQUEL BROWN - CLOSE TO PERFECTION

Our love will stand the test of time
Sweeter than the honey from the bees
When you're not here, a song won't rhyme
And the birds don't sing in the trees
You can make the sun come out
Without you the sky is grey
Love and laughter's what you're about
So don't you ever go away

Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached the new direction
On our ways to affection

Every day can feel like spring
As you have the power to make me glow
Suddenly the bells, start to ring
Life becomes a Broadway show
You make music till the end
Like a symphony of love
I can see rainbows everywhere
Lighting up the sky above

You're close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached the new direction
On our ways to affection

(solo)

There's a new excitement around
Every time I see you smile
An experience of sight and sound
That's with me all the time
You have built an empty space
Showing me that you care
It's a feeling I won't replace
A lifetime you and I can share

You're close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached the new direction
On our ways to affection

(Close to perfection
Close to perfection
We have reached the new direction
On our ways to affection)

You're closer, closer, closer to perfection
Love is what you're all about
You can face the sun come out
Say you're closer, closer, closer, closer to perfection
See you feel that it's real
