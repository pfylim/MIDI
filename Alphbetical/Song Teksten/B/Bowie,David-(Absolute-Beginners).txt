Title  : Absolute Beginners
Singer : David Bowie


I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I am an absolute beginner
But I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

If our lovesong could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason to feel
All the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't share
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

If our lovesong could fly over mountains
Could sail over heartaches 
Just like the films
There's no reason to feel 
All the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
