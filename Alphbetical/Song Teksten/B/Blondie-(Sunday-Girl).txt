I know a girl from a lonely street
cold as ice cream but still as sweet
dry your eyes sunday girl. 

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
looks like he's in another world
run and hide sunday girl.

Hurry up, hurry up and wait
I stay away all week
and still I wait
I got the blues, please come and see
what your lovin' means to me.

She can't catch up with the working crowd
the weekend mood and she's feeling proud
live in dreams sunday girl.

Baby, I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you
my folks'll get uptight
stay at home sunday girl.

Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl
looks like he's in another world
run and hide sunday girls.

When I saw you again in the summer time
if your love was as sweet as mine
I could be sunda's girl
hurry up, hurry up and wait,...
