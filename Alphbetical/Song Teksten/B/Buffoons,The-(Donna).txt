Singer : THE BUFFOONS 
Title  : DONNA

I had a girl, Donna was her name
Since she left me, I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna where can you be? Where can you be?
Now that you're gone, I'm left all alone
All by myself to wander and roam
How I love my girl
Donna where can you be? Where can you be?
Well Donna now that you're gone
I don't know what I'll do
All the time and all my love for you
I had a girl, Donna was her name
Since she's been gone
I've never been the same
'Cause I love my girl
Donna where can you be? Where can you be? Be?
