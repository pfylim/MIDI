Title  : DON'T BE CRUEL

You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least, please telephone
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

Baby if I made you mad
For something I might have said
Please let's forget the past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true

I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
Come on over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Why should we be apart
I really love you baby cross my heart

Walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you have me
And I'll know I'll have you too
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of

Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
Don't be cruel
To a heart that's true
I don't want no other love
Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of
