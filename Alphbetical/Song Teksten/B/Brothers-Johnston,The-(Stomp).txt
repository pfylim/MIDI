Singer : THE BROTHERS JOHNSON
Title  : STOMP

(Words & music: L. Johnson/G. Johnson/V. Johnson/R. Temperton)

Steppin' out, the weekend's open wide
Fill it up, let's blast the jams and ride
While we're cruisin' around, in the street
Listen up for the partyin' feet
Slap me five, that's the place we've arrived, it's alive

Chorus:
Everybody take it to the top
We gonna stomp all night
In the neighborhood
Don't it feel alright
Gonna stomp all night
Wanna party till the mornin' light
Mmm, runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ooh, uh, uh

The set is hot, there's people wall to wall
Old ones, young thing, short ones standing tall
So grab the one with the smile on her face
And hit the floor and stay right on the case
The heat is on and the funk just won't leave us alone

Chorus: ...

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heel where you've feelin' it
Put your heel where you've feelin' it

Chorus: ...

Stomp, step down in it
Put your foot where you feel the fit
Take it to the top
Stomp, you don't wanna quit
Put your heel where you're feel the fit
