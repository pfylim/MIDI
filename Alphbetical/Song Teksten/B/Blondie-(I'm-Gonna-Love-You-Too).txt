Title  : I'M GONNA LOVE YOU TOO

(Words & music: Norman Petty/Buddy Holly)

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

You're gonna say a miss me
You're gonna say a kiss me
And you're gonna say a love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say a hold me
And you're gonna say a love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

After all the love affairs that tricked you
But I still can oversleep you
I'm gonna do my best to hook you
After all you said love me

I don't care what you told me
You're gonna say a hold me
And you're gonna say a love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

You're gonna tell me sweet everything
And you're gonna make my heart sing
And I'm gonna have something
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

After all the love affairs that tricked you
But I still can oversleep you
I'm gonna do my best to hook you
After all you said love me

You're gonna say a miss me
You're gonna say a kiss me
And you're gonna say a love me
'Cause I'm gonna love you too

I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
I'm gonna love you too
