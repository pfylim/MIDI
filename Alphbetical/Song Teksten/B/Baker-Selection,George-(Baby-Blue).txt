Singer : GEORGE BAKER SELECTION 
Title  : BABY BLUE

She wrote me today
That she won't come back to stay
That she only comes to pick up her clothes
She wrote I must not cry
That her love for me has died
But she found somebody else I suppose

Baby Blue
Baby Blue
Do you know that I'm still in love with you
Now I know that you won't be here no more
How I need you how I want you
Baby Blue

I know I must forget
All the good times we had
But, I'll know that I can't forget you
You're still on my mind
And I know I can't find
Such a girl as my sweet
Baby Blue
