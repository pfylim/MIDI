
8. SOUL OF MY SOUL - MICHAEL BOLTON

WE MAY BE STRONGER
WE MAY BE WORLDS APART SOMETIMES
AND IT'S HARD TO ACCEPT
THE THINGS WE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
SO BLIND TO EACH OTHER
WE ONLY SEE ONE SIDE OF NOWHERE
SOME THINGS WE MAY NEVER KNOW
IF THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD EVER KNOW

CHORUS:
SOUL OF MY SOUL, HEART OF MY HEART
THE GRATEST TREASURE OF MY LIFE
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE
SOUL OF MY SOUL, CHILD OF MY HEART
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW
SOUL OF MY SOUL

INTO THIS WORLD
WE COME WITH A HEART THAT'S OPEN WIDE
AND THE BEST OF THIS LIFE
IS ALL I EVER WANT FOR YOU
THE LOVE YOU BELIEVE IN
YOUR EVERY DREAM
YOUR EVERY PASSION
IN TIME I KNOW YOU'LL COME TO SEE
NOTHING' MEANS AS MUCH TO ME

CHORUS

THERE'LL COME A TIME WHEN YOU'LL BE
ON YOUR OWN
BUT IN YOUR HEART YOU'RE NEVER
FAR FROM HOME
EVERY ROAD YOU TAKE
YOUR EVERY LIVING DAY
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE, YOU WILL
ALWAYS BE
THE SOUL OF MY SOUL

CHORUS

SOUL OF MY SOUL, HEART OF MY HEART
SOME KIND OF MIRACLE OF LIFE
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE
BLOOD OF MY BLOOD, LIGHT OF MY LIGHT
YOU MEAN MUCH MORE THAN YOU KNOW
SOUL OF MY SOUL
