(Wait)  Oh yes wait a minute Mister Postman.
(Wait)  Wait Mister Postman.
(Postman) Mister Postman look and see.
(Oh Yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me.
I've been waiting a long long time,
since I heard from that girl of mine.

There must be some mail today
from my girl friend so far away.
Please Mister Postman look ans see
is there a letter, a letter for me.
I've been standing here waiting
Mister Postman so - o - o patiently,
for just a card or just a letter,
saying she's returning home to me.

(Postman) Mister Postman look and see.
(Oh Yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me.
I've been waiting a long long time,
since I heard from that girl of mine.

So many days you passed me by
see the tears standing in my eyes.
You didn't stop to make me feel better
by leaving me a card or a letter,

Mister Postman look and see.
(Oh Yeah) Is there a letter in your bag for me.
I've been waiting a long long time,
since I heard from that girl of mine.

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, 
oh yeah wait a minute wait a minute,
oh yeah you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute,
oh yeah check it and see one more time for me. 

You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, 
oh yeah wait a minute wait a minute,
oh yeah Mister Postman deliver the letter,
the sooner the better,

gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, 
oh yeah wait a minute wait a minute,
you gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, 
oh yeah wait a minute wait a minute,
oh yeah !
