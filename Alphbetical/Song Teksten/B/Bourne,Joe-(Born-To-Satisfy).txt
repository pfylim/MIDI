Title  : BORN TO SATISFY

(Words & music: B. Ruiter/Jos Hermeler)

Look at me
Give me a chance
I wanna know
If I've got a chance
Come to me baby, let's dance

You're so sweet
You look so nice
You're an angel from paradise
Come to me baby, let's dance

I was born to satisfy you
Baby, everything is so fine
Baby, you hold me, you take me
Unfold me and shake me
And squeeze me through the night

You shake your body
You make me lose my mind
You set my heart on fire, baby
You're out of sight
Let's take a taxi
To a better place
Where we get higher
In purple space

I was born to satisfy you
Baby, you give me so much sunshine
Baby, your love tastes like sweet wine
Baby, let's dance

You know girl, you've been sitting in that chair 
All night long, you're speaking at me and smiling
You got to get up off that chair
Come on over here, and let's dance
