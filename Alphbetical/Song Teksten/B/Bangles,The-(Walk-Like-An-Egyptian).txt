         Walk like an Egyptian                Bangles 


All the old paintings on the tombs , they do the sand dance ,
don't you know ? If they move too quick - oh whey oh  -
They 're falling down like a domino .
All the bazaar men by the Nile , they got them money on a bet .
Gold crocodiles - oh whey oh - they snap their teeth on your cigarette.
Foreign types with the hookah pipes say -
Ay oh whey oh ,ay oh whey oh -walk like an Egyptian !

The blonde waitresses take their trays , they spin around and they
cross the floor .
They've got the moves - oh whey oh -
You drop your drink then they bring you more .

All the school kids so sick of books , they like the punk and the 
metal band. When the buzzer rings - oh whey oh -
They're walking like an Egyptian.
All the kids in the market place say -
Ay oh whey oh ,ay oh whey oh - walk like an Egyptian !

Slide your feet up the street , bend your back ,shift you arm ,
then you pull it back .
Life is hard you know - oh whey oh - so strike a pose on a Cadillac.
If you want to find all the cops , they're hanging out in the donut shop. 
They sing and dance - oh whey oh - they spin the clubs cruise down
the block .
All the Japanese with their yen , the party boys call the Kremlin .
And the Chinese know - oh whey oh - they walk the line like an Egyptian.
All the cops in the donut shop say - ay oh whey oh , ay oh whey oh -
Walk like an Egyptian , walk like an Egyptian .
