Singer : THE BUGGLES
Title  : VIDEO KILLED THE RADIOSTAR

(Words & music: B. Wooley/T.Horn/G.Downes)

I heard you on the wireless back in fifty-two
Lying awake intently, turning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop coming through

They took the credit for you second symphony
Rewritten by machine on new technology
And now I understand the problem you can see
(Oh wa oh wa)
I met your children, what did you tell them?

Chorus:
Video killed the radiostar
Video killed the radiostar
Pictures came an broke your heart, oh oh oh

And now we meet in an abandoned studio
We hear the playback and it seems so long ago
And you remember the jingles used to go
(Oh wa oh wa)
You were the first one, you were the last one

Video killed the radiostar
Video killed the radiostar
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far
Pictures came and broke your heart
Put the blame on V.C.R.
You are a radiostar
You are a radiostar

Chorus: ...

Video killed the radiostar
Video killed the radiostar
Video killed the radiostar
Video killed the radiostar
