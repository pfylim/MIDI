BIG FUN - CAN'T SHAKE THE FEELING

(Words & music: Stock/Aitken/Waterman)

The minute I met you
I couldn't forget you
I knew I was falling in love
Ever since then to
See you again was
All I've been thinking of
I have found emotions
Stronger than anything

Chorus:
I can't shake the feeling (feeling)
How long will it last
I just don't know
It has to be love that I'm feeling
No no no

I wanted to know you
But how could I show you
Life has a new meaning for me
The second I saw you
I new I adored you
That's what true love should be
I have found my devotion
You are my everything

Chorus: ...

I have found emotions
Stronger than anything
