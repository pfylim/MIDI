Title  : IF I SAID YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY,WOULD YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME

(Words & music: David Bellamy)

Chorus:
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?
If I swore you were an angel
Would you treat me like the devil tonight?
If I was dying of thirst
Would your flowing love come quench me?
If I said you have a beautiful body
Would you hold it against me?

Now we could talk all night, about the weather
Could tell you 'bout my friends out on the coast
I could ask a lot of crazy questions
Or ask you what I really want to know

Chorus: ...

Now rain can fall so soft against the window
The sun can shine so bright up in the sky
But daddy always told me: Don't talk small talk
He said: Come on out and say what's on your mind

Chorus: ...
