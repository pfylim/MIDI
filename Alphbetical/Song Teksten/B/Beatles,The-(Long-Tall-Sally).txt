Gonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John,
he says he has the blues, but he has a lot of fun,
oh, baby, yes baby, woo baby, havin' me some fun tonight.

Yeah !
Well, Long Tall Sally has a lot on the ball,
and nobody cares, if she's long and tall,
oh, baby, yes baby, woo baby, havin' me some fun tonight.

Well, I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sallly,
he saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley,
oh, baby, yes baby, woo baby, havin' me some fun tonight.

Yeah !
We're gonna have some fun tonight,
gonna have some fun tonight woo !
We're gonna have some fun tonight,
evrything will be all right.
We're gonna have some fun,
gonna have some fun tonight,
