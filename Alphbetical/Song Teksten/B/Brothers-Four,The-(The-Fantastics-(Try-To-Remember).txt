12. THE FANTASTICS (TRY TO REMEMBER) - BROTHERS FOUR

Try to remember
That kind of September
When life was slow and all so mellow
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green and grain was yellow
try to remember the kind of September
When you were a tender and cuddle fellow
Try to remember and if you remember
Then follow, follow
Try to remember when (try for September)
That noone went except the willow
Try to remember the kind of September
When love was an amber of vow to willow
Try to remember and if you remember 
Then follow, follow
Deep in December is nice to remember
Although you know the snow will follow
deep in December is nice to remember 
The fire of September that made us mellow
Deep in December our hearts should remember and follow, follow, follow
