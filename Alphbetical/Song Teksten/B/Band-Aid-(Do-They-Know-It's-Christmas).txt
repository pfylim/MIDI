BAND AID - DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS?

It's christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At christmas time
We let in light
And if we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At christmas time
But say a prayer
To pray for the other ones
At christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God
It's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa
This christmas time
The greatest gift they'll
Get this year is life
Oh where nothing ever grows
No rain or river flow
Do they know it's christmas time at all?

Here's to you, raise a glass for ev'ryone
Here's to them, underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's christmas time at all?

Refrain:
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time again
