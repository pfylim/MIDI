  And I love her        Beatles


I give her all my love,
That's all I do;
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too, and I love her.

She gives me ev'rything,
And tenderly;
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me, and I love her.

A love like ours could never die,
As long as I have you near me.

Bright are the stars that shine,
Dark is the sky;
I know this love of mine
Will never die, and I love her
