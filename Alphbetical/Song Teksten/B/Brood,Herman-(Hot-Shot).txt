Singer : HERMAN BROOD
Title  : HOT SHOT

(Words & music: Herman Brood/Danny Lademacher)

I like to be in the limelight
Like to move around
Like to be on the cover
Like to push it out

Like to be in the spotlight
Want my mama to be proud
The little schoolhater is doin' fine
He's gonna be a clown

Chorus:
Be a hot shot
A show performer
Be a hot shot
A show performer
Be a hot shot

I like those good-looking ladies
See in exctasy
All those well dressed ladies
Taking care of me

I like to be taken care of
No responsibility
I like to be ...
I want to be care free
I want to be a hot shot

Chorus: ...2x...

I like to be in the movies
I like to be in the heep
I like to see my name in light
Taking off for Sunset Street

Like to sit on top of it
Like to sit on a cloud
Like to sit, like to be ...

Chorus: ...8x...
