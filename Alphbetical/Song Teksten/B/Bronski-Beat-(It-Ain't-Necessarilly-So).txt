Da ra da de ra am de
Ba ra ba am dee da am doo
Ba ra am de ba ra am de
Da ra doo dee

Refrain:
It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the bible
It ain't necessarily so

David was small but oh my
David was small but oh my
He shot Goliath
Who lay down and dieth
Little David was small but oh my

Jonah he lived in a whale
Jonah he lived in a whale
He made his home in that fishes abdomen
Jonah he lived in a whale

Moses was found on a stream
Moses was found on a stream
Floated on water old pharaoh's daughter
Fished him she says from the stream

It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
They tell all your children
The devil he's a villain
It ain't necessarily so

Refrain: ...

It ain't necessarily (6x)
It ain't necessarily so
