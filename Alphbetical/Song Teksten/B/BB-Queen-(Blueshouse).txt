Title  : Blueshouse
Singer : BB Queen


I feel the blues, everytime you leave me
I feel abused, explosions in my heart
Somebody told me you're walking with a lady
Leaving your child back in Harlem nights

Chorus:
I've got blues in my heart
Got blues in my soul
I am living in a blueshouse
I've got blues in my head
Got blues in my breath
I am living in a blueshouse

I'll take a train, the last train to Georgia
Resist the pain of a boochie coochie man
I'll slip away, far from everybody
Hee you Pappa you're a bad man to meet

Chorus

And when you come, knocking on my door
I'll be gone, into another dream
Don't feel sorry baby
I'll start all over again yeah.
