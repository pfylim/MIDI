Title  : I LOVE THE NIGHTLIFE

(Words & music: Susan Hutcheson)

Please don't talk about love tonight
Please don't talk about sweet love
Please don't talk about being true
And all the trouble we been thru
Please don't talk about all the plans
We had for fixin' this broken romance
I want to go where the people dance
I want some action
I want to live action
I've got so much to give
I want to give it
I want to get some too

Chorus:
I love the nightlife
I've got the boogie, on the disco 'round
I love the nightlife
I've got the boogie, on the disco 'round

Please don't talk about love tonight
Your sweet talk won't make it right
Lovin' lies just bring me down
When you've got women all over town
You can love them all and when you're thru
Maybe that will make a man out of you
I got to go where the people dance
I want some action, I want to live
Action, I've got so much to give
I want to give it, I want to get some too

Chorus: ...
