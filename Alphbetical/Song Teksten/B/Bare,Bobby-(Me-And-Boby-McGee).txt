
8. ME AND BOBBY MCGEE - BOBBY BARE

Busted flat in Baton Rouge, headin' for the trains;
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbled a diesel down just before it rained,
Took us all the way to New Orleans.
I took an harpoon out of my dirty, red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin'time and Bobby clappin' hands
We finly sang up ev'ry song that driver knew.

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues.
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby Mc Gee, from the Gee.
