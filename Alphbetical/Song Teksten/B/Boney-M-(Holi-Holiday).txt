There's a place I know where we should go
Hidihidiho
Won't you take me there, your lady fair
Hidihidiho
There's a brook nearby, the grass grows high
Hidihidiho
And we both can hide side by side
Hidihidiho

Chorus:
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song and skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday

There's a county fair not far from there
Hidihidiho
On the carrousel's a ding dong bell
Hidihidiho
On the loop-di-loop we'd swing and swoop
Hidihidiho
And what else we'll do is up to you
Hidihidiho

Chorus: ...

Well I'm game, fun is the thing I'm after
Now let's all live it up today
Get set for love and laughter
Well, let's go, time isn't here for wasting
Time is so full of sweet, sweet things
And I'd like to do some tastin'

Chorus: ...

Down the country side we take a ride
Hidihidiho
With the stars a shine and lots of time
Hidihidiho
Back of your old car we might get far
Hidihidiho
In the summer breeze we'll feel at ease
Hidihidiho

Chorus: ...
