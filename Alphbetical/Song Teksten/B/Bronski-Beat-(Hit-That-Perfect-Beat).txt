BRONSKI BEAT - HIT THAT PERFECT BEAT

Searching for some company
Feel the rhythm, dance with me
Them beat boy blues seem out of space
Now they want the party pace, party pace
Dance, dance on the floor
Dance, dance feel some more
Dance, dance feel the heat

Hit that perfect beat boy (2x)
Boy I've got that feeling
That beat boy feeling
I've got that feeling
I've got that feeling
That perfect beat
I've got that feeling
That perfect feeling
That perfect feeling all over me
Beat boy, beat boy
Hit that perfect beat boy (4x)
Beat boy, beat boy

Come come close to me
I want this time boy
That perfect feeling all over me
Come come close to me
I want this time boy
That beat boy feeling all over me
Too close for comfort, too close for joy
Boys in the back room, their house destroy
Touch and kiss a stranger if all else fails
Hiding from the danger that's been sent from hell
