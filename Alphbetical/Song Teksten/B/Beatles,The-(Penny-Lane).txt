  10. PENNY LANE (THE BEATLES)
  
  
  PENNY LANE: THERE IS A BARBER SHOWING PHOTOGRAPHS
  OF EVERY HEAD HE'S HAD THE PLEASURE TO KNOW.
  AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT COME AND GO STOP AND SAY HELLO.
  
  ON THE CORNER IS A BANKER WITH A MOTOR CAR.
  THE LITTLE CHILDREN LAUGH AT HIM BEHIND HIS BACK.
  AND THE BANKER NEVER WEARS A MAC IN THE POURING RAIN,
  VERY STRANGE.
  
  PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES.
  THERE BENEATH THE BLUE SUBURBAN SKIES
  I SIT AND MEANWHILE
  
  BACK IN PENNY LANE THERE IS A FIREMAN WITH AN HOUR GLASS.
  AND IN HIS POCKET IS A PORTRAIT OF THE QUEEN.
  HE LIKES TO KEEP HIS FIRE ENGINE CLEAN,
  IT'S A CLEAN MACHINE.
  
  PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES.
  FULL OF FISHES AND FINGER PIES IN SUMMER MEANWHILE
  
  BACK BEHIND THE SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROUNDABOUT
  THE PRETTY NURSE IS SELLING POPPIES FROM A TRAY
  AND THOU' SHE FEELS AS IF SHE'S IN A PLAY
  SHE IS ANYWAY
  
  IN PENNY LANE: THE BARBER SHAVES ANOTHER CUSTOMER.
  WE SEE THE BANKER SITTING, WAITING FOR A TRIM.
  AND THEN THE FIREMAN RUSHES IN FROM THE POURING RAIN,
  VERY STRANGE.
  
  PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES.
  THERE BENEATH THE BLUE SUBURBAN SKIES.
  I SIT AND MEANWHILE BACK:
  
  PENNY LANE IS IN MY EARS AND IN MY EYES.
  THERE BENEATH THE BLUE SUBURBAN SKIES,
  PENNY LANE
