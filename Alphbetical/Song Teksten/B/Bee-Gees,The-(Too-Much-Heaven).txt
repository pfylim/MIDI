Singer : BEE GEES 
Title  : TOO MUCH HEAVEN

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/ Maurice Gibb/Robin Gibb)

Chorus:
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come there
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain, and harder to climb

You and me girl
Got a lot of loving stars
And it flows through you and it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Than my life
I can see the operator
Everything we own will never die

Love ain't such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Oh you're just a dream, to fade away

Chorus: ...

You and me girl
Got a highway to the stars
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears we had to cry
You're my love

I can see it neutral
Everything we own will never die

Love ain't such a beautiful thing
When you are to me
The light above
Made for all to see
My precious love

Chorus: ...

Love ain't such a beautiful thing
When you are to me
The light above
Made for all to see
My precious love

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come there,
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river, and harder to rime

Chorus: ...
