     B L A C K   I S   B L A C K

         Black is black
         I want my baby back
         It's grey , it's grey
         Since she went away o - o        

         What can I do
         'Cause I , I'm feeling blue
         If I had my way
         She'd be back today
         But she don't intend
         To see me again o - o
  
         What can I do
         'Cause I , I'm feeling blue
         I can't choose
         It's to much to lose
         My love's too strong
         May be if she
         Would come back to me
         Then it can't go wrong
       
         Black is black, . . . . . . .

         What can I do
         'Cause I , I'm feeling blue
         'Cause I , I'm feeling blue
