Singer : BACCARA 
Title  : DARLIN'

(Words & music: Rolf Sojo/Frank Dostal)

Postcards from Amsterdam
Phonecalls from Birmingham
To tell me only how you miss me
Received your telegram
Now you say: here I am
The way you hold me and kiss me

Oh,
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
Leave a little love for later on
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
So that you can come back when you've gone
I idolize your magic eyes
And I imagine all the cooching we will do

Oh,
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
Leave a little secret on the shore
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
So that you can come again for more
My fantasy runs fancy free
And I imagine all the cooching we will do

It's been a long time
And you and me will climb
The mountains and the hills of passion
Soft satin skin to skin
Oh, what a mood I'm in
Bewitched by warm aggression
