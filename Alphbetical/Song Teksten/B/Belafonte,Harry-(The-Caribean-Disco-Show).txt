This is my island in the sun                          
where my people have toiled since time begun           
I may sail on many a  sea                              
her shores will always be home for me                  
Oh island in the sun                                   
built to me by my fathers hand                         
all my days I will sing and pray                       
of your forests, waters and shining sand  (..Fl”te)

Coconut woman is calling mountain                     
and every day you can hear her shout

Got your coconutta water (coconut)                     
man is good for your daughter --                       
coconutta nutta iron --                                
this is strong like a lion --                          
                                                      
Down the way where the nights are grey          
where the sun shines daily on the mountain top   
I took a trip on a sailing ship                  
and when I reached Jamaika I made a stop         
San Jos‚ is on my way                            
won't be back for many a days                    
my heart is down, my head is turning around      
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston-town    

Solo                                    

Day - O  ...

Angelina, Angelina, please bring out your Concertina and
play a welcome for me
because I'm coming home from sea (I said)
Angelina ...
