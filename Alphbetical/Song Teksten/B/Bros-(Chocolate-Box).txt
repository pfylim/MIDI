BROS - CHOCOLATE BOX

(Words & music: Goss/Graham)

You're taking candy from the jar
You spin the lid, which one first
Desert of temptation
What soda will quench this thirst

Don't wanna be left behind
The grass is always greener
On the other side
So don't you treat me like the first

Chorus:
Chocolate in the box
I know you'll take another
What you want is a looker not a lover
In the box
Cos I know you'll take another
What you want is a looker
Not a lover, I've discovered

You want your cake and eat it
With a silver spoon in your hand
Don't give me that
Innocent girl thing
Cos I'll close the door with a slam

Don't wanna be left behind
The grass is always greener
On the other side
So don't you treat me like the first

Chorus: ...5x...

Oh, what you want, yeah
