Title  : LOVE YOU INSIDE OUT

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Maurice Gibb/Robin Gibb)

Baby I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you trying to do?
Livin' on your cheating 
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever, but you're driving me insane
And I'm hanging on, oh

Oh, I'll win, I'll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

Chorus:
I ain't no vision, I'm the man who loves you
Inside and out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do, if we lose the fire

Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm

Chorus: ...

Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a line
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside
You are the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle, I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

Chorus: ...
