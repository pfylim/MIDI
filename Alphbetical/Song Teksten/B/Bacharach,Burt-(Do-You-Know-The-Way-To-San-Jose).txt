Do you know the way to San Jose ?
I've been away so long;
I may go wrong and lose my way.
Do you know the way to San Jose ?
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.
L.A. is a great big freeway.
Put a hundred down and buy a car.
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star.
Weeks turn into years;
How quick they pass,
and all the stars that never were
are parking cars and pumping gas.

You can really breathe in San Jose.
They've got a lot of space;
There'll be a place where I can stay.
I was born and raised in San Jose.
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.
Fame and fortune is a magnet;
It can pull you far away from home.
With a dream in your heart
you're never alone.
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
and there you are, without a friend.
You pack your car and ride away.
I've got lots of friends in San Jose.
Do you know the way to San Jose ?
Can't wait to get back to San Jose.
