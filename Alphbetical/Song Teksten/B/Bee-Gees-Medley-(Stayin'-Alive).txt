10. Bee Gees Medley: Stayin' Alive/Tragedy/Nights On Broadway/Night Fever/Jive Talkin'

Ah ah ah ah staying alive staying alive
Ah ah ah ah staying alive staying alive
Ah ah ah ah staying alive staying alive
Ah ah ah ah staying alive.

Life and hate has burning down inside of me
Burning love with yearning that won't let me be
Down I go I just can't take it
All alone I really should be holding you
Holding you loving you loving you.

Tragedy
When the feeling's gone and you can't go on
It's tragedy
When the morning comes and you don't know why
It's hard to be with no one to love you
You're going nowhere.

Tragedy
When you loose control and you've got no soul
It's tragedy
When the morning comes and you don't know why
It's hard to be with no one beside you
You're going nowhere.

Here we are in a room full of strangers
Standing in the dark where your eyes couldn't see me
Well I had to follow you though you did not want me to 
Come on stop my loving you
I can't send you away.

Living it on living it on
On the grounds of Broadway
Smoother than love songs
Smoother than straight through the heart songs.

Living it on
On the grounds of Broadway
Smoother than sweet songs
To that crazy crazy town.

Through the night fever night fever
We know how to do it
Through the night fever night fever
We know how to show it.

Here I am
Waiting for this moment to last
Beating on the music so fine
Born on the wind
Thinking its mine.

Through the night fever night fever
We know how to do it
Through the night fever night fever
We know how to show it.

Jive talkin'
You're telling your lies yeah
Good lovin' still gets in your eyes
Nobody believes what you say
Jive talkin' that gets in your way.
