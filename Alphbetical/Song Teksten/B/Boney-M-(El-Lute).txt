EL LUTE - BONEY M.


   This is the story of El Lute
   A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal
   Because he was poor
   But he refused to accept his fate
   And today his honor has been restored

He was only nineteen
And was sentenced to die
For something that somebody else did
And blamed on El Lute
Then they changed it to life
And so he could escape
From then on they chased him
And searched for him day and night
All over Spain
But the search was in vain for El Lute

   He had only seen the dark side of life
   The man They called El Lute
   And he wanted a home just like you and like me
   In a country were all would be free

So he taught himself to read and to write
It didn't help El Lute
He was one who had dared to escape
Over night
They had to find El Lute
Soon the fame of his name
Spread like wildfire all over the land
With a price on his head
People still gave him bread
And they gave a hand him
For they knew he was right
And his fight was their fight
No one gave you a chance
In the Spain of those days
On walls every place they had put up
The face of El Lute
And he robbed where he could
Just like once Robin Hood
They finally caught him and that seemed the end
But they caught him in vain
'Cause a change came for Spain
And El Lute
   Refrain:He had only seen the dark side of life
   The man They called El Lute
   And he wanted a home just like you and like me
   In a country were all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land
And also to El Lute

Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day
The man they called El Lute
   He had only seen the dark side of life
   The man They called El Lute
   And he wanted a home just like you and like me
   In a country were all would be free
And then freedom really came to his land
And also to El Lute
Now he walks in the light of a sunny new day
The man they called El Lute
