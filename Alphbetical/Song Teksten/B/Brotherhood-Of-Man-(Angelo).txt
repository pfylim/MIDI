Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : ANGELO

(Words & music: Tony Hiller/Martin Lee/Lee Sheridan)

Long ago, high on a mountain in Mexico
Lived a young shepherd boy Angelo
Met a young girl and he loved her so

Rich was she came from a very high family
Angelo knew it could never be
They ran away to their destiny

Refrain:
Running away from danger
Running from every stranger
Angelo
They knew it wasn't wrong
They found a love so strong
They took their lives that night
And in the morning light
They found them on the sand
They saw them lying there hand in hand
