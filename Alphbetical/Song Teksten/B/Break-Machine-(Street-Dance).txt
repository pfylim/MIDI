BREAK MACHINE - STREET DANCE

Everywhere that you may go
We're jamming in the street
All the people that you meet
Dance to the beat
If you come to New York City
You'll never be the whack
When you see us city kids
Spinning on our backs

I like the way he does that dance
When he glides across the floor
You know it really blows my mind
I always yell for more
I can't believe the things I see
Like diving on the ground
Then he's standing on his head
And grooving to the sound

Refrain:
Now just let your body move
(street dance street dance)
Put your feet into the groove
(street dance street dance)
When you feel your body shake
(street dance street dance)
Then you know you've got to break

All the people that we know
Are rocking on the one
On the corner of chi-town
They're breakdancing for fun
At the nightclubs in L.A.
Their master mix is on
On the sidewalks of Detroit
They're popping all night long

Refrain: ...

Everywhere that you may go ...etc...
