Singer : BABE 
Title  : PLEASE ME, PLEASE DO

(Words & music: Peter Koelewijn)

You're acting like a movie star
With your friends at the bar
Watching all that dancing at the floor
And it's every time the same, every weekend
Now I know your little secret
That's for sure
While you're watching all the girls
Dancing by
I know, boy of my dreams, you're too shy

Chorus:
Please me, please do
Then will I please you
Come along sugar baby, don't be blue
Please me, please do
Then will I please you
Tell ye that I like it
And you'll like it too

Su-su-su-sugar baby
Ooh ooh
Su-su-su-sugar honey
Aah aah

I see it boy
You miss the flair
And I admit that you don't care
To ask a girl like me for a dance
That's the reason why I wanna help you
Here I am, come and take a chance
Stop watching all the girls dancing by
Look at me, or are you still too shy

Chorus: ...

You think it can be nice
I read that in your eyes
Come along now and take my advice

Chorus: ...

Su-su-su-sugar baby
Ooh ooh
Su-su-su-sugar honey
Aah aah

Chorus: ...

Tell ye that I like it
And you'll like it too

Chorus: ...2x...
