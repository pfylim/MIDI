Title  : LOVE ME LIKE I LOVE YOU

Do you love me like I love you
Or is this goodbye, bye, bye,bye

I should have know better than to fall in love with you
Well I guess I'll spend my whole life loving you
One kiss so warm and tender, one kiss and I
Surrender my love for you forever more

But do you love me like I love you baby
Say you'll always love me ooh, like I love you
And do you need me, like I need you baby
You know that I'll always be in love with you

I should have known better than to give my heart away
Will I learn true love will always turn its head
Your love can last forever you know we'd be together
Sharing our love forever more

But do you love me like I love you baby
Say you'll always love me ooh, like I love you
And do you need me, like I need you baby
You know that I'll always be in love with you
