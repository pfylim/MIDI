BOOM BOOM MANCINI - RED SKIES

Good evening
Are you new at the trade?
At least I haven't met you before
Join the crowd that tries to get it made
All looking for a big deal to score
The nights are lonely
For a man on the road
You see the family once a week and years go by
Increasing the load it's hard life so to speak

Mmm, but red skies of love is what I see
A heavenly sound is what I hear red skies of love
For you and me, yeah yeah

Refrain:
(Red skies of love)
(Red skies of love)

Well you know I'm a traveling man
There's not one town I don't know
I got the job by accident
It's the money that makes me go
Hotelroom after hotelroom
I must have seen 'em all
Never a first class treatment
For the expenses that I've got

Mmm, but red skies of love is what I see
A heavenly sound is what I hear red skies of love
For you and me, wohwhowoh

Refrain:
(Red skies of love, red skies of love)
(Red skies of love, red skies of love)

Red skies of love
Red skies of love

How're you doing
Heard you're new at the trade
At least I haven't met you before
But join the crowd that tries to get it made
All looking for a big deal to score
The nights are lonely
For a man on the road
You see the family once a week and years're going by
Increasing the load it's hard life to speak


Mmm, but red skies of love is what I see
A heavenly sound is what I hear red skies of love
For you and me, wohwhowoh

Refrain: ...(3x)...

(Red skies of love, red skies of love)
(Red skies of love, red skies of love)

Ahahaha-oh...
