BOSTON - AMANDA

Babe, tomorrow's so far away
There's something I just have to say
I don't think I could hide
What I'm feeling inside
Another day, woman I love you

And I, I'm getting too close again
I don't wanna see it end
If I'll tell you tonight
Would you turn out the light
Walk away, woman I love you

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna set it like a man
I think you'll understand, Amanda

I love you

And, I feel like today's the day
I'm looking for the words to say
Do you wanna be free
Are you ready for me
To feel this way, I don't wanna lose you

So, it's maybe too soon I know
The feeling takes so long to grow
If I tell you today
Will you turn me away
And let me go
I don't want to lose you

(solo)

I'm gonna take you by surprise
And make you realize, Amanda
I'm gonna tell you right away
I can't wait another day, Amanda
I'm gonna set it like a man
I think you'll understand, Amanda

Oh, girl

You and I, I know that we can break
And I swear, I swear it's not a lie girl
Tomorrow may be too late
You, you and I girl, we can share a life together
It's now or never, and tomorrow may be too late
Oh-ooh-oh-ooh-oh

And, feeling the way I do
I don't wanna wait my whole life through
To say I'm in love with you
