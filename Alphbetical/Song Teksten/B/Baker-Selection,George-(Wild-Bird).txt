Singer : GEORGE BAKER SELECTION 
Title  : WILD BIRD

(Words & music: J. Bouwens)

Let me sing this song for you
And let me be your star
Every time I look into your eyes
I am really far
Never knowing what to say
And knowing what to do
All the good things in my life
Are just a part of you

you are just a wild bird playing in the silver sky
I am a tree that waits for you to let you rest a while
You can hide here if you want, for winter storm and snow
In the shelter of my arms, you let your feelings show

So sweet little wild bird, want you sing this song with me
Together we shall sing in perfect tune and harmony
But if you stay alone, yes in the winter you must die
Yes, I will teach you how to walk, you teach me how to fly
