The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cry

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy, when skies are grey
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take me my sunshine away

I'll always love you, and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me, and love another
You shattered all my dreams

Refrain

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else dear could some between
But now you've left me, and love another
You'll regret it all some day

Refrain
