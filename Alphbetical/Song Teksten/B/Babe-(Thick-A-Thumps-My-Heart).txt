Title  : THICK-A-THUMPS MY HEART
Artist : BABE

(Words & music: Hans van Hemert)

The skies are blue, there's no rain due
The sun is here to stay
Eight o'clock in the morning
This gonna be the day
I always will remember
It won't go out of my mind
The sun, the sky, no reason why
I won't tell you the news

A little bit of brandy
It'll help me get the nerve
To tell you that I love you
Is there anyone to serve

Chorus: ...

Thick a thups my heart
Where am I gonna start
What am I to do
Given the fact that I'm so blue
I'll have another brandy
It's gonna help me through

It's five o'clock a heavy rock
Is right behind the front
La la la la
It's raining cats and dogs
I just can't remember how it all began
The rain, the sky, the reason why
The what, the who I am

The little bit of brandy
Didn't help me get the nerve
To tell you that I love you
Is there anyone to serve

Chorus: ...
