BANANARAMA - ROUGH JUSTICE

The young don't grow up
Well not in this life
Big mouths and money
Win every time
Boy beats girl
While the sneaky and snide
Take all your money
Take your pride

Refrain:
Innocent people walking by
No time to smile before they die
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Another one disappearing every week
Don't call that justice

King for a day
But their kingdom grows cold
They'll never grow up
But they're bound to grow old
I remember the pain and humiliation
And I'll show them rough justice
The way that they did

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Innocent people walking by
Don't call that justice
Children are starving on the street
Don't call that justice (justice)
