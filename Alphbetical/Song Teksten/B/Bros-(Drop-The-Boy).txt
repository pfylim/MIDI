DROP THE BOY - BROS


I get down to dry my hair
with a little touch of gel
i read all the newspapers
but my bother still reads my mail
i won't wish my lif away
so fell me if you can
who decides when i'm grown up
and turned into a man

Refrain:
   Drop the boy drop the boy i'm a man yes i am
   but they still call me boy
   drop the boy drop the boy i'm a man yes i am
   and i'll be jumping for joy

When they drop the boy
when they drop the boy

I'm tired of the boy thing
i've got other things to do
i'd like to be in politics
can't take another visit to the zoo
no more bikes or plastic
models and braces on my teeth
i'd like to drive a dino 
and to live out of my reach

Refrain:

Drop the boy drop the boy i'm a man yes i am
Drop the boy drop the boy i'm a man yes i am
here's no compassion
All your warmth is gone
Tell me how oh how can I keep holding on
