Title  : TIRED OF TOEIN' THE LINE

(Words & music: Rocky Burnette)

Chorus:
Baby, I'm tired of toein' the line
Don't know why you want to jump on me
Baby, baby, baby and make me cry

Baby, I, I'm gonna find myself someone new
Someone who will be true
And no more toein' the line

I know it's over 'cause I've seen the signs
Don't let me waste your precious time

Baby I'm tired of toein' the line
If you wanna get rid of me
Baby, baby, baby you're doin' fine
I'm gonna put on my walking shoes
And leave you far behind

You're rollin' over in clover, so define
But you can't fix this broken heart of mine

Chorus: ...

Baby I'm tired of toein' the line (3x)
