3. FOREVER LOVE - GARY BARLOW

Love it has so many beautiful faces.
Sharing lives and sharing days.
My love it had so many empty spaces
Iïm sharing them with you now,
I hope thatïs how it stays.

Now I`m deep inside love
And still breathing,
She is holding my heart in her hands.
And the closest Iïve been to believing.
This could be love forever.
All through out my life 
Two reasons Iïve demanded
But how can I reason
With the reason I have

Oh ooh

And Iïm leaning on me to support her
And I know that Iïll go cold as stone.
As she leaves it gets harder and harder
To face life alone.
Now my dreams are fulfilled 
At times when we`re together
Guess what I need from her
Is forever love.

Ooh ooh yeah 
Ooooh hmm
Oh oh yeah
My dream forever
Uuh
Oh yeah
My dream
