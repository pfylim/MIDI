Freeze, I'm Ma Baker, put your hands in the air
Gimme all your money
This is the story of Ma Baker
The meanest cat of all Chicago town

She was the meanest cat, in all Chicago town
She was the meanest cat, she really mowed the town
She had no heart at all, no no no heart at all
She was the meanest cat, oh, she was really tough
She left her husband flat, he wasn't tough enough
She took her boys along, 'cause they were mean and strong

Refrain:
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma Baker she taught her poor sons
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma Baker to handle their guns
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma Baker she never could cry
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma Baker but she knew how to die

They left a train of crime across the USA
And when one boy was killed, she really made them pay
She had no heart at all, no no no heart at all

Refrain: ...

And then the man she liked
She thought she'd stay with him
When they had formed a band, they did away with him
She didn't care at all, just didn't care at all

Here is a special bulletin:
Ma Baker is the FBI's most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station

Don't anybody move, the money or your lives

One day they robbed a bank
This was their last parade
The cops were near to soon
They couldn't get away
They got the loot they had
It made their minds too mad
And so they shouted on
Ma Baker and her sons
They didn't want to hang
They died with raising guns
And so the story ends

Refrain: ...
