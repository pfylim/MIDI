Title  : THE LAST APACHE

(Words & music: Rob Bolland/Ferdy Bolland)

He was just a boy, they called him Rising Sun
He grew proud and strong
The sound of ancient songs
Ringing in his ears
For oh so many years

Now he is grown a man
The music dies
Just hear the sound of battle cries
Hear the shooting guns
The soldier rides, the indian runs

Ride on Indian soldier
You want to be free
Give him back his country
He's the last apache, the last apache

Hear the distant drums
They're fighting their last
It ended overnight
He gave his life in vain
Rising Sun won't shine again

Ride on Indian soldier
You want to be free
Give him back his country
He's the last apache, the last apache

Once the indians were free to live
In their own country
Then came the white man, he took away
Their land and only one of them survived
He is the last apache
