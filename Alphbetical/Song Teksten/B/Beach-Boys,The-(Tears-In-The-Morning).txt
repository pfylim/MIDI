            Tears in the morning

            Ain't gonna tell me what to do
                   Dm             Fmaj6               G 
            No no those tears, I know they're just a warning
              C       Em              Am

              D              Fism                     Bm  
            You packed your warmth and you took your soul
             Dm      F                          G    
            Well I hope you do what you're damn sure of
             C         Em                 Am  
            A lonely bed here takes on a cold
             Em                                      A  
            Lose a wife, change my life, we're not together
                D        Fism             Bm   
            A cancelled future, but it's hard on me
             Dm    Fmaj6              G    
            Gone, gone, are you gone forever
             C                 Em                 Am   
            Hope you'll love a baby I never gonna see
