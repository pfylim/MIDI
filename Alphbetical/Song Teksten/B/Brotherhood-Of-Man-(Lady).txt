Singer : BROTHERHOOD OF MAN 
Title  : LADY 
 
I know that it was wrong of me 
To buy your hospitality 
But baby what else can I do 
There's no other way to get through to you 
I just gotta set you free 
Out of this house of misery 
 
Refrain: 
Lady lady my lady be my lady 
Love me tonight 
Lady lady my lady be my lady 
Make everything right 
 
They say that he's the one to blame 
He led you to the house of shame 
To sell your favor for a price 
And you know baby that ain't so nice 
Gonna lift you from the gloom 
And take you from this back street room 
 
Refrain: ... 
 
And the past will be a bad dream 
To me you'll always be a queen 
 
Refrain: ...
