  4. I GET AROUND - BEACH BOYS
  
  Round round 
  Get around
  I get around (yeah)
  Get around (round round) ooh
  I get around
  
  I get a round       (Get around round round round I get around) 
  Right 'round the town   (Get around round round I get around)
  I take a look up here       (Get around round I get around)
  I take a look up there      (Get around round round I get around)
  
  I'm getting bugged 
  Driving up and down the same old strip
  I've got to find a new place
  Where the kids are hip.
  
  My buddies and me are getting real well known
  Yeah, the bad guys know us
  And they leave us alone.
  
  I get a round       (Get around round round round I get around) 
  Right 'round the town   (Get around round round I get around)
  I take a look up here       (Get around round I get around)
  I take a look up there      (Get around round round I get around)
  
  I get around    (Round round get around round round).
  Ooh wawaooh...
  
  We always take my car 
  'Cause it's never been beat
  And we've never missed yet
  With the girls we meet.
  
  None of the guys go steady
  'Cause it wouldn't be right
  To leave the best girl at home
  On a Saturday night.
  
  I get a round       (Get around round round round I get around) 
  Right 'round the town   (Get around round round I get around)
  I take a look up here       (Get around round I get around)
  I take a look up there      (Get around round round I get around)
