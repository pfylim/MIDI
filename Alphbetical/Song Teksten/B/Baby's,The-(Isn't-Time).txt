Title  : ISN'T IT TIME

(Words & music: Conrad/Kennedy)

Falling in love was the last thing I had on my mind
Holding you is the warmth that I thought I could never find
Sitting here all alone
Just trying to decide
Whether to go on alone
Or stay by your side
Then I stop myself to cry
I know I could try
I just can't find the answer to the question
That keeps going through my mind
Isn't it time

Chorus:
This is your life, it's your time to wait
Falling in love could be your mistake
Isn't it time
This is your life, it's your time to wait
Falling in love could be your mistake

I have seen visions of someone like you in my life
A love so strong reaching out holding me through
The darkest night
Sitting here all alone
Just trying to decide
Whether to go on alone
Or stay by your side
Then I stop myself because
I don't want to cry
I just can't find the answer to the question
That keeps going through my mind
Isn't it time

Chorus: ...

I feel a warmth in my heart and my soul that I never knew
This love affair gives me strength that I need just
To get me through
Sitting here all alone
Just wandering why
Then I stop myself because
I know I could cry
Then I think of you
Everything seems alright
'Cause I've finally found the answer to the question
That keeps going through my mind

Isn't it time
Baby this time you don't have to wait
Loosing this love could be your mistake
Isn't it time
Baby this time you don't have to wait
Loosing this love could be your mistake

Chorus: ...
