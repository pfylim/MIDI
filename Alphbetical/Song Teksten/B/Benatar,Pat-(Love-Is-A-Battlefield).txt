PAT BENATAR - LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD

We are young, heartache to heartache
We stand, no promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield, oh-ooh-oh
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

You're beggin' me to go
Then makin' me stay
Why do you hurt me so bad?
It would help me to know
Do I stand in your way
Or am I the best thing you've had?
Believe me, believe me
I can't tell you why
But I'm trapped by your love
And I'm chained to your, side

We are young, heartache to heartache
We stand, no promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield

When I'm losin' control
Will you turn me away
Or touch me deep inside?
And when all this get old
Will it still feel the same?
There's no way this will die
But if we get much closer
I could lose control
And if your heart surrenders
You'll need me to hold

We are young, heartache to heartache
We stand, no promises, no demands
Love is a battlefield
We are strong
No one can tell us we're wrong
Searchin' our hearts for so long
Both of us knowing
Love is a battlefield
