Title  : BLEW MY COOL OVER YOU
Artist : HERMAN BROOD

(Words & music: A. Alberts)

Wanted to knock on your door
In the middle of the night
Wanted to talk a little more
And hold you tight
Don't you know, honey
What you're doing to me?
I am crazy about you, baby
This ain't the way to be

Chorus:
I blew my cool over you, don't you know?
I blew my cool over you

I made a fool of myself
Time and time again
You just sit there smiling
Put me back on the shelf
I am crazy about you
And jealous too
If you're gonna leave me
It'll break my heart in two

Chorus: ...

Sitting at home, can't get to work
I feel so alone
I just can't stand when you're talking
To strangers on the telephone

Always looking for a reason
A sign or a clue
A change in the season
To get back to you
I am crazy about you, baby
And jealous too
If you're gonna leave me
It'll break my heart in two

Chorus: ...
