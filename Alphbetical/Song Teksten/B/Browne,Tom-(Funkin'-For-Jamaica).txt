Title  : FUNKIN' FOR JAMAICA
Artist : TOM BROWNE

(Words & music: Tom Browne/Tom Smith)

Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Let it get into you
Come on, I've got a groove
(You know where I'll be)

Funkin' for Jamaica if you feel it
Let it get into you
Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Babe, let it get into you

I feel it inside my soul
Let it get into you
'Cause there's enough to go all the way around
Ah, let it get into you
This feeling's funk, that's what it is
Let it get in to you
Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Funkin' for Jamaica
If you feel it, let it get into you
Jamaica funk, that's what it is
Babe, let it get into you
