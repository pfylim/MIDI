I'm born again, I feel free
No longer alone
A bright light is shining
And shows me a world that I own
I can see my way through
I know I will beside you
All those prayers of mine were'nt in vain
I'm born again
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm born again, I feel free
There's a quite different me
No longer I'm tossed like a ship
On an unruly sea
I've been blessed with a love
That's meant for the rest of my time
All thoseprayers they were not in vain
'Cause I'm born again
--------------------------------------------------------
Since love touched my heart right
My life has a meaning
I feel I'm no longer drifting in space
I believe once again that is a tomorrow
A brandnew tomorrow, I knew I can face
I'm born again, thanks to you
I roll with the tide
I float with the breeze
No longings are hidden inside
And I shouted out loud
I know now what life is about
All those prayers of mine were'nt in vain
'Cause I'm born again
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm born again, I feel free
No longer alone
A bright light is shining
And shows me a world that I own
I can see my way through
I know I will beside you
All those prayers of mine were'nt in vain
'Cause I'm born again
