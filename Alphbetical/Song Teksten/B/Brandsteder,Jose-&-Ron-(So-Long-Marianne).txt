JOSE & RON BRANDSTEDER - SO LONG MARIANNE

Come over to the window, my little darling
I'd like to read your palm
I used to think I was some sort of gypsy boy
Before I let you take me home

Refrain:
Now, so long Marianne, it's time that we began
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh
About it all again

Well, you know that I love to live with you
But you make me forget so very much
I forget to pray for the angel
And then the angels forget to pray for us
