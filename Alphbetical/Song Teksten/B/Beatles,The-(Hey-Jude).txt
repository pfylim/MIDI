9. HEY JUDE - BEATLES

Hey Jude, don't make it badTake a sad song and make it betterRemember to let her into your heartThen you do start to make it betterHey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin.
Then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain.
Hey Jude refrain.
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
Well you know that it's a foolWho plays it coolBy making his world a little colderDa da da da daDa da da daHey Jude don't let me down.
But you have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let get into your heartThen you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in.
Hey Jude begin.
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you.
Hey Jude, you'll do.
The movement you need is on your shoulder.
Da da da da daDa da da da Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin.
Then you begin to make it betterBetter, better, better, better, better, ohDa, da da da da da daDa da da da, hey Jude.
