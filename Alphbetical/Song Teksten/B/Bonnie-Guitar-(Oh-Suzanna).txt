I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee,
I'm going to Louisiana my Susanna for to see.

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh, Susanna oh, don't you cry for me.
For I'm goin' to Louisiana with my banjo on my knee.
----------------------------------------------------

It rained all night, the day I left, the weather it was dry,
the sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna don't you cry !

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh,...
----------------------------------------------------

I had a dream the other night, when ev'rything was still,
Ithought I saw Susanna dear acoming down the hill.

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh,...
----------------------------------------------------

The buckwheat cake was in her mouth, the tear was in her eye,
I said I'm coming from the south, Susanna don't you cra !

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh,...
----------------------------------------------------

I soon will be in New Orleans and then I'll look around
and when I find Susanna, I'll fall upon the ground.

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh,...
----------------------------------------------------

But if I do not find her then I'm surely bound to die
and when I'm dead and burried, oh Susanna, don't you cry !

Refrain:
----------------------------------------------------
Oh,...
----------------------------------------------------
