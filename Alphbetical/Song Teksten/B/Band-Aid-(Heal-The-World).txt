  There's a place in your heart and I know that it is love

  And the place is much brighter than tomorrow

  And if you really try you'll find there's no need to cry

  And this place tells you there's no hurt or sorrow

  
  There are, ways to get there if you care enough for the living

  Make a little space, to make a beter place

  
  
  HEAL THE WORLD, MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE

  FOR YOU AND FOR ME AND THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE

  THERE ARE, PEOPLE DYING IF YOU CARE ENOUGH FOR THE LIVING

  MAKE A BETTER PLACE FOR YOU AND FOR ME

  If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie

  Love is strong and only cares for joy for giving

  If you try you shall see,in this bliss we cannot fill

  There are thrills that stop existing and start living

  And it feels that always love's enough for it's growing

  Make a better world,to make a better world

  
  REFREIN

  AND THE DREAM WE WERE CONCEIVED, WILL BE FILLED WITH JOY AND FACE

  AND THE WORLD WE ONCE BELIEVED IN WILL SHINE AGAIN IN GRACE

  Then why do we keep strangling then this earth comes to fy its soul
