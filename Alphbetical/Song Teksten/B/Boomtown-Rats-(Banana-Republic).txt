Title  : BANANA REPUBLIC
Artist : BOOMTOWN RATS

(Words & music: Briquette/Geldoff)

Chorus:
Banana Republic, septic issue
Screaming in the suffering sea
It sounds like crying
Everywhere I go (you know)
Everywhere I see the black and blue uniforms
Police and priests

And I wonder, do you woinder
While you're sleeping with your whore
That sharing beds with history
Is like a-licking running sores
Forty shades of green, yeah, sixty shades of red
Heroes going cheap these days
Price a bullet in the head, Banana Republic

Chorus: ...

Take your hand and lead you up a garden path
Let me stand aside here and watch you pass
Striking up a soldier's song, another tune
It begs too many questions and answers too

Chorus: ...

The purple and the pinstripe
They mutely shake their heads
A silence, shrinking volumes
A violence worse than they condemn
Stab you in the back, yeah
Laughing in your face
Glad to see the place again
It's a pity nothing's changed

Chorus: ...
