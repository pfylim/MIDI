Girl, if you did not exist
I wouldn't know how wonderful
It can be to be loved and to feel
Someone is always by my side.

Girl, if you did not exist
Then I'd create you in my dreams
Like an elf through the still of the night
You'd fly and celebrate a rite
To make this dream come true.

Girl, if you did not exist
I wouldn't know that love can mend
All the pain deep inside that we share
Life would be so hard to bear.

Girl, if you did not exist
I couldn't sing this song for you
There is love burning deep in my heart
Life won't tear its love apart
I'll never ever let you go.

Girl, if you did not exist
I wouldn't know that love can mend
All the pain deep inside of a man
Life would be an empty hell.

Girl, if you did not exist
I couldn't sing this song for you
There is love burning deep in my heart
Life won't tear its love apart
I'll never ever let you go.

Ooh...
