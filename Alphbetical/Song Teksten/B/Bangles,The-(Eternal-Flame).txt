  ETERNAL FLAME - THE BANGLES

  
  Close your eyes
  Give me your hand, darling
  Do you feel my heart beating?
  Do you understand?
  Do you feel the same?
  Am I only dreaming?
  Is this burning an eternal flame?
  
  I believe it's meant to be, darling (ooh...)
  I watch you when you are sleeping
  You belong with me
  Do you feel the same?
  Am I only dreaming?
  Or is this burning (burning) an eternal flame?
  
  Say my name (ah)
  Sun shines through the rain
  Your whole life so lonely
  I will come and ease the pain
  I don't want to lose this feeling, oh (oh, ah).
