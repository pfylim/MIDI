Spaceman
I always wanted you to go into space
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go into space
I just spuriously come to make my home
Beyond the black horizon tryin to take control
See my girl she shivers in her bones
The sun incentives rising trying to take us all
There's a fire between us
So where is your god
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off this world
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go into space
Smirking germans hate the great white world
Morbid fashinations
Television takes control
Declamation different races fall
Electronic information tempers with your soul
There's a fire between us
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off the carousel
I can't get off this world
The city tastes of atomic jokes
Images of fascist popes
Beam me up 'cause I can't win
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go into space
Spaceman
I always wanted you to go into space
Spaceman Spaceman Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
Spaceman
