Title  : MANANA

(Words & music: J. Bouwens)

When the silent shadows gonna fall
When the evening breeze is gonna call
We'll sit by the table to eat our daily bread
This day was a hard day my friend

The whole day I was working on the land
While the sun was burning on my back
Yes it's a hard life to make it with your hands
Let's see what tomorrow may bring

Refrain:
Manana is another day of slaving on the fields
Manana is another day of sweating out my tears
Manana is another day of wondering just how long
Manana is the same as any other day my friend
Manana is the same as the years we worked the land
Manana, mi amor

But someday there's another rising sun
And we give them back what they have done
Someday we will stand up to scream out to the sky
Someday my ego will fly

Refrain: ...
