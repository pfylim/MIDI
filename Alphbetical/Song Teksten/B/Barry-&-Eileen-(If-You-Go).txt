Title  : IF YOU GO

If you go
I'll sit here, trying not to see how
Lonely life will be without you
If you go
I'll wait here for the phone to ring
pretending
I don't care about you
If you go
You'll think I didn't shed a tear
While deep down here my heart is dying
If you go
I'll let you walk right out the door
And then I'm sure that I'll start crying

If you go, my happiness will go with you
my life my love, what will I do
I can't go on without love and all my
love goes with you

If you go, I'll take your picture from the wall
And tell my friends that it was all
A little game but just the same, I'll still
be sad if you go

If you go
I'll meet my friends and take a drink
And then I'll start to think about you
If you go
You'll turn my blue skies into grey
For that's the way it seems without you

If you go
There'll be no sun up in the sky as long
as I am left in sorrow
If you go
I've given all that I can give
How will I live until tomorrow
If you go, I want the sweeps,
I'll play the game
But it will never be the same
I'm addicted to you, what will I do if you go

If you go, I'll pull the blinds,
I'll close the door
So that your friends just won't know
I'm broken up, I will die
My race is run, if you go
