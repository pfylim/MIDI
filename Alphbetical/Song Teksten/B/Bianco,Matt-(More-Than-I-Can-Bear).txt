MATT BIANCO - MORE THAN I CAN BEAR

Oohooh oohooh ooh, yeah yea-heah, ooh-ooh

I thought that I was over you
How I was mistaken
Why did I bump into you
And start this chain reaction, ... hmm
I felt it building up inside
When suddenly wohoowo, it was more than I could bear
Hmm, more than I could bear

Oh, when I saw you, walking down the road with someone new
I couldn't, believe that it was true, it was true

I find it hard to sleep at night
This jealousy is burning, ... bright
Visions of somebody else
Torments me to destruction, ... oh, yeah
I think of him, making, making love to you
It's more than I can wohoowo, 
It's more than I can bear, ... hmm more than I can bear

Ah when I saw you, walking down the road with someone new
I couldn't, believe that it was true, it was true
Oh, when I saw you, walking down the road with someone new
I closed my eyes, I know I'm over you, over you

(trombone solo)

Oh, when I saw you, ooh, walking down the road with someone new
I closed my eyes, I know I'm over you, hmm over you

I still love you baby (it's more than I can bear)
I still love you baby
I still love you baby

Oh when I saw you
It's more than I, it's more than I could bear
It's more than I, it's more than I could bear
