Title  : CHANSON D'AMOUR
Artist : BZN

(Words & music: BZN)

It's all you
It's all because you're wonderful
When I was lonely, you where the only 
To ease my mind
You gave me back my faith and then
I found myself in poetry again

You gave me words and I regained my dignity
A voice inside me says I won't lose you anymore
So I wote you this simple song
I used the words you whispered on and on

Chorus:
Chanson d'amour
Je t'aime, j'attendrai
Chantez toujours
When love has come your way

Chorus: ...

I think of you, here on my island in the sun
There was confusion, but my illusion
Did all come true
You gave me back my faith again
I found myself in poetry again

Chorus: ...
