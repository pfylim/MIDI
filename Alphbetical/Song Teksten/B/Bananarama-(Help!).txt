BANANARAMA & LANANEENEENOONOO - HELP

Help, I need somebody, help just not anybody
Help you know I need someone, help

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now those days are gone I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the door

Help me if you can I'm feeling down (down down down)
And I do appreciate you being round (round round round)
Help me get my feet back on the ground (ground ground ground)
Won't you please please help me

(Pete look I think I'm a bit toppy)
(And I'm a bit bottomy Pete)

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

Help me if you can I'm feeling down (help)
And I do appreciate you being round (help)
Help me get my feet back on the ground (help)
Won't you please please help me

(They are gonna take the Bananas off 'ere aren't they)
(Yeah they're just doing backing vocals we're singing the medley)
(Well we better be otherwise there'll be trouble)
(Right)
