Title  : SING A SONG OF LOVE

Sing a song of love
Sing it and the sun will shine for you
Sing a song of love
It's a song that brings your dreams come true
Play it like you feel
It will never let you down my friend
Sing a song of love
Yes it will help you
When it comes right from your heart

Sing a song of love
Written by the music of the sea
Sing a song of love
Sing it and forever you'll be free
Play it like you feel
I can hear music in the air
Sing a song of love
Yes it will help you
When it comes right from your heart

Can you hear the mandolins
The music softly playing in the wind
It is just a simple song
It's made for us
So we can sing along
