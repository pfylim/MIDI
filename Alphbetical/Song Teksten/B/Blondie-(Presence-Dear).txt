Title  : PRESENCE DEAR

(Words & music: Gary Valentine)

Was it destiny? I don't know yet
Was it just by chance
Could this be kismet?
Something in my consciousness
Told my you'd appear
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear

When we play at cards
You use an extra sense
It's really not you
You can read my hand
I've got no defense
When you send your message
Whispered loud and clear
I'm always touched by your presence dear

Floating past the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together with psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophies
Stay awake at night and count your r.e.m.s.
When you've talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence, dear (5x)
