Title  : He's a Liar
Singer : Bee Gees


I stood by the lights as I looked through your window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
You were up in his arms, I was down on my knees
Get the cards on the table
No need to pretend
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love and you know you will pay, but:

Chorus:
He's a liar, he's a liar
And I should know
Liar
He's a liar and I should know

Well, they told me I fell, but I just don't remember
I was standing face down, they were at my feet
There was smoke in the air
And the sweet smell of leather
I was out through the window and down in the street
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry, but I'm still alive
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
He said: "I'll survive", but:

Chorus

Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from the scene of the crime
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine, but:

Chorus


Words & Music : B.M., R. Gibb
