Einleitung:    oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh 

Listen up everybody if you wanna take a chance
just get on the floor and go the new kids dance
don't worry about nothing cause it won't take long
we gonna put you in a trance with a funky song

Refrain

Hangin'tough, hangin'tough, hangin'tough
are you tough enough
hangin'tough, hangin'tough, 

everybody's always talking about who's on top
don't cross your path cause you're gonna get stopped
we ain't gonna give anybody any slack
and if you try to keeps us down
we're gonna come right back and you know we're
