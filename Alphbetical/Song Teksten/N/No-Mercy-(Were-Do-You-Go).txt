WHERE DO YOU GO? - NO MERCY


Refrain
Where do you go my lovely?
Where do you go?
I want to know my lovely.
I want to know
Where do you go?
Oh woe eh oh
I wanna know.
Oh woe eh oh
Where do you go?
Oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh oh
I wanna know.
Where do you where do you go?
Where do you where do you go?
You leave without a word 
No message no number.
And now my head is pounding
Like rolling thunder.
You left me with a 
Heartache deep inside.
You should see me cry 
All night as I wonder.
Everybody says what a shame 
What is wrong?
They don`t like the game you play.
Heard your hanging round 
Every night until dawn.
I`ve been waiting for you 
Night and day.
Refrain
You got to break the silence first
Don`t keep me waiting.
Just like a river flow into the sea
Your running back to me 
To hear what I`m saying.
Where do you go my lovely?
I wanna know.
Where do you go?
Oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh oh
Where do you go?
Oh oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh 
Oh oh oh oho eh oh
I wanna know.
Where do you where do you go?
Save me.
Come back and dry the tears 
I cry for you baby.
You gotta stop this
Heartache deep inside.
You gotta help me 
Make it through the night.
Save me.
Come back and save me.
Where do you go my lovely?
Where do you go ?
I wanna know my lovely.
I wanna know.
Where do you go my lovely?
Where do you go?
I wanna know.
Where do you where do you go?
