Singer : NAZARETH 
Title  : LOVE HURTS

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and marks
Any heart not tough nor strong enough
It takes a lot of pain
Takes a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
It bears a lot of rain
Love hurts, oohoo, love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
Burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, oohoo, love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not fooling me
Love is just a lie
Mad to make you blue
Love hurts, oohoo, love hurts
