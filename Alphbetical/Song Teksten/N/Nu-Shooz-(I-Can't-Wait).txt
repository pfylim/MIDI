NU SHOOZ - I CAN'T WAIT

Baby I can't wait

My love tell me what it's all about
You got something that I can't live without
Happiness is so hard to find hey baby
Tell me what is on your mind

'Cause I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
Till you call me on the phone
'Cause I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
Till we're all alone (I can't wait)

You know I love you even when you don't try
I know that our love will never die
Hey darling when you look into my eye
Please tell me you'll never have to say goodbye

'Cause I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
This is what I've been waiting for
I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
Till my love walks in the door
I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
True love is so hard to find
I found yours you found mine
I can't wait (baby I can't wait)
Tell me what is on your mind
(I can't wait, I can't wait)
No I can't I'll tell you one more time
(baby I can't wait)
Tell me what is on your mind
(baby I can't wait)
This is what I've been waiting for
Ooh ooh I can't wait
Till my love walks in the door
