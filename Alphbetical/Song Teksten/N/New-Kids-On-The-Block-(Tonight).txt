Title  : Tonight
Singer : New Kids On The Block


Remember when we said
Girl, please don't go
And how I'd be loving you forever
Taught you 'bout hanging tough
As long as you got the right stuff
Didn't we girls
Didn't we girls

Well I guess it's a brandnew day after all
Everytime we hear the curtain call
See the girls with curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins
And the loud fanfares
Tonight, tonight
Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls
Fanmail from everywhere showed us how you care
Didn't it girls
Didn't it girls

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

Sound good
Hey fellas, let's do it
Here we go
La la la la la tonight
