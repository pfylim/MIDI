Oh Lord
what is this ?
I'm full of it tonight
right !

Well I've had my share of bad times
I've been shooting 'em up
drinking 'em down
taking thme pills
fooling around
all my life
but I'm so tired of bad times
I'll have to change my way.

And I've had my share of ggod times
I've been moving around
living uptown
laughin' my ass off almost
every night
but I'm so sore from laughing
I haven't got the will to fight.

All my life I have ben waiting
to find a reason
to give it up for and
do a lot more
every day of my life.

I'm going to wake up every morning
come home every evening
just jump into bed
and lie there
and laugh with my wife.

Well I've had my share of bad times
I've been shooting 'em up
drinking 'em down
taking thme pills
fooling around
all my life
but I'm so tired of bad times
I'll have to change my way.

And I've had my share of ggod times
I've been moving around
living uptown
laughin' my ass off almost
almost every night
but I'm so sore from laughing
I haven't got the will to fight.
