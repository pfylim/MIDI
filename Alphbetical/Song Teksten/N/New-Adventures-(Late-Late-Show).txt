Singer : NEW ADVENTURES
Title  : LATE LATE SHOW

(Words & music: Peter Bootsman)

I was watching a movie
In the late late show
Hollywood pictures they move me
Sound around in stereo

Movin' me up, turnin' me on
Movin' me up, turnin' me on

Watchin' the picture in the late late show
Some place to be when you got nowhere to go

I was a hero
I was a bad mean guy
I was an easy heartbreaker
I was a rough troublemaker

I took the girl next to me
And we laid down in ecstacy
Then I killed her with my knife
Diana Keaton lost her life
