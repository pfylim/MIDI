Title  : Yellow Moon
Singer : Neville Brothers


Yellow moon, yellow moon
Why you keep peeping in my window
Do you know something I don't know
Did you see my baby
Walking down the railroad tracks
You can tell me if the girl's
Ever coming back
Is she hid out with another
Or is she trying to get back home
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms
Or is the girl somewhere all alone
Can you see if she is missing me
Or is she having a real good time
Has she forgotten all about
Or is the girl still mine all mine

Chorus (2x):
With your eye so big a shinney
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon can you tell me
If the girl's with another man
Oh, yellow moon
Have you seen that creole woman
You can tell me
Now ain't you a friend of mine
