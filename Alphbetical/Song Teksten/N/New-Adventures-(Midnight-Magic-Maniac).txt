Title  : MIDNIGHT MAGIC MANIAC
Artist : NEW ADVENTURES

(Words & music: New Adventures)

Full moon risin' it's a moonlit night
Baby's asleep, she's doin' it right
Wild cats moanin' starrtin' a fight
While shadows play in the dark night light

Echoes of silence, they last for years
They come and they go, but they never disappear
I give a scream, but nobody hears
Too many black holes in the atmosphere

When the clock beats twelve, I'm on my way
Just woke up and slept all day
Gotta lust for love and I love to play
All I need is a willing prey

I believe in midnight magic, babe
(here we come) I'm a midnight magic maniac

When black night fades in shades of grey
Early birds bring brand new day
Midnight magic fades away
All that's left is the price to pay
