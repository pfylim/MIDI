           Travelin Man          Rickie Nelson


I'm a travelin man made a lot of stops all over the
world and in every town I own my heart well at least
one lonely girl
I've a pretty senorita waiting for me down in old
Mexico and if you're ever in a last well stop and
see my cued little Eskimo

Refrain

Oh my sweet Fraulein down in Berlin town makes
my heart start to yearn nd my china doll down in
old Hong Kong waits for my return
pretty polonesian baby over the see I remember the
night when we walked in the sands of the Wai Kiki
and I held you oh so tight


Refrain

Oh my sweet Fraulein ...
