If I get on up and dance for you
Scream and shout like a witch voo-doo
Would you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
A-ha, if I dress on up in fancy clothes
With a come-on smile and real nice pose
Would you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
Yeah, baby baby

Mm, well, I'm tired of getting through to you
It ain't no good, 'cos I just can't do enough
Can't do enough
Mm, well, I'm always here when you want to play
But then you walk away when I need you love
I need your love
I don't wanna be a star attraction
Just need some action
So come on baby, can't you see?
All I'm asking is for a little attention to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If I walk right up with another guy
Come on now, boy, won't you turn your eye
Would you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
O ho, yeah, are you list'ning baby

Attention to me, pay attention to me
Attention to me, pay attention to me
I don't wanna be a, yeah yeah yeah

If I get on up and dance for you
Scream and shout like a witch voo-doo
Would you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
A-ha, if I dress on up in fancy clothes
With a come-on smile and real nice pose
Would you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
Yeah, baby baby

So won't you give a little bit
A-ha, give a little bit of attention to me?
