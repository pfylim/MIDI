4. THIS FLIGHT TONIGHT - NAZARETH

Intro: 4 Takte Rhythmus + Feedback-Guitar

Vers 1:
"Look out the left", the captain said,
"The lights down there, that's where we'll land!"
I saw a falling  star burning  high above the  Las Vegas sand.
It wasn't the one  that you gave to me
That night down South between the trailer.
Not the early one, that you wish upon,
Not the Northern one   that guides  in the sailors.

Vers 2:
You've got the touch  so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Can't talk to you babe, you know I get so weak
Sometimes I think that   love is just mythical.
Up there's a heaven, down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little light shine
Blackness, blackness, dragging me down
Come on light the candle  in this heart of mine!

Refrain:
Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like
Turn this crazy bird around,
Shouldn't I have got on   this flight tonight!

Guitarsolo (Feedback-Guitar):

Vers 3:
I'm drinking sweet champagne,  got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out, can't drum you out of my mind
They're singing: "Goodbye baby, baby bye-bye, ooh-ooh, love is blind!"
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better  when we meet again, babe!

Refrain:
Starbright, starbright, you've got the lovin' that I like
Turn this crazy bird around,
Shouldn't I have got on  this flight tonight
Shouldn't I have got on this  flight tonight
