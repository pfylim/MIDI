TYKA NELSON - MARC ANTONY'S TUNE

(Words & music: Tyka Nelson)

I always thought I would be lonely yeah
I never thought you'd appear not in my life and not here
But as I look out into the sunset I feel inside you are near
You're really here in my life

Nobody wants to be alone
And nobody wants to cry
Well, nobody wants to feel the tears in their eyes
The tears in their eyes

Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Baby save a little love save a little love
Save a little love for me in your heart
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me

Listen I've always dreamed of catching rainbows in the sky
Ain't gonna give my life up until the day that I've tried oh no
Can't you see me standing on the morning when it comes
I'll be there laughing when the worlds above unite and are one

Nobody wants to be alone
And nobody wants to cry
Well, nobody wants to feel the tears in their eyes
The tears in their eyes

Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Baby save a little love save a little love
Save a little love for me in your heart
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me

I could never love you any more than I do
You make me feel alive and I'm spreading the news
Everybody's gonna know when we are through
That you're made up for me and I am made up for you
(Marc Anthony play)

Solo

Why can't you see
You're all that I need
You're the other part of me
Yeah

Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Baby save a little love save a little love
Save a little love for me in your heart
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
Marc Anthony oh baby save a little love for me
