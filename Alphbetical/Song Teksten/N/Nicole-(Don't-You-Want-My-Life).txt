NICOLE - DON'T YOU WANT MY LOVE

You, you make me hot
You make my body feel delirious
Please, don't ever stop
Listen 'cause I'm being serious
'Cause you and I were made for each other
A habit that's too hard to break

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
Until we get started
Then you'll want my love

Hot is how I feel
When you bring your body close to mine
Heat it feels so real
'Cause sweat runs down my body every time
'Cause you and I just one night together
It's a memory you'll never erase

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
Until we get started
Then you'll want my love

'Cause you and I were made for each other
It's a habit that's too hard to break

Don't you want my love
Don't you need my body
Don't you want my love
Won't you take my heart
Until we get started
Then you'll want my love
