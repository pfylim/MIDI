       On the road again           Willie Nelson 


On the road again - just can't wait to get on the road again.
The life I love is making music with my friends ,
And I can't wait to get on the road again .

On the road again - goin' places that I've never been .
Seein' things that I may never see again ,
And I can't wait to get on the road again .

On the road again - like a band of gypsies we go down the highway , 
we're the best of friends .
Insisting that the world keep turning our way ,
And our way , is on the road again .
Just can't wait to get on the road again .
The life I love is makin' music with my friends ,
And I can't wait to get on the road again .
