     VSP


     May be I hang around here, a little more than I should

     We both now I got somewhere else to go

     But I got something to tell you, that I never thought I would

     but I believe you really ought to know


     I love you , I honestly love you


     You don't have to answer, i see it in your eyes

     Maybe it was better left unsaid

     But this is pure and simple, and you must realize

     That it's coming from my heart and not my head

     
     I love you, I honestly love you

     
     I'm not trying to make you feel uncomf'table

     I'm not tryin' to make you anything at all

     But this feeling doesn't come along every day

     and you shouldn't blow the chance when you got the chance  to say

     I love you  (gesproken : I love you) I honestly love you 

     (modul.)

     If we were born in another place and time 

     This moment might be ending with a kiss

     But there you are with yours, and here I am with  mine

     So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

     
     I love you , I honestly love you  ,I honestly love you
