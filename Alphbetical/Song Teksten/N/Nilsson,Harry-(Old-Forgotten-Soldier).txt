Reaching for a butterfly
old soldiers never die
and the gun against their shoulder
well it gets a little older
and just like that old shoulder
it just gets put away.

Well I'm an old forgotten soldier
since they put an end to war
and I'd like to tell my story
but you don't wanna hear
'bout the war.

I'm an old forgotten campaign hero
left without a cause
because, they took away my wars.

I'm an old forgotten railroad
a broken, lonely, empty ammo-train
and my rusty ammunition
has been left out in the rain.

I'm an old forgotten part-time doughboy
I tried to save the world
the world was round
we fired a round
heard all around the world.

I'm an old forgotten campaign hero
left without a cause
because, they took away my wars.

I'm an old forgotten railroad
a deserted ammo-train
and my rusty ammunition
has been left out in the rain.
