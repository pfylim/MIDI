CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT - NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK


I can tell
You've been watching me
Girl I've been watching
You too
I got the feeling
You want my love
I must admit
I want your love too

RefrainCall it what you want baby
 Girl I call it love
 Call it what you want darling
 I'll still call it love

You know there is something
About you, girl
What it is, is kinda hard
To say
I only wish
We could get away
Give me love
And I'll lead the way

Refrain

Na na na 
Na na na 

It's so groovy
Just to be with you
It's so good babe
Just to dance or anything
That you want to do

I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel that love girl

Refrain

You can call it this
You can call it that
You can call it anything baby
