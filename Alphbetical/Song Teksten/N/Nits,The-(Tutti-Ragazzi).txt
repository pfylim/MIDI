Singer : THE NITS
Title  : TUTTI RAGAZZI

(Words & music: Henk Hofstede)

On the backseat of a motorscooter
It's so crazy what I'm doing to her
Eighty miles on the rocks is asking for a crash

Tutti ragazzi with Italian shoes
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
Together we know what to do
As long as you keep on dancing
Keep on dancing

Was it love at first sight
When I saw her that night?
Be my lover tonight
With the A.M. beside
No, no bambini for me
Tutti tamari for you
Pizza Marguerrita, signorina, it's true

Tutti ragazzi with Italian shoes
It doesn't matter if you win or lose
Together we know what to do
As long as you keep on dancing
Keep on dancing

Was it love at first sight
When I saw her that night?
Be my lover tonight
With the A.M. beside
No, no bambini for me
Tutti tamari for you
Pizza Marguerrita, signorina, it's true
