Title  : WORLD OF WATER
Artist : NEW MUSIC

(Words & music: Tony Mansfield)

These waters have frozen
Can't break the ice no more
It's raining so hard now
Can't seem to find a shore

Chorus:
World of water
Where you swim for the other side
World of water
But you're swimming against the tide

This all goes so much deeper
Than some would like to say
Soaked in this world of water
Until it's washed away

Chorus: ...

World of water
You can drown, but you still survive
No colour, no feeling
No time to sit around
No one here to be found,no entry, no exit

l like to be beside the sea
The tide comes in once more
The water here still rising
lt's come to drag me down

Chorus: ...2x...
