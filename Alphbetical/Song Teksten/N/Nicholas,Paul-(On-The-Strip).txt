Title  : ON THE STRIP 
 
(Words & music: Bugatti/Musker) 
 
See ya, see ya, see ya 
On the strip, yeah 
Eddie's getting ready 
He's reeving up the chevy 
His mamma has said his jeans are too tight 
We got together 
Whether the girls are into leather 
And we're feeling pretty good tonight 
Now listen honey, I've got some money 
And I know a place that's really hip 
Put on some radio music 
We're going to the strip 
 
Chorus: 
On the strip, it's a beautiful night 
On the strip, people feeling alright 
On the strip, we're gonna take you for a ride 
On the strip, it's such a trip 
On the strip 
 
See ya, see ya, see ya 
On the strip, yeah 
Red lights, green lights, head lights 
Seems like everybody got a seven wheels 
And we've got sunshine in the nighttime 
That's how it feels 
Got to get away 
On a Saturday 
Feels so right on the strip 
 
Chorus: ... 
 
See ya, see ya, see ya 
On the strip 
Got to get away on a Saturday 
Feels so rich on the strip 
It's a beautiful night
