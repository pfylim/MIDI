Singer : NITS 
Title  : YES OR NO

(Words & music: Henk Hofstede)

Yes or no
Listen to me lady, 'cause I do wanna know
Whether it's yes or no
You made a decision, is it yes or no, yes or no

I get up in the morning feeling so good
Aha, when I look at you, what can I do
You tell me yes or no
It will make no difference, don't wanna go
Whether it's yes or no
You're keeping me waiting, is it yes or no
Yes or no
You're alone in the evening, you're feeling so bad
Aha, when you look at me, what do you see

Taxi, taxi, taxi
Won't you bring back my little Cindy
I've been looking for a lady like her all my life
I've been looking for a lady like her all my life

Yes or no
Please don't make me guess, really wanna know
Whether it's yes or no
You made a decision, is it yes or no yes or no

Taxi, taxi, taxi
Won't you bring back my little Cindy
I've been looking for a lady like her all my life
I've been looking for a lady like her all my life
I've been looking for a lady like her all my life

Yes or no, will it be too fast, will it be too slow
You tell me yes or no, will it be a stay
Do I have to go
You tell me yes or no, is it half past seven, is it Dr. No
You tell me yes or no, is it funky music or is it modern jazz
No or yes, is it Paul McCartney or Graham Nash
You tell me yes, maybe
