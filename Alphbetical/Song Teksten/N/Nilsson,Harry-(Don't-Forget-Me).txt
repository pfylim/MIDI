In the wintertime
keep your feet warm
but keep your clothes on
and don't forget me
keep the memories
but keep your powder dry to.

In the summertime
by the poolside
while the fireflies
are all around you
I'll miss you when I'm lonely
I'll miss the alimony too.

Don't forget me, don't forget me
make it easy on me
just for a little while
you know I'll think about you
let me know you think about me too.

When we're older
and full of cancer
it doesn't matter now
come on get happy
'cause nothing lasts forever
but I will always love you.
