STUMBLIN' IN - SUZI QUATRO & CHRIS NORMAN


Refrain (in Duett):
Our love is alive  and so we begin, 
foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in. 
Our love is a flame  burning within, 
Now and then fire-light will catch us, stumblin' in. 

Vers 1:
He:       Wherever you go,  whatever you do, 
          you know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
She:      I've fallen for you  whatever you do, 
          'cause baby you've shown me so many things that I ever knew
Together: Whatever it takes  baby, I'll do it for you!  (Break)
