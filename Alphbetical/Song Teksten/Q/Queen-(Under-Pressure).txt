Pressure pushing down on me
pressing down on you no man ask for
under pressure - that burns a building down
splits a family in two
puts people on streets
it's the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends
screaming let me out
pray tomorrow - gets me higher
pressure on people - people on streets
chippin' around - kick my brains around the floor
these are the days it never rains but it pours
people on streets - people on streets
it's the terror of knowing
what this world is about
watching some good friends
screaming let me out
pray tomorrow - gets me higher
pressure on people - people on streets
turned away from it all like a blind man
sat on a fence but it don't work
keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
why - why - why
love
insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
can't we give ourselves one more chance
why can't we give love that one more chance
why can't we give love
cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
the people on the edge  of the night
and love dares you to change our way of
caring about ourselves
this is your last dance
this is your last dance
this is ourselves
under pressure
under pressure
pressure.
