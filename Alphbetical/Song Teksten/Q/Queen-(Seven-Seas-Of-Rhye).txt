Interpret:    QUEEN

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Fear me, you lords and lady preachers,
I descend upon your earth from the skies;
I command your very souls,
you unbelievers,
bring before me what is mine,
the seven seas of Rhye.

Can you hear me, you peers and privy councillors,
I stand before you naked to the eyes;
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust,
I swear that you'll be mine,
at the seven seas of Rhye.

Sister, I live and lie for you, Mister,
do and I'll die; you are mine,
I possess you, belong to you forever.

Storm the master marathon,
I'll fly through by flash and thunder fire
and I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive,
then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive.
Begone with you, you shod and shady
senators.
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries;
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours,
and with a smile, i'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye.
