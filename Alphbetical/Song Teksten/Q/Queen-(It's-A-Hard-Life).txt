I don't want my freedom
there's no reason for living with a broken heart.

This is a tricky situation -
I've only got myself to blame
it's just a simple fact of live
it can happen to anyone -

You win - you lose
it's a chance you have to take with love
oh yeah - I fell in love
but now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.

It's a hard life
to be true lovers together
to love and live forever in each others hearts -
it's a long hard fight
to learn to care for each other
to trust in one another right from the start
when you're in love -

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
they say it's just a state of mind
but it happens to everyone -

How it hurts - deep inside
when your love has cut you down to size
life is tough - on your own
now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
waiting for love.

Yes it's a hard life
two lovers together
to love and live forever in each others hearts -
it's a long hard fight
to learn to care for each other
to trust in one another right from the start
when you're in love -
yes it's a hard life
in a world that's filled with sorrow
there are people searching for love in every way -

It's a long hard fight -
but I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love.
