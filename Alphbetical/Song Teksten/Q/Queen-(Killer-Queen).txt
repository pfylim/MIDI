Titel:        KILLER QUEEN

Interpret:    QUEEN

---------------------------------------------------------------------

She keeps Moet and Chandon
in her pretty cabinet, "let them eat cake,"
she says, just like Marie Antoinette.
A built in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy,
and any time an invitation you can decline.
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette, 
extr'ordinarily nice.

She's a Killer Queen, gun powder, gelatine,
dynamite with a laser beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime, ooh.
Recomended at the price, 
in satiable an apetite, wanna try.

To avoid complications, she never kept the same address,
in conversation she spoke just like a baroness.
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah, Then again in
cidentally if you're that way in clined.
Perfume came nat'rally from Paris, 
for cars she couldn't careless,
fastidious and precise.

She's a Killer Queen, gun powder, gelatine,
dynamite with a laser beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime, ooh.
Recomended at the price, 
in satiable an apetite, wanna try.

Drop of a hat she's as willing as playful as a pussycat, 
then momentarily out of action,
temporarily out of gas;
To absolutely drive you wild, wild.

She's a Killer Queen, gun powder, gelatine,
dynamite with a laser beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime, ooh.
Recomended at the price, 
in satiable an apetite, what a drag.
