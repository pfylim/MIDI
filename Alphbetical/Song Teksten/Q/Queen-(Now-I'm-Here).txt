Here I stand, here I stand,
look around, around, around, around,
around, around, around, around,
                        (but you won't see me) 
                        (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here, now I'm here,
(now I'm here, now I'm here)
now I'm there, now I'm there, now I'm there
(now I'm there)
I'm just a -

just a new man, yes you made me live again.
A baby I was when you took my hand
and the light of the night burned bright;
And the people all stared, didn't understand,
but you knew my name on sight.
Whatever came of you and me,
America's new bride to be.
Don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound,
down in the dungeon, just Peaches and me.

Don't I love her so, yes,
she made me live again.
yeah, a thin-moon me in a smoke-screen sky
where the beams of your love light chase;
Don't move don't speak, don't feel no pain,
with the rain running down my face.
Your matches still light up the sky
and many a tear lives on in my eye.
Down in the city, just Hoople and me,
Don't I love him so, don't I love him so.

Whatever comes of you and me,
I love to leave my memory with you.
Now I'm here, now I'm here,
think I'll stay around, around, around, around, around, around,
down in the city, just you and me.
Don't I love you so.
Go, go, go, little queenie.
