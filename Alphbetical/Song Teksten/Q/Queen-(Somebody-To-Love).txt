Singer : QUEEN 
Title  : SOMEBODY TO LOVE

(Words & music: Freddie Mercury)

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Each morning I get up I die a little
Can't barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me?
I have spent all my years in believing in you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones at the end
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees and I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Every day I try and try and try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Anybody find me
Somebody to
Got no feel
I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm O.K. I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love (10x)

Somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody, somebody
Find me somebody , find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me, find me
