I can dim the lights and sing you songs 
full of sad things, 
we can do the tango just for two.
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings,
be your Valentino just for you.
Ooh love, ooh lover boy,
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy ?
Set my alarm, turn on my charm,
that's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy.
Ooh, let me feel your heartbeat,
ooh, can you feel my love heat,
come on and sit on my hot seat of love,
and tell me how do you feel right after all.
I'd like for you and I to go romancing,
say the word, your wish is my command.
Ooh love, ooh lover boy,
what're you doin' tonight, hey boy,
write my letter, feel much better,
I'll use my fancy patter on the telephone.
When I'm not with you,
Think of you always, I miss you.
When I'm not with you, think of me always,
I love you, love you.
Hey boy, where did you get it from ?
Hey boy, where did you go ?
I learned my passion 
in the good old fashioned school of lover boy.

Dining at the Ritz, we'll meet at nine precisely,
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine.
Driving back in style in my saloon will do quite nicely,
just take me back to yours, that will be fine.
Ooh love, ooh lover boy,
what're you doin' tonight, hey boy ?
Ev'rything's alright, just hold on tight,
that's because I'm a good old fashioned lover boy.
'Cause I'm a good old fashioned lover boy.
