I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
go crazy, driving in the fast lane
my baby left me alone
she done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
so come home, come home
if you don't you're gonna break my heart.

Man on the prowl
you better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
so look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.

I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
all I wanna do is sit on my ass
so honey come home
don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
come home - come home
if you don't you're gonna break my heart.

Man on the prowl
you better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
so look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.

Well I keep dreaming about my baby
but it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I wanna teach my baby dancin'
but I ain't no Fred Astair.

So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
look out - man on the prowl - yeah
baby, baby, baby look out - man on the prowl.

Baby come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
baby come home - oh yeah
cause I'm a man on the prowl
so honey come home - come home
cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah
man on the prowl.
