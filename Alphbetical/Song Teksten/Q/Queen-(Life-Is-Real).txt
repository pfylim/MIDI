Guilt stains on my pillow
blood on my terraces
torsos in my closet
shadows from my past life is real
life is real, life is real, so real
sleeping in my leisure
waking up in a minefield
dream is just a pleasure dome
love is a roulette wheel - life is real
life is real, life is real, oh yeah
success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
loneliness is my hiding place
breasfeeding myself
what more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
life is real, life is real, life is real
music will be my mistress
loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
living in every pore
life is real, life is real, life is real, so real
life is cruel
life is a bitch
life is real - so real.
