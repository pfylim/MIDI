I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
you're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free.

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
and this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
god knows, God knows I've fallen in love.

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
but I have to be sure
when I walk out that door
oh how I want to be free, baby
oh how I want to be free, 
oh how I want to break free.

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
so baby can't you see
I've got to break free.

I've got to break free.
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.
