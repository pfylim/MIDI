Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh,
I'm in pretty good shape,
the best years of my life are like a super nova,
huh, huh, perpetula craze, I said that
everybody drank my wine - you get my drift,
and then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well,
we really had a good good time they was all so sexy.
We was bad, we was blitzed,
all in all it was a pretty good trip,
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head,
wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey,
he pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me,
I said uh, uh, babe,
now listen no one stops my party,
no one stops my party,
no one, no one, no one stops my party,
just like I said,
we were phased, we was pissed,
just having a total eclipse,
this one's on me so let us do it just right,
this here one party don't get started 'till midnight,
party to the left,
party to the right,
left - right
no one stops my ...
't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
but I'll never get caught
