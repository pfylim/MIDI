Back Chat Back Chat
you burn all my energy
Back Chat Back Chat
criricising all you see
Back Chat Back Chat
analysing what I say
Back Chat Back Chat
and you always get your way
oh yeah see what you've done to me
Back Chat Back Chat
you're driving me insane
it's a battle to the end, knock you down you come again.

Talk back, talk back you've got me on the rack
twisting every word I say
wind me up and get your way
fat chance I have of making a romance
if I'm ever going to win
I'll have to get the last word in
take it from there
twisting every word i say
wind me up and get your way
Back Chat Back Chat
criricising all you see
Back Chat Back Chat
analysing what I say
Back Chat Back Chat
and you always get your way.

Wake up stand up and drag yourself on out
get down get ready
scream and shout
back off, be cool
and learn to change your ways
cos you're talking in your sleep
and you're walking in a daze
don't push your luck
I'm ready to attack
cos when I'm trying to talk to you
all you do is just talk back
you stand so tall, you don't frighten me at all
don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
just leave me alone.

Back Chat Back Chat
you burn all my energy
Back Chat Back Chat
criricising all you see
Back Chat Back Chat
analysing what I say
Back Chat Back Chat
and you always get your way
yes you do...
