It started off so well,
they said we made a perfect pair.
I clothed myself in your glory and your love, 
how I loved you, how I cried.
The years of care and loyality 
were nothing but a sham, it seems
the years belie we lived a lie 
I'll love you 'til I die.

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home.

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
to start again with some body new,
was it all wasted, all that love ?
I hang my head and I advertise
a soul for sale or rent 
I have no heart I'm cold inside, 
I have no real intent.

Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home.

** Instrumental **

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you 'til I die.
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
save me, save me, save me
Don't let me face my life alone.
Save me , save me, oh.
I'm naked and I'm far from home.
