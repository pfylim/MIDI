Titel:             HAMMER TO FALL

Interpret/Text:    QUEEN

Here we stand or here we fall
history won't care at all
make the bed, light the light
lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

You don't waste no time at all
don't hear the bell but you answer the call
it comes to you as to us all
we're just waiting
for the hammer to fall.

Oh every night, and every day
a little piece of you is falling away
but lift your face, the Western Way -
build your muscles as your body decays.

Toe your line and play their game
let the anaesthetic cover it all
till one day they call your name
you know it's time for the hammer to fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
your truth it's all the same
lock your door but rain is pouring
through your window pane
baby now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
in the shadow of the mushroom cloud
convinced our voices can't be heard
we just wanna scream it louder and louder.

What the hell we fighting for ?
just surrender and it won't hurt at all
you just got time to say your prayers
while you're waiting for the hammer to fall.
