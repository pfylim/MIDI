Title  : CRAZY LITTLE THING CALLED LOVE

(Words & music: Freddie Mercury)

Chorus:
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love

This thing, this thing, called love, called love
It cries, cries baby, in the cradle all night
It swings, ooh, it jives, ooh
Shakes all over like a jellyfish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to rock and roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me high, high fever
She leaves me in a cold, cold sweat

I gotta be cool, relax
Get hip and get on my tracks
Take a back seat, ooh hitch-hike, ooh
Take a long ride on my motorbike
Till I'm ready, ready Freddy
To raise a little thing called love

Chorus: ...

Crazy little thing called love (...10x...)
