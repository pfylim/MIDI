QUEEN - BREAKTHRU'

(Words & music: Queen)

When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru' now
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

I wake up
Feel just fine
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cause you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something you're touchin' me
I'm under your thumb under your spell can't you see
If only I could reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru' oh yeah

(Breakthru') these barriers of pain
(Breakthru') yeah to the sunshine from the rain
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru' now oh yeah

Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one of your looks at me
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me
Honey you're sparking something this fire in me
I'm outta control I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy

If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru'
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru' oh yeah
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru'
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
It would really be a breakthru'
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
