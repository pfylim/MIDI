Interpret/Text:    QUEEN

---------------------------------------------------------------------


So sad her eyes
smiling dark eyes
so sad her eyes
as it began.

On such a breathless night as this
upon my brow the lightest kiss
I walked alone
and all around the air did say
my lady soon will stir this way
in sorrow known
the white Queen walks and the night grows pale
stars of lovingness in her hair.

Needing - unheard
pleading- one word
so sad my eyes
she cannot see.

How did thee fare, what have thee seen
the mother of the willow green
I call her name
and 'neath her windoe have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
and when she came
white Queen how my heart did ache
and dry my lips no word would make
so still I wait.

My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
it's for evermore that I wait.

Dear friend goodbye
no tears in my eyes
so sad it ends
as it began.
