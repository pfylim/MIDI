Calling all boys
calling all girls
calling all people on streets
around the world
take this message
a message for you
this message is old yeah
this message is true
this message is
love
take a message of love
far and near
take a message of love
for all to hear 
for all to hear
some sleepless nights in wait for you
some foreign presence you feel, comes
creeping through
some stream of hope
the whole world through
spread like some silent disease
you'll get yours too
this message is
love
take a message of love
far and near
take a message of love
for all to hear 
for all to hear
calling all boys
calling all girls.
