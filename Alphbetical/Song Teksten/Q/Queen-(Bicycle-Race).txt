Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle,
I want to ride my bicycle,
bicycle, bicycle.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride my bike.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride it where I like.
You say black, I say white,
you say bark, I say bite.
You say shark, I say hey, man ,
Jaws was never my scene and I don't like Star Wars.
You say Rolls, I say Royce,
you say car, give me a choice.
You say Lord, I say Christ, 
I don't believe in Peter Pan,
Frankenstein or Superman.
All I wanna do is
bicycle, bicycle, bicycle,
I want to ride my bicycle,
bicycle, bicycle.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride my bike.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride my bicycle 
races are coming your way,
so forget all your duties, oh, yeh.
Fat bottomed girls, they'll be riding today,
so look out for those beauties, oh yeh.
On your marks, get set , go.
Bicycle race, bicycle race, bicycle race
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle,
I want to ride my bicycle,
bicycle, bicycle,
bicycle, bicycle, bicycle race.

You say coke, I say chain, 
you say John, I say Wayne.
Hot dog I say "cool it, man"
I don't wanna be the president of America.
You say smile, I say cheese,
Cartier, I say please.
Income tax, I say Jesus,
I don't wanna be a candidate for
Vietnam or Watergate !
Cause all I wanna do is
bicycle, bicycle, bicycle,
I want to ride my bicycle,
bicycle, bicycle.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride my bike.
I want to ride my bicycle,
I want to ride it where I like.
