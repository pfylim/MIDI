Title  : FLY TOO HIGH

(Words & music: Janis Ian/Georgio Moroder)

Anonymous autonomous
Will likely get the best of us yet
Before you disappear
If you can lend me half an ear
I'll regret

If I treat you like a number
It's because I can't remember your name
So have another cigarette
And help me to forget why I came

Run too fast, fly too high
Run too fast, fly too high

On dark and lonely nights
I'm only right
When things are bright on the floor
Dancing and romancing
Gallivanting with a handsome I score

And if you don't believe me
You should see me when I'm ready to roar

'Cause I'll lose my concentration
With a new infatuation, I'm sure

You run too fast, fly too high
You run too fast, fly too high
You got no past, no goodbye
You run too fast, fly too high

Would you believe
I was once gonna be somebody
Packed up my bags
And I took what I had to the city

Man it was rough to find the best I could be
Waiting for the limit on a color t.v.
Now I've made it this far
Got a room on the park and a view
And you fly too high

Run too fast, fly too high
Run too fast, fly too high
