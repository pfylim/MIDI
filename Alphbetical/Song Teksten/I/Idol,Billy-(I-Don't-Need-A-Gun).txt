A human heart goes out tonight
Yes a red hot love on red stop light
I see a scene so cold
It echos in blue
Oh those twisting tangues
They are after you
Wop bop a lu bop
Son you gotta move up
flip flop fly
Lawdy miss clowdy
Oh what a story
Dreams to buy
on't need a knife
To violate my life
It's all so insane
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: When the other man has none
         You don't need a gun
         Yes a russian roulette no fun
         I don't need a gun
         I just need someone
         I don't need a gun
         You will always be crying
         Yeah yeah
         Oh you will always be dying
         Oh you will always be dying
         Oh yeah to be someone
         I don't need a gun
         I don't need a gun
         I don't need a gun
         You will always be crying
         Cry cry cry cry
         Cry cry cry cry

Elvis a fight the dying light
Blood red lights
A domination street
Just need your love
And I feel that heat
You can drive me
Through that red stop light
With whiplash smile
Wop bop a lu bop
Son you gotta move up
Flip flop fly
Lawdy miss clawdy
Oh what a story
Gold to buy
Don't need a knife to violate my life
It's all insane

Johnny Ray he's always crying
Gene Vincent cried
Who slapped John
Yes and me
I'm moving moving moving moving
