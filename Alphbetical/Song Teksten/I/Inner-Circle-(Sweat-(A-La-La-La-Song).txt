
12. Sweat (a la la long) - INNER CIRCLE

I've been watchin' you, alalalalalong......

Standing across the room I saw you smile
Said I wanna talk to you for a little while
But before I make my move my emotion start runnin' wild
But don't get tired and that's no lie lookin' in your eyes,
Lookin' in your big brown eyes
I got this to say to you

Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it some more
Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it, push it push it some more... alalalalalong......

So I say to myself
If she loves me or not
But the dread I know, that love is wish to have
And a little bit to this and a little bit to that
The loose goes only attacked
But don't get tired 'cos there's no lie lookin' in your eyes
Lookin' in your big brown eyes
I got this to say to you

Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it some more
Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it, push it push it some more... alalalalalong......

Eyes, I'm Lookin' in your big brown eyes
Eyes, I'm Lookin' in your big brown eyes

Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it some more
Girl I wanna make you sweat,
Sweat till you can sweat no more
And if you cry out, I gonna push it, push it push it some more... alalalalalong......
