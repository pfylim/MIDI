Title  : Lie To Me
Singer : Chris Isaak


There is a woman, far over the sea
Standing and waiting
Praying for me
Here I lie sleeping, a girl by my side
who am I hurting, each time I lie?

Chorus:
Lie to me, lie (2x)

There is a woman
Trying hard to be grave
The way that I hurt her
Has made her afraid
The things that I'm doing
Are breaking her heart
Still, she's pretending
That we'll never part

Chorus

I don't care what people may say
I know everybody lies
I'm not trying to hurt my lover
I'm only trying to get by

Repeat first stanza

Chorus
