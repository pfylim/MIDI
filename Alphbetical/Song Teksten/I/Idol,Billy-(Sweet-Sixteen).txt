 Artist: Billy Idol


 I'll do anything for my sweet sixteen,
 And I'll do anything for little runaway child
 Gave my heart an engagement ring.
 She took everything, everything I gave her, oh sweet sixteen.
 Built a moon for a rocking chair.
 I never guessed it would rock her far from here, oh, oh, oh, oh.
 Someone's built a candy castle for my sweet sixteen.
 Someone's built a candy brain and filled it in.
 Well I'll do anything, for my sweet sixteen

 Oh I'll do anything for little runaway child
 Well, memories will burn you, memories grow older as people can
 They just get colder like sweet sixteen
 Oh, I see it's clear baby, that you are
 All through here, oh, oh, oh, oh.
 Someone's built a candy castle for my sweet sixteen.
 Someone's built a candy house to house her in.

 Someone's built a candy castle for my sweet sixteen.
 Someone's built a candy brain and filled it in.
 Well I'll do anything, for my sweet sixteen
 Oh I'll do anything for little runaway girl
 Yeah, sad and lonely and blue.   yeah, gettin' over you.
 How, how do you think it feels yeah
 To get up in the morning, get over you,
 Up in the morning, get over you,
 Wipe away the tears, get over you, get over, get over ...
