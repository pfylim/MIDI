INXS - THE ORIGINAL SIN

You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know
Of the murder committed
In the name of love, yeah?
You thought: what a pity
Dream on, white boy
Dream on, black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream
And it's held by many
Well, I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms
Dream on, white boy
Dream on, black girl
And wake up to a brand new day

Dream on, white boy
Dream on, black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

Dream on
Play with fire
White boy, black girl

Dream on
In the name of love
Black boy, white girl

Dream on
White boy, black girl
Black boy, white girl

Dream on
In the name of love, yeah
You thought: what a pity
