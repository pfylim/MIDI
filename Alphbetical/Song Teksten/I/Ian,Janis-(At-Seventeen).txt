      I learned the truth at seventeen

      That love was meant for beauty queens

      And high schoolgirls with clear skinned smiles

      Who married young and then retired

      
      The valentines I never knew , the friday night charades of youth

      were spent on one more beautiful

      At seventeen I learned the truth

      
      And those of us with ravaged faces, lacking in the social graces

      Desp'rately remained at home, inventing lovers on the phone

      Who called to say, come dance with me

      And murmured vague obscenities

      It isn't all it seems, at seventeen


      A brown eyed girl in hand me downs, 

      whose name I never could pronounce, said

      Pity please the ones who serve, they only get what they deserve

      The rich relationed home town queen, marries into what she needs

      With a guarantee of company and haven for the elderly

      REMEMBER THOSE WHO WIN THE GAME, LOSE THE LOVE THEY SOUGHT TO GAIN

      IN DEBENTURES OF QUALITY AND DUBIOUS INTEG'RITY

      THEIR SMALL TOWN EYES WILL GAPE AT YOU, 

      IN DULL SURPRISE WHEN PAYMENT DUE,EXCEEDS ACCOUNTS RECEIVED AT 17


      SOLO


      To those of us who know the pain,of valentines that never came

      And those whose names were never called,when choosing sides

      for basketball

      It was long ago and far away, the world was younger than today

      And dreams were all they gave for free,to ugly duckling girls

      like me

      WE ALL PLAY THE GAME AND WHEN WE DARE

      TO CHEAT OURSELVES AT SOLITAIRE,INVENTING LOVERS ON THE PHONE

      REPENTING OTHER LIVES UNKNOWN, THAT CALL AND SAY
      
      COME DANCE WITH ME AND MURMUR VAGUE OBSCENITIES AT UGLY GIRLS

      LIKE ME , AT SEVENTEEN
