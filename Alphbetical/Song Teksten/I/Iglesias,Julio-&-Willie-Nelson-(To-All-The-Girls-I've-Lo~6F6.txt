                        TO ALL THE GIRLS I'VE LOVED BEFORE

     As performed by: Julio Iglesias & Willie Nelson
     

     W.N.
     To all the girls I've loved before....
     who travelled in an' out my door....
     I'm glad they came along,..I dedicate this song...
     to all the girls I've loved before.....

     J.I.
     To all the girls I once..caressed.....
     an' may I say I've had the best....
     for helping me to grow, I owe a lot, I know..
     to all the girls I-I've loved before

     TOGETHER
     The winds of change are always blowin'.....
     an' ev'ry time I tried to stay.....
     the winds of change continued blowin'.....
     an' they jus' carried me away.....

     W.N.
     To all the girls who shared my life....
     who now are someone else's wife....
     Im glad they came along,...
     I dedicate this so-ong..to all the girls I've loved before...         
              
     J.I.
     To all the girls who cared for me,....
     who filled my nights with ecstasy,...
     they live within my heart, I'll always be a part..
     of all the girls I've loved before....
    
     TOGETHER
     The winds of change are always blowin'.....
     an' ev'ry time I tried to stay.....
     the winds of change continued blowin'.....
     an' they jus' carried me away...............
    
     (J.I.) To all the girls we've loved before.....
     (W.N.) who travelled in an' out our door...
     (J.I.) we're glad they came along,..
     (W.N.) we dedicate this song..
     (TOGETHER) to all the girls we've loved before.....

     (W.N.) To all the girls we've loved before.....
     (J.I.) who travelled in an' out our door...
     (W.N.) we're glad they came along,..
     (J.I.) we dedicate this song..
     (TOGETHER) to all the girls we've loved.....before............
