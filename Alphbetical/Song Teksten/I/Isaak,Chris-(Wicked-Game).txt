Title  : Wicked Game
Singer : Chris Isaak


The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I never dreamed I'd love somebody like you
I don't want to fall in love with you

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you
And I don't want to fall in love with you
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love
No I don't want to fall in love with you
This world is only gonna break your heart
