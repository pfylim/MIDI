MEMPHIS TENNESSEE - THE LORDS


Long distance information, give me Memphis Tennessee
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call
'Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall.

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on th southside, high up on a ridge,
Just a half a mile from th Mississippi Bridge.

Help me, information, more than that I can not add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart, because her Mum did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee.

Last time I saw Marie, she's wavin' me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickl'd from the eye.
Marie is only six years old, information please, 
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee.
