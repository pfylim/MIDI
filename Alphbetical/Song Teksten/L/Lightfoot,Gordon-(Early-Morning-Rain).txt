Titel:            EARLY MORNING RAIN

Interpret:        GORDON LIGHTFOOT



In the early morning rain
with no dollar in my hand,
with an achin in my heartand the pockets full of sand.
I'm a long way from home,
Lord I miss my loved one so
in the early morning rain
with no place to go.

Out on runway number nine, gib seven-o-seven set to go,
but I'm stuck here in the grass where the cold wind blows.
Now the liquor tastet good and the women all were fast;
well, there she goes, my friend, she's rollin' now at last.

Hear the mightly engines roar, see the silver bird on high.
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly.
Where the mornin' rain don't fall and the sun always shines.
She'll be flyin' o'er my home in about three hours time.
