Title  : WHAT'S ANOTHER YEAR

(Words & music: Shay Healy)

I've been waiting such a long time
Looking out for you 
But you're not here
What's another year

I've been waiting such a long time
Reaching out for you
But you aren't near
What's another year

What's another year
For someone who's lost
Everything that he owns
What's another year
For someone who's getting used to being alone

I've been praying such a long time
It's the only way
To hide the fear
What's another year?
