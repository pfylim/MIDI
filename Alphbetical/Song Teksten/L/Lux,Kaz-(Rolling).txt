Title  : ROLLING

(Words & music: Randy Newman)

I never drink in the afternoon
I never drink alone
But I sure do like a drink or two

Chorus:
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more
Rollin', rollin'
Ain't gonna worry no more
Used to worry about gamblin'
And throwin' my money away
Used to worry about wastin' time
And laying round the house all day
But I'm alright, I'm alright now
I never thought I'd make it
But I always do somehow
I'm alright now

Every evening what I do
I sit here in this chair
I pour myself some whiskey
And watch my troubles vanish into the air

Chorus: ...
