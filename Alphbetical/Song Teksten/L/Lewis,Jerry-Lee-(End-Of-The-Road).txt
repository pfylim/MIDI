Well, the way is dark, the night is long;
I don't care if I never get home.
I'm waitin' at the end of the road.
Well, the stars may not shine and neither the moon,
what the heck, we don't want no moon;
I'm waitin' at the end of the road.

You can jump in my Ford and give her the gas,
pull out the throttle; don't give me no sass.
Take your foot, slap it on the floor,
and when you get home we'll rock some more.
Well, the way is dark, the night is long;
I don't care if I never get home.
I'm waitin' at the end of the road.
