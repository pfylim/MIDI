Title  : SCARLET LADY

Last night about eleven o'clock mayor
Davis walked into his room
When he left I was fifty dollars richer
I had a bottle of French perfume
Lotsa ladies 'round here like to see me in jail
But they'll never see me there
'Cause there ain't a judge in the country
hasn't sat in my velvet chair

Refrain:
Scarlet lady waits for you in my room
just down the hall
Mirror on the ceiling who's the fairest
one of all
Lying in my big brass bed I've learned
my lessons well
Scarlet lady never give away what you can sell

I get them when they're just sixteen
And I get them when they're sixty-five
They come in feelin' full of the devil
And they leave about half-alive
There's a new grand piano in the living room
And closets full of fancy clothes
You may not think it's much of a life
But that's the one I chose

Refrain: ...

It's half past ten on a saturday night
Busy like the one before
But I always have time for the governor
When he comes to my back door
So don't you worry 'bout this scarlet lady
When you see her growin' old
My diary's just a little black book
But I'll turn it into gold

Refrain: ...
