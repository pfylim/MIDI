
6. Fallin' In Love - LA BOUCHE

Baby baby, falling in love, falling in love again
Everyday I love you more and more and more.

I could never see
What fate had planned to me
And then you came and made a dream
My reality.
Maybe you can't see 
all the things you've lead to me
Well my simple fate is at the gate 
Boy you got the key
It seems like yestarday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know 
How love can grow with each and every day.
As we lay in the midnight hour, 
And feel loves hidden power
So strong and bold as life
Unfolds the mistery to me.

Refrain

I never dream that my summertime flame
could show me
How much pleasure the winter can bring
Hooked up the fireplace 
time I don't waste
As i love you slow
Then increase the pace
Your natural body perfume
Brighten up any room
One whiff and my spirits taken up lift
It feels good
When your woman is your best friend
But it's better when you fall in love again.

Refrain
