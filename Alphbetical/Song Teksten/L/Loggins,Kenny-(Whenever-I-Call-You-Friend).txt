Title  : WHENEVER I CALL YOU FRIEND

(Words & music: K. Loggins/M. Manchester)

Whenever I call you friend
I begin to think I understand
Any where we are
You and I have always been
Ever and ever

I see myself within your eyes
And that's all I need to show me why
Everything I do will always
Take me home to you
Ever and ever

Now I know my life has given me
More than memories 
Day by day we can see
In every moment there's a reason to carry on

Sweet love's showing us a heavenly light
Never seen such a beautiful sight
See love glowing on us every night
I know forever we'll be doing it

Whenever I call you friend
I believe I've come to understand
Everywhere we are
You and I were meant to be
Forever and ever

I think about the times to come
Knowing I will be the lucky one
And ever you love will last
I always want to call you friend
