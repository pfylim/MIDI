Titel:            IF I HAD A HAMMER

Interpret:        TRINI LOPEZ


If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning,
I'd hammer in the ev'ning all, over this land,
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out warning,
I'd hammer out love between my brothers and my sister.
Oh, oh all over this land.

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning,
I'd ring it in the ev'ning, all over this land.
I'd ring it out danger, I'd ring it out warning,
i'd ring it out love between my brothers and my sisters,
oh, oh, all over this land.

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning,
I'd sing it in the ev'ning, all over this land.
I'd sing out danger, I'd sing out warning,
I'd sing out love between my brother and my sisters,
oh, oh, all over this land.

If I got a hammer and I got a bell
and  I got a song to sing, all over this land.
It's a hammer of justice, it's a bell of freedom,
it's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters,
oh, oh, all over this land.
