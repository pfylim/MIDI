Title  : ONE MORE LITTLE KISSIE

(Words & music: ?)

It's cold, I feel cold and I wonder what time in the morning
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home
Come a little closer before, yeah, before it's a-dawning
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home

Hold me close, hold me near
'Cause I know you'll disappear
No, not htere, do it here
Know your sailing-time is near

Tell me when you're coming again, 'cause I
I like to look forward
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home

La lalalalala

One more little kissy, before you must go
One more little kissy, like the end of the show
If you say you love me, I will set you free
So see you next weekend,  hope wait and see

One more this, one more kiss, if you love me
Let you go, here we go

La lalalalala

Baby, come on home, our time will too soon be all over
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home
Grant me just a few of your hours to live in clover
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home

What a life, it's no life livin' just for the wee, for the weekend
Time is a time, is a time, is a time to go home
