Singer : LEFTSIDE 
Title  : TESSIE

And now we're both on our own
And both we are all alone
I realize what I've always known
Tessie, I love you

And here it comes our last goodbye
And both we smile, our last sad lie
Behind that mask, I know that I
Tessie, I love you

I love you so much that tears will come
Tonight when I am all alone
But men are not supposed to cry
I will, just because I
I love you, Tessie

Have you been wrong, have I been right
The truth ain't black, the truth ain't white
And love has nothing to do with pride
Tessie, I love you
