LEVEL 42 - TAKE A LOOK

(Words & music: M. King/R. Gould/M. Lindup/W. Badarou)

I'm ragged man with a ragged heart
But I wear my soul with pride
You can see me on the road
See me carrying my home
And perhaps it seems that I'm all alone
But I'm happy here inside
You can keep your fancy dress
'Cause to me you don't impress

When I look in your face
That camera smile looks out of place on you
And by the look in your eyes
I can see you realize

So lend yourself to me
I'll show you what could be

Well I've come so far down so many roads
I've experienced your pain
You know that that's a fact
I can see the way you act
But I learnt to see what was wrong with me
And I know I've made mistakes
But I also made the break
You surround yourself
With secrets you are afraid to show the world
You convince yourself
There's no other way to go don't you
See the smile on my face (on my face)
Does it look so out of place

So lend yourself to me
I'll show you what could be yes I will

So many ways
For you to spend the passing days

Loving and living or losing and using
Life is forgiving so use it well
Feeling revealing or wheeling and dealing
Life's not for stealing and time will tell
(Loving and living or losing and using)
Take a look at your face
(Feeling revealing or wheeling and dealing)
(Life is not for stealing and time will tell)

You must surely know
If man made heaven
Then man made hell
So take a look at yourself

What's this secret you can't tell me
And when I look in your face
I see that smile so out of place on you
And by the look in your eyes
I can see you realize oh woh
