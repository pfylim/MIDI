Title  : JUMP TO THE BEAT
Artist : STACY LATTISAW

(Words & music: Narada Michael Walden/Lisa Walden)

Chorus:
Come on and jump to the beat
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me?)
Come on and jump to the beat
Come on and dance with me
(Won't you dance with me?)

You're unsurpassed in style
The price you paid was dear
You make the moves come alive
Yet movements dance with fear
Your specialty is lonely nights
As you and pride compete
Neglect the pain you hide
Come on and dance with me

Chorus: ...2x...

You'd rather dance alone
When love steps too near
Communicate with me
Youre doubts will disappear
If it's love you're searching for
There's plenty love in me
Embrace the good things in life
Come on and dance with me

Chorus: ...
