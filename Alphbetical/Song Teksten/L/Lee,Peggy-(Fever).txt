   Never know how much I love you,

   Never know how much I care

   When you put your arms around me

   I get a fever that's so hard to bear

   You give me fever, when you kiss me,

   Fever when you hold me tight

   Fever ! in the morning, fever all through the night

   
   Sunlights up the daytime, moon lights up the night

   I light up when you call my name

   And you know I'm gonna treat you right

   You give me fever, when you kiss me,

   Fever when you hold me tight

   Fever ! in the morning, fever all through  the night

   Every body's got the fever, that is someting you all know

   Fever is, such a new thing, fever started long ago
  
   Romeo love Juliet, Juliet she felt the same

   When he puts his arms around her,

   He said July baby you're my fame

   You give me fever......enz.

   Now you listen to my story

   Here's the point that I have made

   Chicks were born to give you fever

   Be it Fahrenheit or Sen the great, they give you fever

   When you kiss them, if you live or learn

   Fever! till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn

   What a lovely way to burn, what a lovely way to burn......
