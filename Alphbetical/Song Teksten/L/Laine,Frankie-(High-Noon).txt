
10. HIGH NOON - FRANKIE LANE

Do not forsake me oh my darling.
On this our wedding day.
Do not forsake me oh my darling.          
Wait, wait long.

I do not know what fate awaits me.
I only know I must be brave.
For I must face the man who hates me.
Or lie a coward, a craven coward.
Or lie a coward in my grave.

Oh to be torn towards love and duty.
S`pose then I`ll lose my fair haired beauty.
Look at that big hen move along.
Nearing high noon.
He made a vow while in State prison.
Vowed it would be my life or his then.
I`m not afraid of death but oh.
What shall I do if you leave me.

Do not forsake me oh my darling.   
You made that promise as a bride.
Do not forsake me oh my darling.   
Although you`re grieving, don`t think of leaving.
Now that I need you by my side.
Wait, wait long.
Wait, wait long...
