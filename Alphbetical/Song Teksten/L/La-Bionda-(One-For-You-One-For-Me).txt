Singer : LA BIONDA 
Title  : ONE FOR YOU, ONE FOR ME 
 
(Words & music: R.W. Palmer/James) 
 
One for you, one for me (10x) 
 
Please don't go away 
I'm ready and I'm able 
Please don't go away 
Till morning comes around 
 
Please don't go away 
My wine is on the table 
Please don't go away 
Just lay your body down 
 
Now I don't know what I would do 
If you get up to leave 
My jealous heart has slipped inside 
And know you almost leave 
'Cause I can show a girl like you 
Such loving and affection 
And I don't want to make no speech 
This hearing is no election 
 
Please don't go away 
I need change you mind to stay 
Hope you'll find a way 
I just love to hear you say 
 
One for you, one for me (6x)
