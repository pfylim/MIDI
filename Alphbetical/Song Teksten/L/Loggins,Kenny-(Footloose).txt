I've been working so hard . I'm punchin' my card.
Eight hours , for what ? Oh , tell me what I got ?
I've got this feelin' , that time's just holdin' me down.
I'll hit the ceilin' , or else I'll tear up this town.

Tonight I gotta cut loose , footloose , kick off your Sunday shoes.
Please , Louise , pull me off of my knees , Jack , get back ,
Come on before we crack , lose your blues ,ev'rybody cut footloose.

You're playin' so cool , obeying every rule.
Dig  way down in your heart , you're burnin' , yearnin' for some ,
Somebody to tell you that life ain't a-passing you by.
I'm tryin' to tell you that it will if you don't even try .

You can fly if you'd only cut loose , footloose ,
Kick off your Sunday shoes . Ooh-ee , Marie , shake it , shake it for me.
Oh , Milo , come on ,come on  let's go.
Lose your blues , ev'rybody cut footloose.

Cut footloose , ev'rybody cut footloose , ev'rybody cut footloose.
You've got to turn me around ,and put your feet on the ground.
Now , take a hold of your soul.

I'm tellin' loose , footloose  , kick off your Sunday shoes ...
Footloose , kick off your Sunday shoes . ...
Ev'rybody cut , ev'rybody cut , ev'rybody cut , ev'rybody cut,
Ev'rybody cut , ev'rybody cut footloose.
