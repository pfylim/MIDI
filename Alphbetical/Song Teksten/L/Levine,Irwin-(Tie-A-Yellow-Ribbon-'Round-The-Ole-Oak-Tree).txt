I'm coming home I've done my time
now I've got to know what is and isn't mine
if you received my letter tellin' you
I'd soon be free.
Then you'll know just what to do
if you still want me
if you still want me.

Well tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
it's been three long years do ya still want me ?
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us,
put the blame on me.
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree.

Bus driver please look for me
'cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see
I'm really still in prison
and my love she holds the key
a simple yellow ribbon's
what I need to set me free
I wrote and told her please

Well tie a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
it's been three long years do ya still want me ?
If I don't see a yellow ribbon 'round the ole oak tree
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us,
put the blame on me.
If hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole the ole oak tree.

Now the whole damn bus is cheering 
and I can't believe I see a
hundred yellow ribbons 'round the ole the ole oak tree.
