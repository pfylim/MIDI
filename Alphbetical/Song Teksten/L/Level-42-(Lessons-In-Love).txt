LEVEL 42 - LESSONS IN LOVE


I'm not proud
I was wrong
And the truth was hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Life boat lies
Lost at sea
I've been trying to reach you shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better
Should be better - oh
Lessons in love

Oh restless eyes
Egos burn
And the mood is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts
Token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better
Should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it
We could use it, yeah
Lessons in love

(Lost without love)
Lost without love
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait till you return

(instrumental)

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived in
We should use it
We could lose it
Lessons in love
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better
Should be better, yeah
Lessons in love
If we use the time before us
The future will restore us
Could get better
Should get better
Lessons in love
