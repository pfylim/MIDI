Title  : YES, I DO

(Words & music: Hans van Hemert)

Fancy talking, yes I do
Fancy walking, oh yes I do
Would you care to join me for a drink tonight?
Yes I, yes I, yes I do

Fancy dancin, yes I do
Fancy kissin', oh yes I do
Would you care to join me for the rest of my life?
Yes I, yes I, yes I do

Chorus:
Dum, dum, darling, I love yu
Do, do, do dum, darling, I love you
Tell me do, do you think I'm too fast?
Does, does it make me look bad?
Dum, dum, darling, I love you
To-to-to-to-tonight

Do you swear to, yes I do
Tell the truth, oh yes I do
Would you like to marry, marry me?
Oh oh oh oh will you take this?
Oh, yes I do
Wed the husband
Oh, yes I do
Love and keep him till death do you part
Yes I, yes I, yes I will

Chorus: ...
