Singer : LONG TALL ERNIE & THE SHAKERS 
Title  : OPERATOR, OPERATOR (GET ME A LINE)

Well it's one, two, three, I can't remember
Well it's four, five, six to get your line
Well at seven, eight, nine ten I'll be in heaven
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love

Your number one, two, three it rings forever
Come on four, five, six, it's taking time
Well at seven, eight, nine, ten I'll be in heaven
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love

Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line

Well at one, two, tree, it's no connection
And number four, five, six a waste of time
I hope seven, eight, nine, ten I'll be in heaven
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love
'Cause all I want yes all I want is your love

Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
Operator, operator, get me a line
