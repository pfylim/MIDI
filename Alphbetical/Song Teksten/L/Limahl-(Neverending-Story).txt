Turn around look at what you see in her face the mirror of your dream
make believe on every when gettin in the lights

neverending story ah ah ah

and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a never ending story

in your hands the birth of a new day

and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a 
never ending story ah ah ah
