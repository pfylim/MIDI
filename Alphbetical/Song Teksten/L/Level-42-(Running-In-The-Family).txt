                             RUNNING IN THE FAMILY

     As performed by: Level 42           


     Our dad..would send us to our room, he'd be the voice of doom,
     he said that we would thank him later.. 
     all day he was solid as a rock 
     but by eight o'clock we'd be crumbling..

     One night,  my brother Joe and me, climbed down the famliy tree..
     that grew outside our bedroom window..
     we ran though we knew it couldn't last, running from the past,
     things that we were born to be

     Lookin' back, it's so biza-a-arre,..it runs in the family,..
     all the things we are, on the back seat of the car-a-ar,
     with Joseph an' Emily,.. we only see so far...
     and we all have our daddy's eyes, lookin' back it's so biza-a-arre...

     BRIDGE..........................................................

     Dad rang..the officer in charge, a man so large,
     he barely fit his circumstances, he said, two kids out on the street,
     were picked up on the beat and in the station...

     So there's me..with Emily and Joe and daddy driving home,
     all heading in the same direction..
     he knew, no matter what the breaks, we'd make the same mistakes,
     couldn't take his eyes off Joe and me

     Lookin' back, it's so biza-a-arre,..it runs in the family..
     all the things we are, on the back seat of the car-a-ar,
     with Joseph and Emily-y,..we only see so far..
     and we all have our daddy's eyes
     lookin' back it's so biza-a-arre, it runs in the family-y...
     all the things we are, lookin' back, it's so biza-a-a-a-arre

     Like a dream within a dream, we're all somewhere in betwee-een
     (ooh-ooh ooh--ooh) like a drummer plays his drum or a father,
     like a so-o--n (ooh-ooh ooh-----ooh---)
     you're gonna have to face the music,..oh yeah,..face the music---

     Hey-ey, hey,--- we keep it runnin' in the family,.....
     hey-ey, hey,--- we keep on comin' in the family.....

     Lookin' back, it's so biza--a-arre, 
     it runs in the family-y...all the things we are,
     on the back seat of the car-a-ar, with Joseph an' Emily-y,..
     we only see so far,..'cause we all have our daddy's eyes
     lookin' back it's so bizarre, woa-oh yeah-ea-eah!..
     running in the family,..........running in the family..
     and we all have our daddy's eyes..lookin' back it's so bizarre,
     woa-oh yeah-ea-eah!..running in the family,.....
