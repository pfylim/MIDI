LIVING IN A BOX - BLOW THE HOUSE DOWN 

All alone in the crowd 
Trying not to think out loud 
Whispers shout, whispers scream 
Together we can make it a dream 
Mountains high, mountains low 
Without a bridge you mind how you go 
And what you need is what I want 
So don't be afraid just let it show 
Don't be afraid just let it explode 
 
refrain: 
We have got the power to  
build the highest tower 
Standing with our feet on the ground 
We've got what it takes 
Together we can blow the house down 
Blow the house down 
 
Silent words in your eyes 
Hiding in a lover's disguise 
And as my heart steals your mind 
Together we'll be partners in crime 
Deserts dry don't you know 
Without the water no river flows 
And what you need is what I want 
So don't be afraid just let it explode 
 
refrain: ... 
 
Mountains high, mountains low 
Without a bridge you mind how you go 
And what you need is what I want 
So don't be afraid let it show 
Don't be afraid just let it explode
