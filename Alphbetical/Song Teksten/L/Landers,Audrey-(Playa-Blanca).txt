AUDREY LANDERS - PLAYA BLANCA

There is a place that I dream of
With beautiful white sand
Sitting in a silver bay
I see the shimmering water
The shade from the palmtrees
I could sit and dream all day
I feel the warmth of the sunshine
Touching the white shore
Seagulls dancing on the sea
I see the boats in the distance
And out on the horizon
Sailing to my fantasy

Refrain:
Playa Blanca
Playa Blanca
The special magic feeling floats through the air
I feel the happiness and love everywhere
Playa Blanca
Playa Blanca
And when I come back to you some day
I'm gonna stay

There is a place that I dream of
With beautiful white sand
Gentle breezes to my hair
I hear the sound of the water
Echoing to me
I can't wait to be back there
I see a splash in the nightsky
A rainbow of colors
Lighting of my fantasy
And very soon of the feeling
The blow of the evening
That's the place I long to be

Refrain: ...
