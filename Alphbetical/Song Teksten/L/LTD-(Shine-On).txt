Title  : SHINE ON
Artist : LTD

(Words & music: J. Osborne/B. Osborne/R. Kerr)

Just yesterday, I cast my eyes upon your lovely face
But that was yesterday
Now just a dream
A dream that lives inside my memory
Wish it could be reality

Chorus:
Shine on yesterday
Carry me away, and let me be back in your arms
Holding you again
Shine on yesterday
Carry me away to be with you
Somehow let my dream come true

You know, sometimes I stop and stare no matter where I am
Thinking of you again
Once in a while, I call your name out loud
Hoping you'll hear
Hoping my prayer, will bring you here

Chorus: ...

Shine on yesterday
Carry me away and let me be back in your arms
Holding you again
Shine on yesterday
Carry me away and let me be back in your arms
Holding you again
Carry me away to be with you
Because this is for me
My one and only dream
I ever wanted to come true
