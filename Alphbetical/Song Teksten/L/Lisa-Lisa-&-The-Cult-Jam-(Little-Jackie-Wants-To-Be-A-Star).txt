LISA LISA & THE CULT JAM - LITTLE JACKIE WANTS TO BE A STAR

(Words & music: ...)

Oh, little Jackie (little Jackie)
Alright

Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star

She got off the Greyhound
And searched her fortune and fame
Hoping to find, a better way
And leave her troubles behind
Little did she know, they like the sometimes watch and go ????
Some of them get there, open your eyes, so you live to regret it

Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's gone in the middle
Of reality and what she's dreaming of
Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smacked out in the middle of) oh of growing up

(Time Square) Is this where she makes it
(Some people never get there)
There she met a guy (so fine)
But it wasn't 'bout nothing but forth from behind
Jackie say no (you gotta change her) rearrange her (rearrange her)
Remember what your mama then told you
Never ever take kiss from a stranger

Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's gone in the middle
Of reality and what she's dreaming of
Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smacked out in the middle of) oh of growing up

(Guitar solo)
I'm talking 'bout, I said I'm talking 'bout Jackie oh
Ooh man, oh yeah

All the glitters ain't gold (don't make a regress for ya)
You're only sixteen years old (don't let the streets try to rule ya)
You never meant to be a runaway, oh no no no no no no ho
There's got to be a better way, today, today
Talking about Jackie (I believe ya, I believe ya)
(If you grew you gotta suffer, really guess you wanna make it)
Well if ya got my meaning, then you constant get the feeling
Yeah, yeah

Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
She's gone in the middle
Of reality and what she's dreaming of
Oh, little Jackie she wants to be a star
(Smacked out in the middle of) oh of growing up
Ooh
