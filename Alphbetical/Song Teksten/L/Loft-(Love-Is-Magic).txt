  7. LOVE IS MAGIC (LOFT)
  
  LOVE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
  WRONG I'M NOT TALKING SHOW BIZ
  LIFE IS WHAT YOU GOT TO LIVE
  SOME TRY TO TAKE
  'N' SOME TRY TO GIVE
  BUT IT'S REAL
  YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
  THIS LOVE IS IT WHAT IT SEEMS
  THIS TIME COULD IT BE A DREAM
  LIFE I LIKE HOW IT FEELS
  WHY DO YOU ALWAYS ACT SO SHY
  IT HURTS SO BAD WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYE
  
  IT SEEMS
  AS IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO CRY
  A LOOK IN DI SKY
  'N' ASK MYSELF WHY
  WHY DON'T YOU GIVE
  DI DREADLOCKS A TRY
  THE LOVE I HAVE
  WILL MAKE YOU HIGH
  DON'T LET IT PASS YOU BY
  
  LIFE YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
  WRONG I'M NOT TALKING LIMOUSINES
  LOVE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS
  IT'S TO CARE TO SHARE
  TO LIVE 'N' TO GIVE
  IN LIFE YOU GOT TO BE POSITIVE
  YOU GOT TO LOVE DI LIFE
  DI LIFE THAT YOU LIVE
  WITHOUT LOVE YOU'RE NOTHING AT ALL
  YOU'RE ANOTHER LOSER
  WITH YOUR BACK ON THE WALL
  FIGHTING
  TO PREVENT YOUR OWN DOWNFALL
  BUT IN LOVE YOU'RE STANDING TALL
  IN LIFE YOU NEED LOVE TO LIVE
  YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE MORE CONSTRUCTIVE
  HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND KNOW
  WHEN TO FORGIVE
  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
  AND BEING NEGATIVE
  IN THE FATHER'S EYES
  WE'RE RELATIVES
  ONLY LOVE THAT I'M HERE TO GIVE
