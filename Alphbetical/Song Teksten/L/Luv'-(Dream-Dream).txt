Title  : DREAM, DREAM

(Words & music: Janschen/Janschens)

When I turn over the leaves of this book
I see the picture again which you took
I do remember you had a sign
Something that had to convince me that time

That latest letter you send me that day
There was the headline
That showed me the way
Two yellow roses tried to explain
That was the sign
That you loved me again

And when I knocked on your door
I said the simple words
I love you too

Chorus:
Dream, dream, beautiful dream
I'm not leaving you anymore
Bye, bye, I say goodbye
Dream, dream, beautiful dream
Sneak away through the open door
It ain't no use to try me
It ain't no use to buy me love

And from that day we're together again
I see the sunshine instead of the rain
Every year on this particular day
Two yellow roses are tied to loving
When I got out for shopping or so
On my way back I feel how my love grows
I know that you'll never leave me no more

Chorus: ...2x...
