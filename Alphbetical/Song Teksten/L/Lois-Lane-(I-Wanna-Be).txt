Title  : I Wanna Be
Singer : Lo‹s Lane


Since you came into my life
My life is changing
It's getting better all time
Since you came
Since you are mine
There's only one thing that's going through my mind
I just wanna be with you

I wanna be at your side
I wanna be in your mind
I wanna, I wanna be, I wanna be with you
Wanna be at your side
Wanna be in your mind

Since you came
Since you are mine
I got this felling that nothing will ever be the same
'Cause you've got a hold on me so tight
That I can't sleep at night
And there's only one thing that's going through my mind
I just wanna be with you
