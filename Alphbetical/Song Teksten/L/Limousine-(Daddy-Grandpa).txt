Title  : DADDY GRANDPA

Daddy daddy grandpa was the leading man
Daddy daddy grandpa sold us out again
He gave us only words most of them were lies
The more he cheated the more we realized
Daddy daddy grandpa was the leading man

Daddy daddy grandpa couldn't do a thing but steal
He smiled when he signed a contract none of them were real
He didn't split the money when he sold the van
He grabbed it all and then he ran
Daddy daddy grandpa was the leading man

And in the meantime we were growin' into fame
It was kind of hard to forget his name
He left a trace in all of our brains
Daddy daddy grandpa daddy daddy grandpa daddy daddy grandpa

Daddy daddy grandpa was not a type to stay
He didn't do his function it's easy now to say
Sometimes he used to change his style
Worked out only for a while
Only one or two of us could take it with a smile
Daddy daddy grandpa was the leading man
