
                 It`s over             Level 42                  


I won't be here when you come home,
I'm sorry if you don't understand, 
forgive me if you ca-a-an,
but I can see another road, an' I ain't comin' back.

Don't look for me around this town,
'cause I will be so far away, you'll never find me a-anywhere,
an' I won't take no souvenirs, no perfumed picture promises,
because it's over, an' I ain't comin' back.

You gave me e-ev'rything, an' now I'm breaking your heart,
you know tha-at I don't mean, to tear your world apart.

I would never leave if I thought you couldn't stand the pain,
a letter in the hall, is written on the wall,
a letter with no words of love at all, because it's over,
(because it's over) an' I ain't comin' back.

And as I-I close the door, I know I'm breakin' your heart,
yea-ea-eah, I should ha-ave loved you-ou more,
instead I've torn your world apart.

And as I walk into the lonely afternoon,
I feel sad enough, I feel bad enoug,
and all the times when you are lonely where you are,
please don't hate me then, I just could not pretend, oh-oh-no,
(feel the tears, I can feel the tears),
(runnin' through the years),
(tears, feel the tears),
(I can feel the tears, runnin' through the years),
(tears, feel the tears, I can feel the tears),
(runnin' through the years).
