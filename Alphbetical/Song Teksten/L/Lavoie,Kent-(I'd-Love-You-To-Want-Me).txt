Titel:         I'D LOVE YOU TO WANT ME

Musik + Text:  KENT LAVOIE




When I saw you standin' there I bout fell out my chair and when you
moved your mouth to speak I felt the blood go to my feet.
Now it took time for me to know what you tried so not to show.
Somethin' in my soul just cries I see the want in your blue eyes.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby, I'd love you to want me the way that I want you the way that it
should be Baby, you'd love me to want you the way that I want to.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd only let it be. You told yourself years ago you'd never
let your feelings show the obligation that you made.
For the title that they gave.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby, I'd love you...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When I saw you standin' 

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby, I'd love you...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you'd only let it be !

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Baby, I'd love you...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
