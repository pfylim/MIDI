LEVEL 42 - TRACIE

Tracie-cie-cie-cie-cie

Steppin' out from underneath my shadow
Walking from home from Friday's nine to five
Rememberin' the long way round the meadow
The one we used to take from time to time

And I thought about you
How you must have changed now baby
Far away from me
How I used to savour all your kisses
Where no one else could see
And I wanna know

Tracie (Tracie) where are you now girl
(Where are you now)
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
And Tracie (Tracie) where have you been
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

Countin' by the street lights to the phone box
Where we used to meet before the dawn
And smokin' on the top floor of the school bus
Promising the moon as we rode along

But now I saw you across a crowded dance floor
Or somewhere in the town
Would you show me what I had been missing
And spin me round and round woh-woh

Tracie (Tracie) where are you now girl
(Where are you now)
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
And Tracie (Tracie) where have you been
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

('Cause deep inside from some other place)
(I turn to find we're there face to face)
(We laugh we cry we work and we play)
(As love filled night gives way to the day ooh ooh)

Tracie (Tracie) where are you now girl
(Where are you now)
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
And Tracie (Tracie) where have you been
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

Tracie (Tracie) where are you now girl
(Where are you now)
I don't know why this feeling's so strong
And Tracie (Tracie) where have you been
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You know there's no one now to tell us we're wrong

(Tracie where are you now)
