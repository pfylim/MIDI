LYLE LOVETT - STAND BY YOUR MAN

Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Givin' all your love to just one man
If you have bad times
And he'll have good times
Doin' things that you don't understand

But if you love him, you'll forgive him
Eventhough he's hard to understand
And if you love him, or be proud of him
'Cause after all he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you can
Stand by your man
