Mmm ah ah...
We can build it with love
Peace and happiness, oh
We can build it with hope
Faith, togetherness.

There are roads that divide us
In our separate lives
River deep, valley low and mountain high
And oh oh
We need a bridge between our lives
A bout of understanding for the other side
Let's build a bridge from me to you (ah...)
Not for the chosen few
But for everyone.

We can build it with love (love) 
We can build it with peace (peace)
We can build it with happiness (happiness), oh
If we can learn to believe (believe)
There's nothing we can't achieve (achieve) 
We can overcome the bitterness (bitterness)
Hey.

Just believe it.

Come on board
Set the sails of hope in motion, oh
Sure the boat
Feel the winds that change
They blow they blow they blow.

We need a bridge between our lives
A bout of understanding to stem the tide
Let's build a bridge from me to you (ah...)
Not for the chosen few
But for everyone.

We can build it with love
We can build it with peace
We can build it with happiness, come on 
If we can learn to believe
There's nothing we can't achieve
We can overcome the bitterness
Hey.

Yes, it will.
A little bit of bitterness.

Oh, we've got the power, people, flower, people
We've got the power
The knowledge to grow
The seeds to flower
The reaper to sow
It's all of the people
Working together
It's all of a sequel
No one is better
Power, people, flower, people
Power, people
Flower, people.
