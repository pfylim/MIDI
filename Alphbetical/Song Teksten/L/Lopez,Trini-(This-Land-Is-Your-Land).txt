Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land is your land, this land is my land
from California to the New York Island,
from the redwood forest to the gulf stream water,
this land was made for you and me.
--------------------------------------------------

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway,
I saw below me that golden valley, 
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land...
--------------------------------------------------

I roamed and rambled, and I followed my footsteps
to the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
all around me a voice was sounding,
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land...
--------------------------------------------------

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling,
and the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,
a voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land...
--------------------------------------------------

In the squares of the city by the shadow of the steeple
near the relief office I saw My people
and some were stumbling and some were wondering if
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land...
--------------------------------------------------

As I went rambling that dusty highway
I saw a sign that said privat property
but on the other side it didn't say nothing
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This land...
--------------------------------------------------

Nobody living can ever stop me
as I go walking my freedom highway
nobody living can make me turn back
this land was made for you and me.

Refrain:
--------------------------------------------------
This Land...
--------------------------------------------------
