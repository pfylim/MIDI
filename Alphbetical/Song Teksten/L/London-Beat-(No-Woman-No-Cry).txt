Title  : No Woman No Cry
Singer : Londonbeat


Ev'rything's gonna be alright (2x)
Well I remember when we used to set
In the garden yard in French town
Observing all the hypocrites as they would
Mingle with the good people we meet
Good friends we had - good friends we lost along the way
In this great future you can't forget the past
So dry your tears I say - I say
Ev'rything's gonna be alright
Yeah it's gonna be alright
Ev'rything's gonna be alright (2x)
Hush little sister
Ev'rything gonna be alright
Don't shed no tears
No woman no cry (4x)
Well I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in French town
And then Georgie - heah - would light the fire light
As it was logwood burning thru the night
Then we would cook some cornmeal porridge
Of which I'll share with you
You see my feet - are my only carriage
So I've got to push on thru
But while I'm gone and leave you
Ev'rything is gonna be alright (4x)
No woman no cry (4x)
Ev'rything's gonna be alright (4x)
