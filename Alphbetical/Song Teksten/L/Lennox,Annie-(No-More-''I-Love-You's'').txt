I used to be lunatic from the gracious days
I used to be woebegone and so restless nights
My aching heart would bleed, for you to see
Oh! but now
I don't find myself bouncing home
whistling buttonhole tunes to make me cry
No more "I love you's"
the language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting me outside the words
(The lover speaks about the monsters)
I used to have demons in my room at night
Desire; Despair; Desire so many monster
Oh! But now
I don't find myself bouncing home
Whistling bottonhole tunes to make me cry...
No more "I love you's"
the language is leaving me
No more "I love you's"
Changes are shifting me outside the words
