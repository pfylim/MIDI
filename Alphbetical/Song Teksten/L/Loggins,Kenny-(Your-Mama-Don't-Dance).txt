Your mama don't dance, and your daddy don't rock 'n' roll
but when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go? To rock 'n roll?

The old folks say that you got to end your date by ten
If you're out on a date and bring her home late, it's a sin
There just ain't no excuse, you know you're going to lose, you never win
I'll say it again

(and it's all because)

Your mama don't dance, and your daddy don't rock 'n' roll
Your mama don't dance, and your daddy don't rock 'n' roll
but when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go? To rock 'n roll?

You pulled into a drive-inn and you found a place to park
You hopped into the backseat where you know it's nice and dark
You're just about to move and thinking it's a breeze
There's a light in your eye and then a guy says
"Out of the car long hair!"
Ooo wee, you're coming with me said the local police

(and it's all because)
Your mama don't dance, and your daddy don't rock 'n' roll
Your mama don't dance, and your daddy don't rock 'n' roll
but when evening rolls around and it's time to go to town
Where do you go? To rock 'n roll?

Where do you go? To rock 'n roll?
Where do you go? To rock 'n roll?
