Singer : LIBERATION OF MAN 
Title  : LOVE IS UNDER CONTROL

Baby, you're playing a game
But I know you're not to blame (no, you're not to blame)
What you're talking about (what I'm talking about)
Got to get it together, work it all out
Lady, don't look at me so
I'm trying to be your lover, don't let me go (trying to be your man)
What you're trying to tell (what you're trying to tell)
Believe me baby I know so well

Love's under control
Love threw us together baby
Love we let it grow
Love we do it better, yeah

Baby, you're playing a game
But I know you're not to blame (no you're not to blame)
Try to pass you by (trying to pass you by)
But every time you catch my eye
Lady don't look at me so
I'm trying to be your lover, don't let me go (trying to be your man)
What you're trying to tell (what you're trying to tell)
Believe me baby, I know so well

Love is under control
Love threw us together baby
Love we let it grow
Love we do it better, yeah

Baby, you're all I need
Ah, to unchain my soul, I got your love
I get your love under control

Love's under control
Love threw us together baby
Love we let it grow
Love we do it better, yeah
