Ev'rybody loves somebody sometime,
ev'rybody falls in love somehow.

Something in your kiss just told me
my sometime is now.

Ev'rybody finds somebody someplace,
there's no telling where may appear.

Something in my heart keeps saying
my someplace is here.

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for ev'ry girl to have your charms.

Then ev'ry minute ev'ry hour
ev'ry boy would find what I found in your arms.

Ev'rybody loves somebody sometime
and, although my dream was overdue,
your love made it well worth waiting
for someone like you.
