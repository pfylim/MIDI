Title  : MAMA MIA (everytime I see ye)

What have you done to me signorina
When you walk you do it like a ballerina
Rome you got a lovely daughter
And I love her love her like no other

Ma ma ma mma Mamma Mia
Ooh, girl everytime I see ye
Ma ma ma mma Mamma Mia
Ooh, girl everytime I see ye

I don't want to go home
Never leave you
Never leave Rome without you
Oh you set my heart on fire

Papa and Mamma in Cincinnati
Will agree, ooh boy she is pretty
You are a lucky guy with a girl like this
Oh believe me got nothing more to wish

Ma ma ma mma Mamma Mia
Ooh, girl everytime I see ye
Ma ma ma mma Mamma Mia
Ooh, girl everytime I see ye
