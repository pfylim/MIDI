Ev'rything free in America, for a small fee in America!

Hey!
All day, all night, Marianne!
Down by the seaside, sitting there
Even little children love Marianne
Down by the seaside, sitting there

Bridge

Well I met my little brown-eyed girl - tell me where:
Chor: "Down by the riverside!" Hehe-he!
Chor: "Down by the riverside!" Way down!
Chor: "Down by the riverside!"
Well, I me-et my little brown-eyed girl
Chor: "Down by the riverside - down by the ri-ver-side!"

Bridge

Uhu-hu-hu
He-he-he!
Uhu-hu-hu
Aha-ha!

If I had a hammer, I'd hammer in the morning,
I'd hammer in the evening, all over this land!
I'd hammer out danger, I'd hammer out war-nings,
I'd hammer 'bout love between my brothers and my sisters - aha
All over this land - sing it ev'rybody:

Uhu-hu-hu, uhu-hu-hu

Bridge

Lalala lala lala lala-la...

Repeat and fade away
