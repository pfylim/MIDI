Well I'm all reved up and I'm ready, baby
you're a man and I'm a lady
you better turn your eyes from this body of mine
I don't want you to be ahead of our time.

I'll say when to stop
hey, I'll call the shots
baby I'll say when
say when,
I'll say when to stop,...

Well you look plenty good to me
you got plenty of energy
and I know that you're big and strong
but I'll be the boss, so don't go wrong.

I'll say when to stop,...

One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

Well I'm all reved up and I'm ready baby,...

I'll, say when to stop,...
