            STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - LED ZEPPELIN


            VSP


            There's a lady who's sure, all the glitters is gold
            and she's buying a stairway to heaven
            
            When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
            with a word she can get what she came for
            
            Oeh, oeh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

            There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
            cause you know sometimes words have two meanings

            In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
            sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

            Oeh, it makes me wonder (2 X)

            There's a feeling I get, when I look to the west
            And my spirit is crying for leaving

            In my thoughts I have seen, rings of smoke through the trees
            and the voices of those who stand looking

            Oeh, it makes me wonder
            Oeh, it really makes me wonder

            An dit whispered that soon if we all call the tune
            then the piper will lead us to reason
            
            And a new day will dawn, for those who stand long
            and the forests will echo with laughter

            Oooooowoooo

            If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
            it's just a spring clean for the may queen

            Yes there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
            There's still time to change the road you're on

            And it makes me wonder

            Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
            the piper's calling you to join him

            Dear lady can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
            Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

            SOLO

            AS WE WIND ON DOWN THE ROAD
            OUR SHADOWS TALLER THAN OUR SOUL
            THERE WALKS A LADY WE ALL KNOW
            WHO SHINES WHITE LIGHT AND WANTS TO SHOW
            HOW EVERYTHING STILL TURNS TO GOLD
            AND IF YOU LISTEN VERY HARD
            THE TUNE WILL COME TO YOU AT LAST
            WHEN ALL ARE ONE AND ONE IS ALL
            TO BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL

            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
