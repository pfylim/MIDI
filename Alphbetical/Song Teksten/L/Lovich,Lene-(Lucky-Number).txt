Title  : LUCKY NUMBER

(Words & music: Lovich/Chappell)

I never used to cry 'cos I was all alone
For me, myself and I, is all I've ever known
I never felt the need to have a hand to hold
In everything I do I take complete control
That's where I'm coming from, my lucky number's one
I've everything I need to keep me satisfied
There's nothing you can do to make me change my mind
I'm having so much fun, my lucky numbers' one

I now detect an alien vibration here
There's something in the air besides the atmosphere
The object of the action is becoming clear
And imminent attack upon my heart I fear
The evidence is strong, my lucky number's wrong

Something tells me my lucky number's gonna be changing soon
Something tells me my lucky number's gonna be you

You certainly do have a strange effect on me
Never thought that I could feel the way I feel
Now something in your eyes gives me a wild idea
I never want to be apart from you, my dear
I guess it must be true, my lucky number's two
This rearrangement suits me now, I must confess
That number one was dull and number two is best
I wanna stay with you, my lucky number's two
