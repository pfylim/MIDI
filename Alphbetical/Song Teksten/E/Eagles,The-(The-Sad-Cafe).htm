THE SAD CAFÉ
Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, and John David Souther

Eagles
The Long Run
1979

This is my favorite song off The Long Run, with a
beautiful melody and sweet harmonies, and an awfully
sad sound to it.  Henley does an incredible job with
the vocals too.  Don't forget the capo.

  Out in the shiny night the rain was softly falling
A			   Dm		 E	  E7	  A
  Tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling
And I remember the times we spent, outside the Sad Café

Oh it seemed like a holy place protected by amazing grace
We would sing right out loud those things we could not say
Thought we could change this world with words like love and freedom
And we were part of the lonely crowd outside the Sad Café

F#m	            C#m7
Oh expecting to fly
	   F#m					          Bm 	E
We would meet on that beautiful shore in the sweet by and by

Some of our dreams came true and some just passed away
And some of them stayed behind inside the Sad Café

Esus4	           E
The clouds roll in
Esus4	E
Hid that shore
Esus4	  E
Now that glory train
   Esus4		     E
It don't stop here no more

Dsus4		D		  Dsus4			  D
Now I look at the years gone by and wonder at the powers that be
Esus4			E	          Esus4			E
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and lets the rest go free

Maybe now that the time has drawn the faces I recall
But things in this life change very slowly if they ever change at all
There's no use in asking why, it just turned out that way
So meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
Why don't you meet me at midnight baby inside the Sad Café
