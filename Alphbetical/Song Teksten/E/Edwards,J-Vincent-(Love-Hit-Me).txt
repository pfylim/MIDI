Title  : LOVE HIT ME

(Words & music: J. Vincent Edwards)

When I saw your face, love hit me
And there was no where I could run
But my loneliness was over
And my life had just begun

When I saw your smile, love hit me
And I just couldn't turn away
I was hypnotised by your beauty
And I just had to say

Refrain:
Baby, let your love shine on
Keep it burning all night long
You can really turn me on
Oh honey you're the only one

Baby, let your love shine on
Keep it burning all night long
I can feel it coming on
Love hit me and it's going strong

Straight between the eyes, love hit me
You must have know this lonely boy
Needing, loving and affection
And that's why I can't avoid it

Standing out a mile, love hit me
Ever since you came my way
Now I believe in miracles
They happen every day

Refrain: ...
