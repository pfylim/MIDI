Title  : Bad Boy
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Bad boy, bad boy, bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy
Boys will be boys, bad boy, bad boy

(Boys will be boys)
Always get so restless
(Bad boy, bad boy, boys will be boys)
Nothin' but trouble
(Bad boy, bad boy, boys will be boys)
Get me feelin' breathless
(Bad boy, bad boy, boys will be boys)
Nothin' but trouble (Bad boy, bad boy)

Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
(You naughty) (I want you)
Bad bad bad bad boy
You make me feel so good
I knew you would

The way you hold me tight
You get me so excited
You do me oh so right
My hearts goes beat, beat beat, beat beat

And when he drives me home
I feel safe at night
He'll call me on the phone
It goes ring ring ring ring a ring ring
