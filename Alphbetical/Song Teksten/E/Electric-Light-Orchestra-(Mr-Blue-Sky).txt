Title  : MR. BLUE SKY

(Words & music: Jeff Lynne)

Sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city on the streets
Where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today

Chorus:
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long
Where did we go wrong
Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey you, with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration
Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for

Chorus: ...

Mr. Blue, you did right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this way

Chorus: ...
