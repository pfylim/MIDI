Title  : Nothin' New
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Why is nothing ever new for long
And things go wrong in time
How come love is never new for long
We feel a change inside
Things no longer feel the way they did
People never care the way the did
Lovers never love the way they did
We've got to make it last
Got to fan the spark

People know that love is often cruel
But still they fall in love
I believe that only goes to prove
That's love's what we dream of

Bridge:
Even if things can never be the way they were
But if you just hold on your luck might take a turn
We should put in practice
What we've learned
That love's the only way
We got to make it stay

Chorus:
Life goes on
Nothin's ever new
Maybe different that before
You may not believe me
But nothin's ever
Nothin's ever, nothin's ever new
Life goes on no matter what you do
And thought it's crazy, nothin's ever
Nothin's ever new
You may not believe me but it's true 
It may be different from before
But nothin's ever new

Bridge
