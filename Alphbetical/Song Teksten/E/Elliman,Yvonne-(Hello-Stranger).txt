(Words & music: Barbara Lewis)

Shoo-bab, shoo-bab, my baby
Shoo-bab, shoo-bab
Hello stranger
It seems so good
To see you back again
How long has it been

Refrain:
It seems like a mighty long time
Shoo-bab, shoo-bab, my baby ooh
It seems like a mighty long time

Oh my my my my
I'm so glad
You stopped by
To say hello to me
Remember that's the way
It used to be

Refrain: ...

Shoo-bab, shoo-bab, my baby
Shoo-bab, shoo-bab
I'm so glad
You're here again

Oh, if you're not gonna stay
Please don't tease me
Like you did before
Because I still love you so

Refrain: ...

Oh I, my my my
I'm so happy
You're here at last

Oh, seems like a mighty long time
It's so good to
Have you back home again
How long has it been
