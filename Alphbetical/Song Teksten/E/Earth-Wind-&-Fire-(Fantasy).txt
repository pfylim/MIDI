(Words & music: Maurice White/Verdine White/Eddie DelBarrio)

Every man has a place
In his heart there's a space
That the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasy
All your dreams will come true
Right away

And we'll live together
Until the twelfth of never
Our voices will sing forever
As one

Every thought is a dream
Rushing by in a stream
Bring life to your kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky
On our ship fantasy
All your dreams will come true
Miles away

Our voices will sing together
Until the twelfth of never
We all will live, love forever
As one

Come to see victory in a land called fantasy
Loving life a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty
As one

Come to see victory in a land called fantasy
Loving life for you and me
To be hold to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lifes has brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review

And as you stay for the play
Fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light, we'll see you through
It's your day, shining day
All your dreams come true
As you glide in your stride
With the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
I'm free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way
