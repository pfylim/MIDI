   I believe
   I believe, sometimes, I touch
   I believe love
--------------------------------------------------------
I deserve much more than this
I deserve love
--------------------------------------------------------
This is hopeless now
As the minutes stall
Sometimes I don't mind at all
Particulary the times with you
--------------------------------------------------------
   I believe
   I believe, sometimes, I touch
   I believe love
--------------------------------------------------------
This is hopeless now
As the minutes stall
Sometimes I don't mind at all
Particulary the times with you
--------------------------------------------------------
   I believe
   I believe, sometimes, I touch
   I believe love
--------------------------------------------------------
This is hopeless now
As the minutes stall
Sometimes I don't mind at all
Particulary the times with you
Particulary the times with you
Particulary the times with you
Love love
Love, it's a low down, a low down
--------------------------------------------------------
OK that's fine, as long as you believe
The only thing's moving
Don't mean a thing
Can you believe, it's getting blue
Straight through, line for line, trash
--------------------------------------------------------
Believe
Don't touch this
Believe
Don't touch this
--------------------------------------------------------
I believe (repeat)
