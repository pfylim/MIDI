          Sweet dreams            Eurythmics 


Sweet dreams are made of this ,
Who am I to disagree ?
I travel the world and the seven seas -
Everybody is looking for something .

Some of them want to use you 
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused .

Hold your head up - keep your head up - Movin' on
