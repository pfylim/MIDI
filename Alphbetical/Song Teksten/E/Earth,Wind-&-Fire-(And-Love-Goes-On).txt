Title  : AND LOVE GOES ON
Artist : EARTH, WIND AND FIRE

(Words & music: M. White/D. Foster/V. White/L. Dunn/B. Russel)

I would be so willing
To give you all I've got
You're a special lady, forget me not
I could be so tender for the likes of you
Let my heart surrender and love goes on
On and on your heart beats strong
As love goes on

Chorus:
Oh, oh, and if we can't work it out
You should know without a doubt
I will always be the one you can turn to
A friend until the end no matter where we've been
Sometimes you can't hold on
You got to give it space yeah

Everyday I'm wishing for that day to come
Feeling superstitious hoping she's the one
One day I am lonely, next with plenty smiles
Love I find amusing

Chorus:
Baby we can work it out
Yes I really love you
And without a doubt I can make you happy
Plant good memory that will last forever
