  Some dreams live on in time forever

  Those dreams you want with all your heart

  And I'll do whatever it takes

  Follow through with the promise I made

  Put it all on the line, what I hoped for at last would be mine

  
  IF I COULD REACH HIGHER

  JUST FOR A MOMENT TOUCH THE SKY

  FROM THAT ONE MOMENT IN MY LIFE

  I'M GONNA BE STRONGER

  KNOW THAT I'VE TRIED MY VERY BEST

  I'D PUT MY SPIRIT TO THE TEST, IF I COULD REACH


  Some days are meant to be remembered

  Those days we rise above the stars

  So I'll go, the distance this time

  Seeing more, the higher I climb

  That the more I believe, all the more that this dream will be mine
