10. THUNDER - EAST 17

When the thunder calls you from the mountain high
It's time to spread your wings and fly
(Spread your wings and fly)
When the thunder calls you on the purple sun
To the place where horses run.

When I saw your face
I knew you were the one
And the sky that's filled with rain raves on
I called you on the phone 
Said you'd have me on your own
When I heard your body cry for my love.

Your body's calling me
Your body's calling
I think I'm falling 
Wow...

When the thunder calls you from the mountain high
It's time to spread your wings and fly
(Spread your wings and fly)
When the thunder calls you (when it calls you) on the purple sun
To the place where horses run.

A picture in the mind
A vision in a dream
And the storm destroyed the bridge I once crossed
Have you ever felt alone?
And stood within a crowd on a path you thought you knew
But still look.

Your body's calling me    (wowow...)
Your body's calling
I think I'm falling 
Wow...

When the thunder calls you from the mountain high
It's time to spread your wings and fly
(Spread your wings and fly)
When the thunder calls you (when it calls you) on the purple sun
To the place where horses run.

I'm all confused
Like a child with choices way
So much to gain, so much to lose
Like a pain you endure, more than endure
I get somebody crazy
Every one's telling me so.

Do you feel the same?
Well, it's all I need to know.

To the place where horses run (where the horses run).
