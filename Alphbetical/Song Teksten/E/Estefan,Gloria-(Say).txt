Title  : Say
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Ain't much for promises
But I'm a fool for your sweet caress
Don't mean to be obsessed
But all that I can do is guess

And when I miss you
I try to keep my head
But when I kiss you
My heart speaks out instead

And if it's someone else
I'd rather be just by myself
Your honesty would help you
Right now it seems so hard to tell
Don't wanna worry, but it's our love alive
I'm in a hurry, my feelings I can't hide

Chorus:
Say do you say, won't you say you love me
Say do you say, that you need me still
Say won't you say that we'll stay together
Say we always will

Faithfully yours my love is real babe
If that is what you want
Then I'll be there
'Cause I feel so sure this is the real thing
My heart with you will stay

Chorus
