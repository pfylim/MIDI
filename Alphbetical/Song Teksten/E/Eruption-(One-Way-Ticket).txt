Title  : ONE WAY TICKET

(Words & music: Hunter/Keller)

One way ticket (6x)
One way ticket to the blues

Chorus:
Choo-choo train
A-chugging down the track
Gotta travel on, never coming back
Woo-ooh, gotta one way ticket to the blues

Bye bye love, my baby's leaving me
Now lonely teardrops are all that I can see
Woo-ooh, gotta one way ticket to the blues

I'm gonna take a trip to Lonesome Town
Gonna stay at Heartbreak Hotel
A fool such as I then ever was
I cry a tear so well

Chorus: ...

Took it on too long
Got a one way ticket to the blues

I'm gonna take a trip to Lonesome Town
Gonna stay at Heartbreak Hotel
A fool such as I then ever was
I cry a tear so well

One way ticket (6x)
One way ticket to the blues

Chorus: ...

Got my ticket
One way, one way, one way
Gotta one way ticket
One way, one way, one way
Oh, oh, oh, my love

One way ticket (6x)
One way ticket to the blues
