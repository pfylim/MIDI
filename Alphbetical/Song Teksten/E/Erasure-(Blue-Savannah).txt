BLUE SAVANNAH - ERASURE



Blue savannah song
Oh blue savannah song
Somewhere 'cross the desert
Sometime in the early hours
In a restless world
On the open highway

My home is where the heart is
Sweet to surrender
To you only
I send my love to you

Blue savannah song
Oh-oh-oh blue savannah song
Racing 'cross the desert
At a hundred miles an hour
To the orange side
Through the clouds and thunder

I'm on my way back
And your love will bring me home
Say that your loving will
bring me home
I'm travelling fast
And your love will bring me home
Your loving will bring me home
Will I discover
That your love will bring me home
Keep me waiting darling
Will I discover
That your love will
Bring me home yeah

My home is where the heart is
Sweet to surrender
To you only(sweet tosurrender)
I send my love to you
Oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh oh
savannah song
(Sweet to surrender)
To you only
I send my love to you

Ah ah oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
savannah song
(Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
To you only
To you only
