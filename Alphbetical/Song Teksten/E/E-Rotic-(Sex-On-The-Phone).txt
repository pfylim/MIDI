Sex on the phone I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone I need it so
Ok, I do what you say
C'mon, just let me fly, just let me cry
Just let me come, I'm gettin' high

Baby, baby number one and we'll have a lot of fun
Baby, baby number two and I'll tell you what to do
Baby, baby nnumber three feel my hands up on your knee
Baby, baby just relax next we'll give you time for sex

Sex on the phone I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone I need it so
Ok, I do what you say
c'mon, and cool
Sex on the phone so I can see
Your sex on the phone it's really real
Your touch I want it so much
I want sex on the phone
Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come, make me high

Baby baby number four
Put you flat up on the floor
Baby baby number five make your dreams come alive
Baby baby number six and I know you know the tricks
Don't want you to play perplex
Just enjoy the fun from sex.

Sex on the phone I'm so alone
Some sex on the phone I need it so
Ok, I do what you say
c'mon, and cool
Sex on the phone so I can see
Your sex on the phone it's really real
Your touch I want it so much
I want sex on the phone
Just make me fly
Just make me cry
Just make me come, make me high
