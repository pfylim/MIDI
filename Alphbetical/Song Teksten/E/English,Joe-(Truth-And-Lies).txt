Between truth and lies, there's a narrow bed

So I lay down to listen to what is being said

I hear tax is foundation on which a free government is run

I hear theory get shot down by a mercenary gun


So I stumble down Broadway past what looks like a dying man

And I'm wearing my blinders in the sometime city of the damned

You can lead a horse to the water, but you can't make it drink

And you can drag a man into the belly of the beast but you still can't

make him think
R E F R E I N :

Everybody say TRUTH and LIES, YOURS and MINE

Fallin in and out of the cracks between space (SPACE)and time(SPACE&TIME)

WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN TRUTH & LIES

TSP

I hear pinstripes on pirates are making all the fashin news

Here today, gone tomorrow,black monday got you singin the blues

Short SIGHTED and best divided,look who's makin the rules

What  ever happened to the constitution,do they teach you how to read

on a ship of fools

REFREIN

LOOKIN FOR SIGNS OF CHANGING TIMES, there's no writing on the wall

delivering at all, spend a lifetime sittin on a fence (SPEND A LIFETIME)

YOU GOTTA GET OFF YOU BACK AND DRAW THE LINE,between the truth and lies

TSP

Flip station to station, from the gospel to midnite blue

Dialling dollars for Jesus in the broadcast coming through

Do you MEASURE A MAN by the money that a woman makes

I hear Jessica's smiling while the Church Boys pray


TRUTH AND LIES, evrybody say YOURS and MINE enz.

TRUTH AND LIES , YOURS and mine ...........
