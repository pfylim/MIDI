LEARN TO BE STILL
Don Henley & Stan Lynch

Eagles
Hell Freezes Over
1994

There is a capo on 2nd fret on all guitars,
and the tab of the intro and solo reflects this tuning.

	Chords (4 means capoed open string)
        C#m7  x46454
        G#m7  464444
 
   INTRO:

   E	A
   E	A
   E	A
   B	B

   The acoustic guitars play the first E-A, then an electric comes in
   and plays the same chords, then another electric comes in and plays
   the following intro riff:

e:------------|           
B:-----------0|
G:---------2--|
D:---4---2----|
A:-2----------|
E:------------|


Sometimes the electric plays this:

      
e:---------------|
B:----0h2------0-|
G:-2---------2---|
D:---------2-----|
A:---------------|
E:---------------|

Then the verse starts.  The progression over the verse is as follows:

VERSE 1:
[E] Just another day in pa[A]radise
[C#m7] As you stumble to your be[B]d.
[E] You'd give anything to silence[A]
[C#m7] Those voices ringin' in your [B]head.

[C#m7] You thought you could find happi[A]ness
[C#m7] Just over that green [A]hill.
[C#m7] You thought you would be [G#m7]satisfied,
[A] But you never w[B]ill...learn to be sti[E]ll.

	E	A	E	A

VERSE 2:
We are like sheep without a shepherd
Who don't know how to be alone.
So we wander 'round this desert
Wind up following the wrong Gods home.

But the flock cries out for another,
And we keep answering that bell.
One more starry-eyed Messiah
Meets a violent farewell...learn to be still

	E	A	E	A
	E	A	E	A

BRIDGE:
[B] Now the flowers in your garden
[A] They don't smell so sweet so sweet
[B] Maybe you've forgotten [C#m7] the Heaven lyin' at your [B]feet.  yeah yeah yeah


Then the solo comes in, and it looks something like this.  I think it is with a slide.
The chords over the solo are E for 2 measures, A for 2 measures.
This is done twice during the solo.


e:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
B:-----------9/11\9----------------------------------------------------------|
G:-----------9/11\9-----------------2/4\2----------------------------4h6--4--|
D:----7-9-11----------------4h6p4---2/4\2-2----------------6h9--9-6---------6|
A:7-9------------------2-2--------4---------4--2h4----7-7--------------------|
E:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|


e:----------------------------|
B:----------------------------|
G:------9/11-9----------------|
D:-4-----------7-9/11-9-------|
A:---7------------------11-9-7|
E:----------------------------|


Then back to the verse

VERSE 3:
There are so many contradictions
In all these messages we send. (we keep askin')
How do I get outta here?
Where do I fit in?

And though the world is torn and shakin',
Even if my heart is breakin',
It's waiting for you to awaken
And someday you will...learn to be still.

OUTRO:
	E	A	E	A
	E	A	E	A

Keep on runnin'
Just keep on runnin'
Yeah.</PRE></BODY></HTML>
