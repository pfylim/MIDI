Title  : HOLD ON TIGHT
Artist : E.L.O.

(Words & music: Jeff Lynne)

Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see your ship go sailing
When you feel your heart is breaking
Hold on thight to your dream

It's a long time to be gone
Time just rolls no and on
When you need a shoulder to cry on
When you get so sick of trying
Just hold on tight to your dream

Chorus:
When you get so down that you can't get up
And you want so much, but you're all out of luck
When you're so downhearted and misunderstood
Just over and over and over you could

Accroches-toi a ton reve
Accroches-toi a ton reve
Quand tu vois ton bateau partir
Quand tu sens ton couer se briser
Accroches-toi a ton reve

Chorus: ...

Hold on tight to your dream
Hold on tight to your dream
When you see the shadows falling
When you hear that cold wind calling
Hold on tight to your dream
