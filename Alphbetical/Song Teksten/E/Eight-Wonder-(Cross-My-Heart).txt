CROSS MY HEART - EIGHT WONDER


Cross my heart
Hypnotised,
   with just one look at you
I'm paralyzed
I can't explain
   why just one touch from you
Drives me insane
You've got me head over heels
You better believe it
Baby and I know how it feels

Cross my heart, hope to die
May lightning strike me
   if I'm telling a lie
Cross me heart I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more
   than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true

Heavenly when something happens
   when you're
Next to me
I get chills
You can ask me anything
   and baby I will
You've got me out of control
You better believe it
Baby from my head to my toes

You're my Valentine
   every month of the year
Baby rain or shine
   I'm so happy when you're here
I want you all the time
Am I making myself clear
My love's gonna last forever
Cross my heart, cross my heart
I've never loved anyone
   more than I'm loving you

Cross my heart I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone
   more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true
 true
I've never loved anyone
   more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true
