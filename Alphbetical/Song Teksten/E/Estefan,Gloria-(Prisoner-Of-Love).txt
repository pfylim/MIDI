Title  : Prisoner Of Love
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Gotta run away from you
If I wanna save myself
And there's nothing I can do
To break your magic spell
Oh, you are evil
You show it with your eyes
Oh, and the way your body moves
Just keeps me hypnotized

'Cause I'm a prisoner of love
Somebody rescue me
Release me from this state of mind
I was born to be free
Just a prisoner of love
C'mon let me be
'Cause if loving you is my crime
Go on and close the door on me

Oh, I've been convicted
For the crime that has been done
But if losing you is my sentence
I'd rather lose my life
Can someone help me
Help me keep my sanity
'Cause I love this evil force
That's taking over me
