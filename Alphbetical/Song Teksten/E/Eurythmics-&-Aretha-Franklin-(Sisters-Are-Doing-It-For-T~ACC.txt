EURYTHMICS & ARETHA FRANKLIN - SISTERS ARE DOIN' IT FOR THEMSELVES

Now there was a time when they used to say
That behind every Great Man
There had to be a Great Woman
But in these times of change you know
That it's no longer true
So we're coming out of the kitchen
'Cause there's something we forgot to say to you 
(We say)

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Now this is a song to celebrate
The conscious liberation of the demale state
Mothers, daughters and their daughters too
Woman to woman
We're singing with you
The Inferior sex got a new exterior
We got doctors, lawyers, politicians too
Everybody take a look around
Can you see, can you see, can you see
There's a woman right next to you

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves

Now we ain't making stories
And we ain't laying plans
'Cause a man still loves a woman
And a woman still lovers a man
(Just the same through)

Sisters are doin' it for themselves
Standin' on their own two feet
And ringing on their own bells
Sisters are doin' it for themselves
