Singer : BELLE EPOQUE 
Title  : MISS BROADWAY

(Words & music: E. Lenton/A. Weyman)

Well I'm gonna get a job 'cause I need the bread
But somehow I know it's gonna affect my head
Wanna by fine dresses and a fancy car
So I better go out looking for my lucky star

Money buys, money buys

Hey Miss Broadway you're walking up and down
You got caught in the nest by the underground
For fame and fortune you gave your body away
And you were forced into action the next day
Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway
Hey, Miss Broadway

Money buys, money buys

Buy your ticket for a square yard in the sun
Buy your right of living far from a gun
Watch out 'cause if you make a wrong deal
You'll see how it feels
You may miss out on your next meal

Money buys, money buys

Aha, I like it (10x)

The gambler won't get out before he's lost it all
The junky always knows where to call
Hey, Miss Broadway is your lover's money clean
You know what I mean
Where is his connection with the underground scene

So, so, so
Money buys, money buys

Hey Miss Broadway
Hey Miss Broadway
Hey Miss Broadway
