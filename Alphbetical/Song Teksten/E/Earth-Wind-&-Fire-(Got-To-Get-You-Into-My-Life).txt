Title  : GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE 
 
(Words & music: John Lennon/Paul McCartney) 
 
Got to get you into my life, into my life (5x) 
 
I was alone, I took a ride 
I didn't know what I would find there 
Another road where maybe I could 
See another sight there 
Ooh, and then I suddenly see you 
Ooh, and then I tell you I need you 
Ev'ry single day of my life 
 
Chorus: 
Got to get you into my life (5x) 
 
You didn't run, you didn't lie 
You knew I wanna hold you 
And had you gone you knew in time 
We'd meet again for I'd have told you 
Ooh, you were meant to be near me 
Ooh, and I want you to hear me 
Say we'll be together ev'ry day 
 
Chorus: ... 
 
What can I do, what can I be 
When I'm with you I want to stay there 
If I'm true I'll never leave and 
If I do I know the way there 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you 
Ooh, didn't tell you I need you 
Ev'ry single day of my life 
 
Chorus: ...
