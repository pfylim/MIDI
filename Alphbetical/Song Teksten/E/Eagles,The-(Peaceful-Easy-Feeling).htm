Intro:  |: E - Esus4 :|

[E]I like the wa[A]y sparklin' [E]earrings [A]lay
[E]  against your [A]skin so br[B]own.
[E]  And I want to [A]sleep with you in the [E]desert tonig[A]ht
[E]  with a billion [A]stars all arou[B]nd.

Chorus

'Cause I got a [A]peaceful, easy [E]feeling
[A]and I know you won't let me d[B]own 
'cause I'm [E]al[F#m]ready [A]standing 
[B7]on  the [E]ground.

Interlude: Esus4   E    Esus4   E

I found out a long time ago
what a woman can do to your soul.
Ah, but she can't take you any way
you don't already know how to go.

Chorus

Instrumental verse

I got this feeling I may know you
As a lover and a friend.
But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear
tells me I may never see you again.
