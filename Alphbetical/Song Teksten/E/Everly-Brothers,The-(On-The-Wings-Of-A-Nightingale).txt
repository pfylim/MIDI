             On the wings of a Nightingale


When I love i get the feeling like I'm travelin'
through the sky on the wings of a nightingale
as I ride my head is spinnin' but I don't even
wonder why on the wings of a nightingale I fly

High above land and see I'll be thinkin' of you and me
couldn't find a better place to be

Oh I can feel something happening
oh I can feel something happening
oh I can feel something happening to me

So hold my hand I got this feeling that the journey
has just begun on the wings of a nightingale
and if you kike we fly together to the land of
the purple sun on the wings of a nightingale I fly

High above.........

Oh I can feel......

When I love I get a feeling like I'm travelin'
through the sky
on the wings of a nightingale
on the wings of a nightingale
on the wings of a nightingale I fly
on the wings of a nigh-tin-gale
