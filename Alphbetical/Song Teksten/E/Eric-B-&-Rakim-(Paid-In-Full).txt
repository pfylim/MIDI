ERIC B. & RAKIM - PAID IN FULL

This is a journey into sound
This is a journey into sound
A journey which along the way will bring to you
New color new dimensions new values
When all is ready I throw this switch

Pump up the volume
Pump up the volume
(Pump that bass)

You make me feel so squalid
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you
A special news bulletin from our
On the spot passport
Oh my God the music just turns me on

Thinking of a master plan
Def with the record
Def with the record
Thinking of a master plan
Def with the record
Def with the record

Thinking of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothing but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket all my money's spent
So I dig deeper but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission leave my residence
Thinking how could I get some def presidents
I need money I used to be a stick up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did

(1, 2, 3, 4)

I used to roll up this is a hold up
Ain't nothing funny stop smiling
But still don't nothing move but the money
But now I learn to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great so maybe I might just
Search for a nine to five

If I thrive then maybe I'll stay alive
So I'll walk up the street whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper a stereo a tape
Me and Eric B is my favorite dish
But without the money it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about getting paid
So I dig into the books of all the rhymes
that I've made
So now's the test to see if I've got pull
Hit the studio 'cause I'm paid in full

(1, 2, 3, 4) Maestro even long and cool

Pump up the volume
Pump up the volume
Now wait a minute you'd better talk to my mother
OK alright
Yo what happened to peace
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Def with the record
Def with the record
So fresh
Goodnight kids
