Singer : EMOTIONS
Title  : I SHOULD BE DANCING

(Words & music: M. Henderson)

Chorus:
I should be dancing, we should be romancin'
I should be prancin' in the moonlight with you

I sit home night after night
Just waiting for your call
But I never get one
I end up just tossing in my bed
And starin' at the walls
Wond'rin' what I did wrong
You say I'll be your only one
If that's true tell me why can't I see you
We go for days and days without a word
Tell me has our romance ended?

Chorus: ...

I should be dancin', love is enchanting
Let the music bring my heart together with you
Saturday night seems to be
Much lonelier than the rest
How much longer must I wait?
I really care for you, but I can't sit here
Forever, ever, ever
Come to make, take your place

Chorus: ...
