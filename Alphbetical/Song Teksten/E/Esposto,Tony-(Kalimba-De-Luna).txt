In the land of the sunshine
people don't have to groove
making emotions
believin' in what they do.

Kalimba de luna
take me tonight
show me the way
to get the right time
E A U A Unda nueva
sient' dentr'all'ossa

Kalimba de luna 2x

Kalimba du sol
please talk to me
lie is my life
believin' in what I'm sayin'

E A U A Unda nueva
sient' dentr' all'ossa
Kalimba de luna (To Fade)
