Singer : EARTH, WIND & FIRE 
Title  : SEPTEMBER

(Words & music: M. White/A. .../Willis)

Do you remember, the 21st night of september
Love was changing the minds
Pretenders while chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Chorus:
Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in september
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now december, found the love 
That we shared in september
Only blue talk and love
Remember how the true love we shared today

Chorus: ...

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in september
Ba de ya, golden dreams were shiny days
