Title  : HERE COMES THE WEEKEND

(Words & Music: Nick Lowe/Dave Edmunds)

Monday ain't no fun day
Tuesday's a blue day
Wednesday's a frenzy
Thursday's the worst day
Friday is great
'Cause I can hardly wait until the weekend
I should be clocking at eight
But I'm a little late
Can't blame my baby 'cause I took her on a date
Two to ten, and then it's friday again

Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
My working weeks so tough
I think I've had enough until the weekend
I've had an overdose of doctor's notes
But it just don't ease the pain
Going on the sick
Don't do the trick
'Cause sooner or later I'll be clocking in again
Here comes the weekend

Working like a dog more than ten hours a day
Never see enough but my take home pay
They pay me for the shift like they were giving a gift
Here comes the weekend
Some ship is coming in
Everything will go my way and I won't have to say

Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
Here comes the weekend
My working weeks so tough
I think I've had enough until the weekend
I've had an overdose of doctor's notes
But it just don't ease the pain
Going on the sick
Don't do the trick
'Cause sooner or later I'll be clocking in again
Here comes the weekend
