
7. Hold My Body Tight - EAST 17

Hold my body tight
Hold my body tight, all night
Never tell me no.

I see you over there
Baby, I would love to share
I hold you in my dreams
And then I wake up, just I dream
I'll do anything for you
Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song for birds to sing
All I ask of you yeah
Just one thing baby
Just one thing, just one thing.

Hold my body tight
Hold my body tight, all night
Never tell me no
Hold my body tight
Hold my body tight,all night
Never tell me no.

My body's all alone
Need someone to take me home
Talk untill the morning light
Don't wanna do ya
Just hold on tight
I'll do anything for you 
Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song for birds to sing
All I ask of you yeah
Just one thing baby
just one thing, just one thing.

Chorus

So come on 
And put them arms around me
Hold me real close
Like an aura surround me
I need to feel your body
The warmth of your skin
I need to know the beauty
And the secret within
And while another would be penetrating
I'll still be stimulating
Contemplating on a vision vibrating
Waiting with the key
To set your feeling free
Watcha gonna do for me
'Cause I'll do anything for you
Steal a star down from the sky
Write a song for birds to sing
All I ask of you yeah
Just one thing baby
Just one thing, just one thing.

Chorus (2x)
