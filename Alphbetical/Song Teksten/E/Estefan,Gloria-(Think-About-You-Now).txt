Title  : Think About You Now
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Is it worth the time
To bring back a forgotten rhyme
Our paths have changed but I can see
You'll always be a part of me
How can I pretend
That this affair has reached the end
When every day I see your face
In everything and every place

Chorus:
And I think about you now
It won't be long before I'll be with you somehow
And I've got to make you see
That no one else could have the same effect on me
And make me feel the I do
And I think about you now

We could try again and share the dreams we had back then
The memories are fresh and clear
My love for won't disappear

Chorus
