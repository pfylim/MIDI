Title  : AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE

(Words & music: D. Foster/J. Graydon/B. Champlin)

For a while, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew in our eyes, were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true

For a while, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last every night
Something right would invite us
To begin the dance

Chorus:
But something happened along the way
What use to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
Oh, after the love has gone
What use to be right was wrong
Can love that's lost be found

For a while to love each other with all
We would ever need love was strong, for so long
Never knew that what was wrong, oh baby
Wasn't right, we tried to find what we'd had
But sadnes was all we shared we were scared
Where this affair would lead our love into

Chorus: ...
