
11. Stay Another Day - East 17

Chorus
(Stay now) Baby if you've got to go away
Don't think I can take the pain
Won't you stay another day (stay now stay now)
Oh don't leave me alone like this
Don't you say it's the final kiss (stay now stay now)
Won't you stay another day (stay now stay now)

Don't you know we've come too far now
Just to go and try to throw it all away
Thought I heard you say you love me
That your love was gonna be here to stay
I've only just begun to know you
All I can say is won't you stay just one more day

Chorus
I touch your face while yuo are sleeping
And hold your hand
Don't understand what's going on
Good times we had return to haunt me
Though it's for you all that I do seems to be wrong
(Chorus x 3)
