Title  : Falling In Love (Uh-Oh)
Singer : Gloria Estefan


Two of hearts, lace and satin
Something in the air
Feel like another crook
That's been captured by your stare
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
And I don't wanna, no no no
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling, falling

Jealous feelings reappearing
Such a wicked dare
I'm just so damn confused
And I wonder do you care

Like walkin' in the park
Or dancin' in the dark
Just wanna hold you
Throughout the night

Prince of fire, sweet desire
With your devil-may-care
Release me from your spell
I don't want this, love ain't fair

I'm fallin' in love again

Uh-oh, uh-oh
Fallin' in love
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling, falling
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love, falling in love again
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Falling in love, falling in love again
