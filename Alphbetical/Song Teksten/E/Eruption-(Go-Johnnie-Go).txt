He was a lonely boy from nowhere's land
Trying to find a place to lay his head
For he knew for sure that no one cared
So he tried his best now everywhere

Go Johnnie, go Johnnie, go Johnnie go
Go Johnnie, go Johnnie, go Johnnie go, go, go.

Oh, he was a lonely boy from nowhere's land,...

Listen John B., you are so young
There is a place, somewhere over yonder
Where you can go, to see some wonders
Where even birds donm't need to fly

Keep on walking, come to eleven
Won't belong, before you reach heaven

Keep on walking...
Keep on walking...
Keep on walking...

Go Johnnie, go Johnnie, go Johnnie go
Go Johnnie, go Johnnie, go Johnnie go, go, go.

Oh, he was a lonely boy from nowhere's land,

Listen John B., you are so young,...

Keep on walkin', come to eleven
Won't belong, before you reach your heaven
Keep on walking...
