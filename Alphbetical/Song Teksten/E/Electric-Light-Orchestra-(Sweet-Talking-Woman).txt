Title  : SWEET TALKING WOMAN

(Words & music: Jeff Lynne)

I was searchin' on a one way street
I was hopin' for a chance to meet
I was waitin' for the operator on the line

Chorus:
(She's gone so long)
What can I do?
(Where could she be?)
Don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you
(You gotta) slow down, sweet talkin' woman
You got me runnin', you got me searchin'
Hold on, sweet talkin' lover
It's so sad if that's the way it's over

I was walkin' many days go by
I was thinkin' 'bout the lonely nights
Communication breakdown all around me

Chorus: ...

I was livin' on a deadend street
I've been askin' everybody I meet
Insufficient data coming through

Chorus: ...
