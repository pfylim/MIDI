Title  : The King & Queen Of America
Singer : Eurythmics


Well c'mon dahlin'
The stars are burning bright
C'mon now dahlin'
Our luck is good tonight
'Cause we're the all time winners
And here we go again

The King & queen of America...

Yea it's the king of nothing
And the queen of rage
With a pile of confusion
Upon a glittering stage
You know we never did anything
To make ourselves feel proud
You know we never did anything
So let's play it loud
Let's hear it for the

King & queen of America

So c'mon dahlin'
There's a big moon in the sky
We're gonna build
A little satellite
We're gonna make it fly
We're gonna send it up to heaven
All the way up to the stars
And all of them aliens
Are gonna find out
Who we are
We're talkie' 'bout the

King & queen of America


Words & Music : Stewart, Lennox
