SHEENA EASTON - THE LOVER IN ME

Talking about the love you're missing
May be then it's true when
They say love is blind
I can help you if you listen
I can make you feel good
If you just let me try
If everlasting love is what
you're waiting for
Then that time for you just has arrived
So here I am come walk right thru my door
And be loved for the rest of your life

Refrain:
If you talk about good loving
Let's talk about the lover in me (Shoo do op)
So don't go talk about no other
Just talk about the lover in me (Shoo do op)
I can give you all the loving there to receive
I can be your only woman
You're all that I need
I'll be your everything I can give you so much more
And I'll never leave you lonely at night
So here I am come walk right through my door
And be loved for the rest of your life
