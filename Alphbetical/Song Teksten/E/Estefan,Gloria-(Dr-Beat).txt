Emergency, paging Dr.Beat, emergency

Doctor, I got this feeling
Deep inside of me, deep inside of me
I just can't control my feet
When I hear the beat, when I hear the beat
Hey doctor, could ya give me something
To ease the pain, to ease the pain
'Cause if you don't help me soon
Gonna lose my brain, gonna goin' sane

I just don't know, don't know
How I'm deal with you
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr.Beat

I just don't know, don't know
Won't you help me Dr.Beat
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr.Beat
Won't you help me Dr.Beat
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr.Beat
Won't you help me Dr.Beat
Doc, doc, doc, doc, Dr.Beat
Won't help me Dr.Beat

Say say say doctor
I got this fever
That I can't control, that I can't control
Music makes me move my body
Makes me move soul, makes me move my soul
Doctor, you've got to give me something
'Cause I'm burning up, yes I'm burning up
doc, you've got to me find a cure
Or we're gonna die, yes we're gonna die

Well if ya just can't stop your feet
Pay a little visit to Dr.Beat
