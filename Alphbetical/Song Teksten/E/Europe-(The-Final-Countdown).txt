                        
              The final countdown              Europe

 
We're leavin' together, but still it's farewell
and maybe we'll come back to Earth, who can tell?
I guess there is no one to blame we're leavin' ground
(leavin' ground) will things ever be the same again?

It's the final countdown, the final countdown.

Oh-oh, we're headin' for Venus, and still we stand tall
'cause maybe they've seen us, and welcome us all, yeah
with so many light years to go, and things to be found
(to be found) how soon that we all get there so

It's the final countdown, the final countdown
the final countdown (final countdown), oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
the final countdown, oh-oh.

It's the final countdown, the final countdown
the final countdown (final countdown) oh
it's the final countdown, we're leavin' together.
