Title  : I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN

(Words & music: B. Bryant/A. Peebles/B. Miller)

Chorus:
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringin' back sweet memories
Hey window pane
Do you remember
How sweet it used to be

When we were together
Everything was so grant
Now that we've parted
There's just one sound
That I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringin' back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
'Cause he's not here with me

Wee-empty pillow
Where his head used to lay
I know you got
Some sweet memories
But like the window
You ain't got nothing to say

I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Bringin' back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Just keeps on hauntin' me
