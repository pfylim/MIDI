THE LAST RESORT
Don Henley & Glenn Frey

Eagles
Hotel California
1976

This is one of my all-time favorite Eagles songs.  I love to play it on the
piano, but since I can't very well write out the piano music I'll do guitar
instead.  Have fun with it and <A HREF="mailto:des24@cornell.edu">e-mail me</A> with any questions you may have.

The piano plays lots of this song, so if you see a chord in parenthesis,
like (E), it means the acoustic does not play there.  When the chord appears normally,
like E, that means the acoustic is playing.  [If you see C(addD), that's a chord name,
not something in parenthesis].

(E)		(A)	    (B)		       (E)
   She came from Providence,   the one in Rhode Island
		   (A)		(B)	       (E)
Where the Old World shadows hang   heavy in the air
	      (A)	       (B)	    (E)
She packed her hopes and dreams   like a refugee
	   (A)	       (B)	    (E)       (Esus4)
Just as her father came   across the sea

[guitar in]

E	     A		  B	      E
  She heard about a place; people were smilin'
		A	     B		     E
Spoke about the Red man's way and how they loved the land
	       A	 B		 E
They came from everywhere to the Great Divide
	  A		B	       E	Esus4
Seeking a place to stand or a place to hide

E	      A		   B	        E
  Down in the crowded bars, out for a good time
	      A		  B		     E
Can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there
	       A	  B	      E
They called it paradise; I don't know why
		  A	       B		   E	  Esus4
Somebody laid the mountains low while the town got high

E		      A		     B		  E
  And then the chilly winds blew down across the desert
		    A		B	    E
Through the canyons of the coast to the Malibu
		 A	     B		  E
Where the pretty people play; hungry for power
	       A	B			E	Esus4
To light their neon ways and give 'em things to do

E			 A		B	  E
  Some rich man came and raped the land; nobody caught him
		 A	     B				   E
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus, people bought 'em
	       A	B	      E
They called it paradise; the place to be
		 A       B		   E    Esus4
They watched the hazy sun sinkin' in the sea

    You can leave it all behind,   and sail to Lahaina
		       (C)    (D)	       (G)
Just like the missionaries did   so many years ago
		     (C)      (D)	  (G)
They even brought a neon sign:   Jesus is comin'
		       (C)	    (D)			      (G)
Brought the white man's burden down;   brought the white man's reign

G			C	    D		       G
  Who will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine
			C	     D		     G
"Cause there is no more new frontier; we have got to make it here
	       C	     D		    G
We satisfy our endless needs, and justify our bloody deeds
	       C       D		     G	  Gsus4
In the name of destiny, and in the name of God

G	      C		    D		 G
  And you can see them there on Sunday morning
		  C	    D		         G
They stand up and sing about what it's like up there
	       C		   G
They called it paradise; I don't know why
		   C	    D		 G       Gsus4	
You call someplace paradise; kiss it goodbye
