         Here comes the rain again ( Eurythmics )


Here comes the rain again , falling on my head like a memory ,
Falling on my head like a new emotion.
I want to walk in the open wind , I want to talk like lovers do ,
Want to dive into your ocean - is it raining with you ?

Refr. So baby talk to me like lovers do ,
      Walk with me like lovers do ,
      Talk to me like lovers do.

Here comes the rain again , raining in my head like a tragedy ,
Tearing me apart like a new emotion.
I want to breath in the open wind , I want to kiss like lovers do,
Want to dive into your ocean - is it raining with you ?

Refr. So baby ...

So baby talk to me like lovers do . The rain comes again .
Here comes the rain again , falling on my head like a memory ,
Falling on my head like a new emotion.
