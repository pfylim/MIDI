       Hotel California        Eagles


On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night.

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I wa thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say:

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely face)
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of years, you can find it there.

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat,
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget.

So I called up to the captain: "Please bring me my wine"
He said:"We haven't had spirit here since 1969"
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say:

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely face)
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring you alibis.

Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink campagne on ice
And she said:"We are all just prisoners here,
Of our own device" and the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast.
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
"Relax"said the night man."We are programmed to receive.
you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."
