Title  : MISS YOU NIGHTS

I've had many times
I can tell you
Times when innocence I'd trade for company
And children, saw me crying
I thought I had my share of that
But these miss you nights, are the longest

Midnight diamonds, stud my heaven
Southward burning me the jewels
That eye your place and warms winds
That embrace me
Just as surely kissed your face
Yet these miss you nights, are the longest

(How I missed you)
How I missed you
I'm not likely to tell
I'm a man and cold daylights by the pride
I'd rather sell
All my secrets are a wasted affair
You know them well, thinking of my going
How to cut the thread and leave it all behind
Looking windward for my compass
I take each day as it arrives
But these miss you nights, are the longest

(Lay down)
Lay down all thoughts of your surrender
It's only me whose filling time
(Lay down)
Lay down all dreams and themes once remembers
It's just the same, this miss you game
Yet these miss you nights are the longest
