Under my thumb's the girl who once had me down.
Under my thumb's the girl who once pushed me around.
It's down to me.
The diff'rence in the clothes she wears.
It's down to me the change has come.
She's under my thumb.
Under my thumb's a siamese cat of a girl.
Under my thumb she's the sweetest pet in the world.
It's down to me.
The way she does just what she's told.
It's down to me.
The change has come.
She's under my thumb.
Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself.
Under my thumb well I I can still look at someone else.
It's down to me.
The way she talks when she's spoken to.
It's down to me.
The change has come.
She's under my thumb.
