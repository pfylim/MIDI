Title  : Don't Know Much
Singer : Linda Ronstadt & Aaron Neville


Look at this face
I know the years are showin'
Look at this face
I still don't know where it's goin'

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

Look at these eyes
They've never seen what mattered
Look at these dreams
So beaten and so battered

I don't know much
But I know I love you
And that may be
All I need to know

So many questions
Still left unanswered
So much I've never through
But, when I feel you near me
sometimes I see so clearly
The only truth I've ever known is me and you

I don't know much
but I know I love you
And that may be
All there is to know

Look at this man
So blessed with inspiration
but look at this soul
Still searchin' for salvation
