Title  : MY LOVE

My love, until you came into my life one day
My love, you gave me more that ever I can say
And then, I felt something went wrong
Oh how I needed you when you went away
Good times that we used to have are just dreams
Of today

I could see, how you tried to forget me
I couldn't feel, you were trying to leave me
Hanging on, to a dream won't release me
Please don't try to live behind a smiling face
Try to love and try to live in my sweet embrace

My love you know somehow I can't believe we're through
My love someday you know you're gonna make me blue
I know there'll be no more goodbyes
Oh how it hurts me so to let, to let you go
For a while I dreamed of love that could last, this I know

I could see, how you tried to forget me
I couldn't feel, you were trying to leave me
Hanging on, to a dream won't release me
Please don't try to live behind a smiling face
Try to love and try to live in my sweet embrace
