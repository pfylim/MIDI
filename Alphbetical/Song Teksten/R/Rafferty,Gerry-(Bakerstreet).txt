Title  : BAKER STREET

(Words & music: Gerry Rafferty)

Winding your way down to Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away
And forget about ev'rything

This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people
But it's no soul and it's taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

Chorus:
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now

Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and you'll be happy
But you're crying, you're crying now

Way down the street there's light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone
When you wake up, it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
You're going, you're going home
