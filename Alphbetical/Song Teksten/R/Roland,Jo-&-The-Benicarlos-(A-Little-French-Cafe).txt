A little French Cafe,
a quiet rendezvous 
to wile my cares away
with tender thoughts of you.
If there were just some way
to turn the hands of time 
so you would reappear
to soothe this heart of mine.
A little French Cafe,
a haunting memory.
We happened there one day,
two lonely souls were we;
a magic spell was cast 
two captive hearts did burn,
I saw it in your eyes.
Why didn't you return?
