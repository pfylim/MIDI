Title  : VIRGINIA PLAIN

(Words & music: Bryan Ferry)

Make me a deal and make it straight
All signed and sealed
I'll take it to Robert E. Lee, I'll show it
I hope and pray he don't blow it
'Cause we've been around a long time
Just trying hard to make the big time
Take me on a roller coaster
Take me for an airplane ride
Take me for a six day wonder
But don't throw my pride aside
Besides what's real and make believe
We're flying down to Rio

Chorus:
What's her name
Virginia Plain
You're so chic
Teenager rebel of the week

Flavors of the mountain stream-line
Throw me a line, I'm sinking fast
Clutching at straws can't make it
Havana sound we're trying
Hard edge the hipster jiving oh oh
Last picture shows down the drive-in
You're so sheer
Midnight blue casino floors
Dance the cha-cha through all sunrise
Opens up exclusive doors, oh wow
Just like the flamingoes look the same
So me and you
got to reach out for something new

Far beyond the pale horizon
Some place near the desert strand
Where my Studebaker takes me
That's where I'll make my stand but wait
Can't you see that Holzer man

Chorus: ...
