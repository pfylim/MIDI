CHRIS REA - ALL SUMMER LONG

All summer long
We were happy
We were warm
We didn't think of an ending
To our play

All summer long
Nights of wine
Days of song
It couldn't last
Our ageing sun had to go

I will always remember you
Watching the waves
In the wind
Beach dogs hiding from the rain
Suddenly my colors
Have turned gray
Will I ever see your face again

All winter long
I will walk
My lonely road
Waiting for you
And your return
