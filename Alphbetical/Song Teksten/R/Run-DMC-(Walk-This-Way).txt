RUN D.M.C. - WALK THIS WAY

Back stroke lover always hidin' neath the covers
Till I talked to my Daddy he say
He said: You ain't seen nothin' till you go
down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a changin' your way
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin' with her sister
And her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinger with the boys in the school and
Your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' Hey diddle diddle with your kitty in
the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care
We'd took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin' 'cause she knew
What she was doin'
Then I knew love was here to stay
When she told me to walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Just give me a kiss, like this

School girl sweetie with a classy kinda sassy
Little skirts climbin' way up the knee
There were the sweet young ladies in the
School gym locker when I noticed they were
lookin' at me
I was a high school loser never made it with a lady
Till the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter
Had a favor, so I gave her just a little kiss
Like this

See-saw swinger with the boys in the school and
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' Hey diddle diddle with your kitty in
the middle of the swing
Like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Was it me she was foolin' 'cause she knew
What she was doin'
When she told me to walk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
