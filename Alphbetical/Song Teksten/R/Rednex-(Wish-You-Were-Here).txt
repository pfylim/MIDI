
13. The Rednex - Wish You Were Here

Wish you were here
Me oh my countryman
Wish you were here
Wish you were here
Don't you know
The stove is getting colder
And I miss you like hell
And I'm feeling blue

I've got feelings for you, babe
Do you still
Feel the same
From the first time
I laid my eyes on you
I felt joy of living
I saw heaven
In your eyes
In your eyes

Chorus:....

I miss you laugh
I miss your smile
I miss everything about you
Every second's like a minute
Every minute's like a day
When you're far away

Wish you were here
The stove is getting colder baby
Wish you were here
A battlefield of love and fear

Chorus....
