Title  : THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL

Hey did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?
Hey if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her

I woke up this morning
Realized what I had done
I stood alone in the cold grey dawn
I knew I'd lost my morning sun
I lost my head and I said some things
Now come the heartaches that the morning brings
I know I'm wrong
I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

So hey did you happen to see
The most beautiful girl in the world?
And if you did was she cryin', cryin'?
Hey if you happen to see
The most beautiful girl, that walked out on me
Tell her I'm sorry
Tell her I need my baby
Oh, won't you tell her, that I love her
