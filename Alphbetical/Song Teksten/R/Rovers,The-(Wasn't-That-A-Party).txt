Title  : WASN'T THAT A PARTY
Artist : THE ROVERS

(Words & music: Tom Paxton)

Chorus:
Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been three of four six-packs
I don't know, but look at me mess I'm in
My head is like a football
I think I'm gonna die
But tell me, oh me oh my
Wasn't that a party?

Some took a grapefruit
Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tomcat
He was talkin' 'bout a hot cake
That cat was talking back
Along about then, everything went back
But wasn't that a party?

I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Couldn't down in my neighbour's tree

Chorus: ...

Billy go to Tommy
Well, they went a little far
They were sitting in my backyard
Blowing on a siren of somebody's policecar

So you see, your honor
It was all in fun
That little bity trrack meet down on Main Street
Was just to see if the cops could run
But they ran as in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
And I sure can use those thirty days
To recover form that party

Chorus: ...
