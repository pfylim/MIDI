Title  : HOLD ON TO MY LOVE

(Words & music: R. Gibb/B. Weaver)

Hold on to my love
Today you came by
To tell me you are leaving me and the same
That the love
And all that we knew had just drifted away
And I looked in your eyes
And I could not bear the pain I felt inside of my heart
To think that I am gonna be lonely again
And if ever you go
Babe I know at a glance that I don't stand a chance

Chorus:
Hold on to my love
I'm nothing and I can't get along without you
You're the light of my life
There's no living without you

You're so hard to velieve that you're going away
To make me feel so down
'Cause I know that from this moment on I won't have you around
And if ever you go, babe, I know at a glance that
I don't have a chance, so

Chorus: ...

Oh baby
Nobody has taken your place
But for you
But for me
Our love would live on for the whole world to see

Chorus: ...2x...
