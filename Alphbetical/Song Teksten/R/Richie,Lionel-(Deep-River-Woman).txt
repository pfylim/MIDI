Singer : Lionel Richie


Deep river woman
Lord I'm comin' home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waitin'
Just anticipatin' oh my love
Spend a night in L.A.
Just another chance to see you
Just another chance to see you
Just you and I...
Wanted you to know
That my playin' days are over
Cause all I do is think of you
The writin's on the wall
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waitin'
Just anticipatin' oh my love
I've been out in the world
I guess the fast life had me goin'
Now all that's changed
Finally made up my mind
'Bout the one thing I've been knowin'
You're the only girl I've ever cared for in this world
Deep river woman
Lord I'm coming home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waitin'
Just anticipatin' oh my love
Your kind of love girl is forever
Took me a long time to realize
That I've come so far to end yo goin' nowhere
Girl I need you by my side
Oh oh deep river woman
Lord I'm comin' home to you
Deep river woman
Lord I know she's waitin'
Just anticipatin' oh my love
