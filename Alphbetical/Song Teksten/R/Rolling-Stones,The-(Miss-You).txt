Singer : ROLLING STONES 
Title  : MISS YOU

(Words & music: Mick Jagger/Keith Richard)

I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been the star in all my dreams
Lord, I miss you, child

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say:
Hey, what's the matter, man? We're gonna
come around at 12:00 with some Puertorican
girls that are just dying to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine, hey,
Let's go mess and fool around, you know
Like we used to

Oooh, everybody waits so long
Oooh, baby why you wait so long
Won't you come on, come home

I've been walking Central Park, singing after
Dark people think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet, shuffling through the street
Asking people, What's the matter with you boy?
Sometimes I want to say to myself, sometimes I say
Hooooohooooo hooooohooooo hooooohooooo

I guess I'm lying to myself, it's you and no one else
Lord, I won't miss you, child
You've been blotting out of my mind, fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you baby
Lord, I miss your touch
