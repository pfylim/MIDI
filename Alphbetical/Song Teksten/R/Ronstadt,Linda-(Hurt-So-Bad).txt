Title  : HURT SO BAD

(Words & music: Randazzo/Wilding/Hart)

I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Stanging here looking at you

Well, let me tell you that it
Hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad
To see you again

Like needles and pins
People say, you've been making out okay
He's in love, don't stand in his way

Well, let me tell you that it
Hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad
If you walk away

Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before
Please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go, please don't go

Please don't go, please don't go
Hurt so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm begging you please

Ooh
Come back, it hurts so bad
Come back, it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please

Oh no no
