Title  : YOU'LL NEVER FIND ANOTHER LOVE

You'll never find, as long as you live
Someone who loves you tender like I do
You'll never find, no matter where you search
Someone who cares about you the way I do
Oh, I'm not bragging on myself baby
But I'm the one who loves you
And there's no one else
No one else

You'll never find, it'll take the end of all time
Someone to understand you like I do
You'll never find, the rhythm the rhyme
All the magic we shared, just us two
Oh, I'm not trying to make you stay baby
But I know somehow, some day, some way
You are, you gonna miss my loving
You're gonna miss my love

When it's cold outside
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love

You'll never find, another love like mine
You'll keep searching and searching
Your whole life through
Oh I don't wish you no bad luck baby
But there's no if's and but's or maybe's

You gonna miss my loving
When it's cold outside,
You're gonna miss, you're gonna miss my love
