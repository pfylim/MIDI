             Time Warp            Rocky Horror



It's astounding, time is fleeting, madness takes it's tale
But listen closely, not for very much longer, I've got to keep control
I remember, doing the Time Warp, dreaking those moments when,
The black man posessed me and the boy would be calling
Let's do the Time Warp again, let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left and then a step to the rigth
Put your hands on your lips we're bringing baby times
??
??
It really drives you  ??
Let's do the Time Warp again, let's do the Time Warp again

It's so dreamy oh fantasy free me, so you can't see me, no hot at all
In another dimension with voyoristic intenbion        
Well so bloody and I see all
With a bit of a mind flip you're into the time slip
and nothing can ever be the same
You're fixed out of sensation like you're under zip
Let's do the Time Warp again

Hell was walking down the street just ...

girls part

Let's do the Time Warp again, let's do the Time Warp again

It's just a jump to the left...

Let's do the Time Warp again, let's do the Time Warp again
