                               
                   Hello                Lionel Richie 


I've been alone with you inside my mind
and in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
hello, is it me you're looking for?

I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your smile
you're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
'cause you know just what to say and you know just what to do
and I want to tell you so much, I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
and tell you time and time again, how much I care
some times I feel my heart will overflow
ello, I've just got to let you know

'cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do
are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you
tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue
but let me start by saying, I love you

Solo
     
hello, is it me you're looking for?

`cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do
are you somewhere feeling lonely or is someone loving you
tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue
but let me start by saying, I love you
