             I was born and raised on, steel river

             I see it all like it was yesterday

             The ships and bridges they were all delivered

             From Sydney harbour to the 'sisco bay

             TSP

             I met my love down-on steel river

             We served our dreams and spent our childhood days

             In rainy streets we'd kiss a - way the shivers

             and hide from fear inside the latest craze

    Dancing to Motown, making love with a Carole King record playing

    Oh how I loved you

    Say goodbye            STEEL RIVER  -  -  -  - STEEL RIVER

             Ten thousand bombers hit the Steel River

             And many died to keep her running free

             And she survived but now she's gone forever

             Her burning heart is just a memory

             
             And I ran away from life on Steel River

             Luck or not I gladly took the break

             The odds were low the chances nearly zero

             But chance it was I had to take

             TSP

             STEEL RIVER - - - - STEEL RIVER

             They say that salmon swim in Steel River

             They say that it's good to see them back again

             I know it hurts to see what really happened

             I know one salmon ain't no good to them

             
             They were born and raised to serve their Steel Mother

             It was all they taught and all they ever knew
              
             And they believed that she would keep their children

             Even though not a single word was true

             Say goodbye,   Steel river

             Say goodbye,   oooooh

             STEEL RIVER - - -STEEL RIVER (herhalen)
