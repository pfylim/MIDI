Title  : Se La
Singer : Lionel Richie


You know sometimes I sit and wonder
Just how this world would be
If we had all the people laughing
And everybody living in harmony

Chorus:
We have to say se la, se la
Talking to the people
Se la, se la
it's time you thought about it
Se la, se la(hey hey)
Se la, se la

There would be no more living in desperation
And no more hatred and deceit
Tell me can you imagine
All the children playing
And everyone dancing in the street

Chorus
We se la, se la, se la
Do it, say it
Se la, se la
Talking to everybody (yeah)
Se la, se la
You know what it's all about
Se la, se la
You play for people (man)
Play for the people
(ad lib)

It's time you know for everyone to come together
I know it's hard but thsi dream must come to light
Because life should be one big celebration
I'm talkin' to you now
Only we can make things right

Chorus:
We se la, se la, se la
Counting on everybody (yeah)
Se la, se la
I know you  thought about it
Se la, se la
Se la, se la
We wanna say
Se la, se la(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Se la, se la
Talk about it, sing about it
Talk about it, sing about it
Talk about it, sing about it
Se la, Se la(Huh) All the children
Tell me about the children
We've got to help them now to survive
One world, one heart, is our salvation
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Let us keep the dream alive
Se se la, se la, se la
Se la, se la, se la
Se la, se la
Well...I know, I know
Se la (say it), se la (say it)
(Say it), (say it)
Se la, se la
Everybody come together

Chorus:
Se la (say it), se la (say it)
Don't hold back no longer
Se la, se la
Can't you see it, just believe it
Se la (say it), se la, ooh, ooh, ooh
Talkin' to you now
Se la, se la
Talking to you now
Se la, se la
Se la, se la
Se la, se la
Se la (save the children), se la
Se la, se la...fade...
