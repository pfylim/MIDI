         Bacardi Feeling

Come on over have some fun,
Dancing in the morning sun,
Look into the bright blue sky,
Bacardi lets your spirit fly.

Living it up this brand new day,
Summer, sun, it's time to play,
Doing things that feel so good,
Get into the motion.

Refrain

Bacardi feeling - never been so easy
Bacardi dreaming - taking it easy with Bacardi.

Just another lucky day,
Summer, sun, it's time to play,
Loving makes you feel so good,
Bacardi sets the mood.

Refrain

Bacardi feeling - never been so easy
Bacardi dreaming - taking it easy with Bacardi.
