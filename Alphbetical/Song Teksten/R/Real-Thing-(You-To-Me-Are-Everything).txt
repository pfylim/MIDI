REAL THING - YOU TO ME ARE EVERYTHING

I would take the stars out of the sky for you
Stop the rain from falling if you asked me to
I'd do anything for you, your wish is my command
I could move a mountain when your hand is in my hand

Oh words cannot express how much you mean to me
There must be some other way to make you see
If it takes my heart and soul you know I'd pay the price
Everything that I possess I'd gladly sacrifice

REFRAIN:
Oh you to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
To you I guess I'm just a clown
Who picks you up each time your down
Oh baby, oh baby

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power girl
To keep me hanging on
So now you've got the best of me
Come on and take a rest of me
Oh baby

Though you're close to me we seem so far apart
Maybe given time you'll have a change of heart
If it takes forever girl then I'm prepared to wait
The day you give your love to me won't be a day too late

REFRAIN: ...

You give me just a taste of love
To build my hopes upon
You know you've got the power girl
To keep me hanging on
So now you've got the best of me
Come on and take a rest of me
Oh baby

You to me are everything
The sweetest song that I could sing
Oh baby, oh baby
