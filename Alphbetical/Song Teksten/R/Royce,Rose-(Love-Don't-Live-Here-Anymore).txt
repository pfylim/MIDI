Title  : LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE

(Words & music: Miles Gregory)

Chorus:
You've abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When yo lived inside of me
There was nothing
I could conceive that you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

Chorus: ...

Love don't live here anymore
Just an emptiness and memories of what we had before
You went away, found another place to stay
Another home

Chorus: ...

Through the windows of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away
Don't you know I miss you so, I need your love

Chorus: ...
