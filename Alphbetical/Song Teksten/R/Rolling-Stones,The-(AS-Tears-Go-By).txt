Vers 1:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the evening of the day,
I sit and watch the children play.
Smiling faces I can see but not for me,
I sit and watch as tears go by.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
My riches can't buy everything,
I want to hear the children sing.
All I hear is the sound of rain falling on the ground,
I sit and watch as tears go by.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 3:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
It is the evening of the day,
I sit and watch the children play.
Doin' things I used to do they think are new,
I sit and watch as tears go by.
