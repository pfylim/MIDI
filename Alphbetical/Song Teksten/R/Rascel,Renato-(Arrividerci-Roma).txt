Arrividerci, Roma.
Goodbye, goodbye, to Rome.
City of a million moonlit places,
city of a million warm embraces,
where I found the one of all the faces 
far from home.

Arrividerci, Roma.
It's time for us to part.
Save the wedding bells for my returning,
Keep my lover's arm
outstretched and yearning,
please be sure the flame of love keeps
burning in her heart.
