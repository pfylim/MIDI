Title  : Fine Brown Frame
Singer : Lou Rawls & Dianne Reeves


You've got a fine brown frame
And I wonder what could be your name
You look good to me 'cause all I can see
Is your fine brown frame

Tell me how long have you been 'round?
Baby when did you hit this bag town?

Now I want to scream 'cause I've never seen
Such a fine brown frame
Now all that I have is a broken down chair
But I'd make you queen on my throne
Don't be a square why don't you come over here

Together we would be "gone"
Baby, you've got that fine brown frame
Oh baby won't you tell me your name?
You're solid with me
'Cause all I can see is that fine brown frame


Words & Music : Guadalupe Cartiero & J. Mayo Williams
