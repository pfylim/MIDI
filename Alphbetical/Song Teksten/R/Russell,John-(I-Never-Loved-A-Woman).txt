Singer : JOHN RUSSELL 
Title  : I NEVER LOVED A WOMAN

I never loved a woman the way that I love you
So don't you worry baby as long as I have you

We've been together a long long time
We never even had a fight
Always shared our sweet delight
And now you found my jealous sight

How can you give your love to another
Say it ain't true, even if it ain't true
Baby, I'll forgive you

I never loved a woman the way that I love you
So don't you worry baby as long as I have you

Promise me you'll never go
Can't you see I love you so

I never loved a woman the way that I love you
So don't you worry baby as long as I have you
