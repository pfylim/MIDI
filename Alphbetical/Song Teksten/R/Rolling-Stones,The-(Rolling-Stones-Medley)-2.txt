I can't get no Satisfaction
I can't get no Satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no - I can get no 
When I'm driving in my car 
And the man on the radio;
He's telling me more and more
About some useless information supposed to
Fire my imagination. I can get no. Oh, no, no, no. Hey, hey hey.
That's what I say.

It's the Honky Tonk Women
Gimme gimme gimme the Honky Tonk blues

Watch it!
I was born in a crossfire hurricane.
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain.
But it's all right. Now
In fact, it's a gas! But it's all right.
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash. It's a gas! Gas! Gas!

Well, I told you once and I told you twice;
But you never listen to my advice.
You don't try very hard to please me;
With what you know it should be easy.
Well, this could be the last time.
This could be the last time.
May be the last time. I don't know.
