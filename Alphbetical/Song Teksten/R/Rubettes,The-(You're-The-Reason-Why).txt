Singer : THE RUBETTES 
Title  : YOU'RE THE REASON WHY

The things you say, don't always hurt me
The things you do, don't always make me cry
The things you do, they don't always hurt me
But when they've hurt me, you're the reason why

The things you do are without reason
The things for me to do is let it lie
But when I lie the pain ain't easing
You know the reason, you're the reason why

Sometimes I'm up, sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I don't know where I'm going anyway
Sometimes I feel just like a clown
And I know just where I'm going
And I just don't know the way

The things you say, don't always hurt me
The things you do, don't always make me cry
The things you do, they don't always hurt me
But when they've hurt me, you're the reason why
