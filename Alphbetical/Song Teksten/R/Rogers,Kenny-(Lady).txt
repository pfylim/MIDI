                 LADY


Look around you, look up here
take time to make time make time to be there
Look around be a part, I feel for the winter but
don't have a cold heart.

And I love you best, you're not like the rest
you're there when I need you , you're there
when I need I'm gonna need you.

A long time ago I had a lady to love.
She made me think of things I never thought of,
now she's gone and I'm on my own but I love 
song has come into my mind, love song it was
there all the time.

Lady let me take a look at you now,
you're there on the dance floor makin'
me want you somehow
Oh lady it's only fair I should say to you:
"Don't be thinkin' that I don't want you cuz 
maybe I do"


Look around come to me
I have no answers but know where I wanna be
I look around play a part,
I was born in the winter and cooled by a warm heart,

And I love you the best, you're not like the rest...
