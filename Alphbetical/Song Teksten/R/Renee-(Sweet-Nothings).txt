Title  : SWEET NOTHINGS

(Words & music: R. Self)

Aha honey

Alright

My baby whispers in my ear
Ooh sweet nothings
He knows the things I like to hear
Ooh sweet nothings
Things he wouldn't tell nobody else
Secrets baby I keep them to myself
Sweet nothings
Ooh sweet nothings

We walk along hand in hand
Ooh sweet nothings
Yeah we both understand
Ooh sweet nothings
Certainly pass the time read my book
My baby gives me that special look
Sweet nothings
Ooh sweet nothings

I'm sitting at my front door
Ooh sweet nothings
Why do I love him, yes of course
Ooh sweet nothings
Mama turned on, my front door slammed
`Come in darling, that's enough for tonight'
Sweet nothings
Ooh sweet nothings
Sweet nothings
Ooh sweet nothings
Sweet nothings
