Love me tender, love me sweet
Never let me go
You have made my life complete
And I love you so

Chorus:
Love me tender, love me true
All my dreams fulfill
For my darlin' I love you
And I always will

Love me tender, love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part

Chorus: ...

Love me tender, love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of times

Chorus: ...

When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go

Chorus: ...
