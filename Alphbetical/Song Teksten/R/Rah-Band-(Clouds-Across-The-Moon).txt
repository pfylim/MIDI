RAH BAND - CLOUDS ACROSS THE MOON

Good evening, this is the Inter-Galactic Operator
Can I help you?

Yes I'm trying to reach flight commander P.R. Johnson
on Mars flight 247

Very well, hold on please
You're through

Thank you operator

Hi-ya darling, how you're doing?
Hey baby, were you sleeping?
Oh, I'm sorry, but I've been really missing you
Hi-ya darling, how's the weather?
Baby, is that cold better now?
Oh I'm sorry, is there someone there with you?

Oh since you went away
There's nothing going right
I just can't sleep alone at night
I'm not ashamed to say
I really need a friend
Or it's the end

Refrain:
Now when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here in the night I just hope and pray that soon
Oh baby, you'll hurry home to me
Now when I look at the clouds across the moon
Here in the night I just hope and pray that soon
Oh baby, you'll hurry home to me

Hi-ya darling, the kids say they love you
Hey baby is ev'rything fine with you?
Please forgive me, but I'm trying not to cry

Oh I've had a million different offers
on the phone but I just stay right here at home
I don't think that I can take it anymore
This crazy war

I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation
but we are experiencing violent storm conditions
in the asteroid belt at this time
We may loose this valuable beep-space communication link
Please be as brief as possible, thank you

Oh since you went away
There's nothing going right
I just can't sleep alone at night
I'm not ashamed to say
I really need a friend
Or it's the end

Hello... hello operator...

Yes...

I seem to have lost the connection
Could you please try again?

I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we have lost contact
with Mars 247 at this time

Ok... thank you very much...
I'll try again next year (next year next year)

Refrain: ...
