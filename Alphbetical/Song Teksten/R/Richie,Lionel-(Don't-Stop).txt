Title  : Don't Stop
Singer : Lionel Richie


I can feel the night time callin', hold on
I can feel my resistance fallin', hold on
Don't you know baby you've got it, this hold on me
Girl love just what you're doin', oh you're all I need
When I'm dancin' with you girl with the lights down low
The power you possess you know I can't let go
Oh listen to me
Don't stop movin' baby, tonight's the night
Don't stop groovin' baby, it'll be all right
Can't you feel the fire burnin', feels so right
Oh can't you feel my bady yearnin', holding you tight
Don't hold back the heat is risin', girl can't you see
All I need is your sweet lovin', oh to satisfy me
The way you move girl on the floor the magic's in your eyes, baby
You know you turn me on you've got me hypnotized
Oh let me tell you
Don't stop movin' baby, tonight's the night, ooh
Don't stop groovin' baby, it'll be all right, listen to me
Don't stop movin' baby, tonight's the night, oh
Don't stop groovin' baby, it'll be all right
Oh it's you for me
You're everything I want, everything I need
Oh we are the lucky ones, to feel what we feel tonight
Oh it's right
For a love that's meant together, tonight's the night
For a love that's meant forever, just hold on tight
Oh baby
Don't stop movin' baby, tonight's the night, ooh
Don't stop groovin' baby, it'll be all right, ow
Don't stop movin' baby, tonight's the night
Don't stop groovin' baby, it'll be all right
