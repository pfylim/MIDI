Title  : Tonight Will Be Alright
Singer : Lionel Richie


Little darlin'
Where you been so long
I've been out here thinking 'bout you
And the feeling's real strong
Well the time has come to celebrate
You and me girl sho' sounds great
'Cause tonight will be alright
      oh baby
Little darlin'
Come on let's take a drive
To a midnight honky tonk
And we'll set it on fire
We don't wanna be nice
Don't have to be cool
You and my girl
Let's break all the rules
'Cause tonight will be alright
  Alright baby
  I'm gonna say it again
Oh tonight
I can see us moving on down the highway
I can see us loving till our hearts desire
Anything you wanna do girl you just tell me
'Cause it's all....right
'Cause it's all....right
Little darlin'
Telling you no lie
Keep me thinking about you honey
My soul's on fire
Well if you wondering girl
What kinda games I play
Anything's alright
Anything you say
'Cause tonight will be all....right
Alright baby
Say it again
Ad lib....
