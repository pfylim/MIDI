Singer : CLIFF RICHARD 
Title  : MY KINDA LIFE

(Words & music: Chris East)

Right from early days from the moment I was born
I would take my guitar in the early mornin'
And go down in the fields and play ay ay

Sittin' down there in the long grass strummin'
I could see the people from miles around comin'
To hear me sing my music and play ay ay

Refrain:
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life yes
And I like it
Well that's been my kinda life
My kinda life yes
And I like it
Well that's been my kinda life yeah
And I wouldn't spend it anywhere
Other than sitting down somewhere
In away my days yeah

Well I made it to the city just me and my guitar
That is where I found this freaky little bar
And I sat down on the stage and played ay ayed

Well up came a guy who said it wasn't plastic
He wanted to sign away my life or something drastic
But all I wanna do is play ay ay

Refrain: ...

Well fame and fortune I've let them pass me by
No one in the country can say I didn't try
To turn the people on and play ay ay

Well, you can keep all the money and
The places that go with it
'Cause all I want is freedom
And no cash could ever get it
All I wanna do is play ay ay

Refrain: ...
