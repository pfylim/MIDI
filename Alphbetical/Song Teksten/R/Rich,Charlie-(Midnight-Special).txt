Well it's on the table knife, a fork, a pan,
if you say a thing about it you're in trouble with the man.

If you ever go to Houston,
you better walk right;
you better not stagger,
you better not fight;
Sheriff Benson will arrest you,
he'll carry you down,
and if the jury finds you guilty, 
penitentiary bound.

Yonder come little Rosie,
how in the world do you know,
I can tall her by her apron,
and the dress she wore,
umbrella on her shoulder,
piece of paper in her hand,
she goes amarching to the captain,
says I want my man.
