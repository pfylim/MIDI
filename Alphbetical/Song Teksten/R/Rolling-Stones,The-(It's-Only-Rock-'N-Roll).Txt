Singer : ROLLING STONES 
Title  : IT'S ONLY ROCK'N'ROLL

If I could stick me a pen in my heart
I'd spill it all over the stage
Would it satisfy ya or would it slide on by ya
Or would you think this boy is strange
Ain't he stra-yaya-nge

If I could win you
If I could sing you a lovesong so divine
Would it be enough for your cheatin' heart
If I broke down and cried
If I cry-i-yied

Refrain:
I said I know it's only rock'n'roll
But I like it, I said
I know it's only rock'n'roll
But I like it like it yes I do

Well I like it, oh yes, I like it
I like it, I said
Can't you see this old boy's getting lonely

If I could stick a knife in my heart
Suicide right on the stage
Would it be enough for your teenage lust
Would it help to ease the pain
Ease your brain
If I could dig down deep in my heart
Feelings would flood on the page

Would it satisfy ya
Would it slide by ya
Would you think the boy's insane
He's insa-yaya-ne

Refrain: ...

Don't you think that you're the only girl around
I bet you think that you're the only woman in town

Refrain: ...
