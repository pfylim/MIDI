  6. LISTEN TO YOUR HEART - Roxette
  
  Ooh
  I know there's something in the wake of your smile
  I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
  You built a love, but that love falls apart
  A little piece of heaven turns to dust.
  
  Listen to your heart
  When he's calling for you
  Listen to your heart
  There's nothing else you can do
  I don't know where you're going
  And I don't know why
  But listen to your heart
  Before you tell him good-bye.
  
  Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
  The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
  They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
  I feel I'm belonging to your dreams. 
  
  Listen to your heart
  When he's calling for you
  Listen to your heart
  There's nothing else you can do
  I don't know where you're going
  And I don't know why
  But listen to your heart
  Before you tell him good-bye.
  
  And there are voices that want to be heard
  So much to mention but you can't find the words 
  The scent of magic, the beauty that's been (the beauty that's been)
  When I was wilder and the wind.
  
  Listen to your heart
  Take a listen to you
  When he's calling for you
  Listen to your heart
  Take a listen to you
  There's nothing else you can do
  I don't know where you're going
  And I don't know why
  Listen to your heart
  Before, oh.
  
  Listen to your heart
  Take a listen to you
  When he's calling for you
  Listen to your heart
  Take a listen to you
  There's nothing else you can do
  I don't know where you're going
  And I don't know why
  Listen to your heart
  Before you tell him good-bye.
  
  Listen to your heart
  Listen to your heart
  Take a listen to your heart   (listen to your heart)
  Take a, take a listen (listen to your heart) to it
  Yeah
  Listen to your heart
  Listen to your heart
  Hea a a...
  Listen to your heart
  Hea a a ooh...
  Listen to your heart
  Hea a a...
