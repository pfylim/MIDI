                      The look                  Roxette 


Walking like a man , hitting like a hammer , she's a juvenile scam ,
Never was a quitter , tasty like a raindrop , she's got the look.
Heavenly bound 'cause heaven's got a number when she's spinning me around
Kissing is a colour , her loving is a wild dog , she's got the look.

Refrain 

She's got the look , she's got the look,
She's got the look , she's got the look.
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue ?
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you.
And I go la la la la la , she's got the look.


Fire in the ice , naked to the t-bone is a lover's disguise ,
Banging on her head drum , shaking like a mad bull , she's got the look
Swaying to the band , moving like a hammer , she's a miracle man,
Loving is the ocean , kissing is the west sand , she's got the look.

Refrain 

She's got the look ....

Walking like a man , hitting like a hammer , she's a juvenile scam,
Never was a quitter, tasty like a raindrop , she's got the look.
And she goes : na na na na na na na na na na ... , she's got the look.

Refrain 

She's got the look ...

What in the world can make you so blue ?
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you.
And I go : la la la la la ,
Na na na na na na na na na na na ... , she's got the look
