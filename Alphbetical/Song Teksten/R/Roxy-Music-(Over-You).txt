Title  : OVER YOU

(Words & music: Ferry/Manzanera)

Oh baby, this is nowhere
Wish I was somewhere over you
Your sweet lips tell me there's no chance
No more romance over you

Oh baby, how can I go on
Crying so long over you
Where strangers look for new love
I'm so lost in love over you

Some day yes it might come baby
When I'll be babe, over you
And always up to that moment
I will try to say I'm over you
