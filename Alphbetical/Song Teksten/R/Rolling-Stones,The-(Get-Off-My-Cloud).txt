Vers 1:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I live in an apartement on the ninety ninth floor of my block.
And I sit at home lookin' out of the window imaginin' the world
has stopped.
Then it flies a guy thats all dress'd up just like a Union Jack.
He says I've won five pounds if I have his kind of detergent pack.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I said Hey (Hey) you (you) Get off of my cloud !  ( 3*)
Don't hang around, 'couse two's a crowd on my cloud baby.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The telephone is ringin' I say Hi it's me Who's there on the line ?
A voice says, Hi hullo. How are you ? Well I guess I'm doing fine.
He says, It's three a.m. and there's to much noise. 
Don't you people ever want to go to bed ?
Just cause you feel so good, do xou have to drive me out of my head ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I said Hey...
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 3:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I was sick and tired, fed up with this and decided to take a drive
down town.
It was so very quiet and peaceful. There was nobody, not a soul
around.
I laid myself out I was so tired and started to dream.
In the mornin' the parkin' tickets were just like flags stuck on my
wind screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I said Hey...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
