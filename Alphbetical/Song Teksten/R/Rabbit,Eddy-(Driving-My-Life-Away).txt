
4. DRIVIN‹ MY LIFE AWAY - EDDY RABBIT

Where the midnight, head light,
Find you on a rainy night.
Steep ways, up ahead, throw me down, making no time.
I gotta keep rolling.
Those windshield wipers slapping out of tempo.
Keeping perfect rhythm with the song on the radio.
I gotta keep rolling. 

Chorus:
Uh, I‹m driving my life away.
Looking for a better way for me.
Uh, I‹m driving my life away.
Looking for a sunny day.

Where the truck stops, you did.
Coming on to me.
Trying to talk me into a ride.
Said, I wouldn‹t be sorry.
She was just a Baby.
Hey wait, just pour me another cup of coffee
Pop it down, jack me up, shoot me up,
Flying down the highway.
Looking for the morning.

Chorus

Where the midnight, head light,
Find you on a rainy night.
Steep ways, up ahead, throw me down, making no time.
I gotta keep rolling.
Those windshield wipers slapping out of tempo.
Keeping perfect rhythm with the song on the radio.
We gotta keep rolling. 

Chorus and fade out
