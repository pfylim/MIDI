Title  : Love Will Conquer All
Singer : Lionel Richie


Here we are
Out here me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all
Do you really want to know
Just how long love will last
Will all of the bad times past
How can we make things right
Ooh and why
Why is the world so unkind,
We surel can find peace of mind
If we only see the light, can't we see that
Here we are
Out here me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Ooh here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Lover will conquer all
Can somebody tell me why
Why do our dreams go wrong
Why can't we al belong
Ooh, where do we start
Oh and tell me when
When will we ever learn
There's nowhere else we can turn
The truth is in our hearts, herre we are together
Sometimes the road gets hard to travel
Sometimes the pains too much to bear
Sometimes when life seems to unravel
That's the time oh - to say
We're gonna make it anyway
Can't we see that
Here we are
Out here me and you
Reaching out to each other
Is all that we can do
Here we stand
Trying not to fall
There's no need to worry
Love will conquer all
(ad lib...fade)
