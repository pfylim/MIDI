Title  : High Wire
Singer : Rolling Stones


We sell 'em missiles
We sell 'em tanks
We give 'em credit
You can call up the bank
It's just a business
You can pay us in crude
You'll love these boys
Just go play out your fauds
We got no pride, don't care whose boots we lick
We act so gready, makes me sick, sick, sick

Chorus:
So get up, stand up, out of my way
I wanna talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay
I wanna talk to the men right away

We walk the high wire
Sending the men to the frontlines
Hoping they don't catch the hellfire
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights
We walk the high wire
Sending the men to the frontlines
Tell 'em to pipe in the sunshine
With hot guns and cold, cold nights
Our lives are chattered, our jobs at risk
Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist
Another Munich we just can't afford
We gonna stay in the 52nd airbome

Chorus

We walk the high wire
Putting the world on a deadline
Hoping we don't taste the hellfire
Of hot guns and cold, cold nights
We walk the high wire
Putting the world on a deadline
Catching a bite on the prime time
With hot guns and cold, cold nights
Get up, stand up (2x)
We walk the high wire
Sending the men to the frontline
And hoping that we back the right side
With hot guns and cold, cold nights
We walk the high wire
Sending the men into the frontline
And hoping they don't catch the hellfire
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold nights.
