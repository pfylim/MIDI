(I CAN'T GET NO) SATISFACTION - ROLLING STONES


I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm drivin' in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
about some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination

I can't get no
Oh no, no,no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm watching my TV
And that man comes to tell me
How white my shirts can be
Well, he can't be a man
'Cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me

I can't get no
Oh no, no,no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try

I can't get no, I can't get no
When I'm ridin' 'round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm signin' that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me baby, better come back letter next week
'Cos you see I'm on a losing streak

I can't get no
Oh no, no,no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
No satisfaction
