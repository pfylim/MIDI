Title  : THE COWARD OF THE COUNTY

(Words & music: Roger Bowling/Billy Edd Wheeler)

Everyone considered him the coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong
His momma named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow
But something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong

Chorus:
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand
You don't have to fight to be a man

He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy
Son, my life is over, but yours has just begun

Chorus: ...

There's someone for everyone and Tommy's love was Vicky
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man
One day while he was working the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Vicky, there was three of them

Tommy opened up the door and saw Vicky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture
And his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again

Chorus: ...

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked in the barroom
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor
When Tommy turned around, they say: hey look, old yellow's leaving
But you could've heard a pin drop when he stopped and locked the door

Twenty years of crawling was bottled up inside him
He didn't hold nothin' back, he let  'em have it all
When Tommy left the barroom not a Gatlin was standin'
He said, This one's for Vicky, as he watched the last one fall

I promised you, dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please, don't think I'm weak, I couldn't turn the other cheek
And papa, I sure hope you understand
Somtimes you gotta fight when you're a man
