            Faithful reasons still unknown

            Like Bleakhouse fog seems everywhere

            The truth has faded into stone

            Hope lies freezing in the midnight air

            Though dark our days may seem, this is a different dream

            Their freedom light don't shine at all   

            SO I WILL LIGHT A CANDLE FOR YOU

            KEEP IT BURNING IN THE NIGHT, AND PRAY THAT YOU'RE ALLRIGHT

            I WILL LIGHT A CANDLE  FOR YOU

            LITTLE CANDLE BURNING BRIGHT


            When schoolyard heroes disappear

            A little girl she stands alone

            Oh I believe you if you say

            A prayer can help to get her home

            
            REFREIN
