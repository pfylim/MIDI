DIANA ROSS - TOUCH BY TOUCH

I can tell by the look in your eyes
That you like what you see
I can tell by the touch of your hand
That you've got what I need

Baby there's no hurry
We've got no worries
Let's take all night
Give me sweet lovin'
Come taste my honey
Into the night

Touch by touch
Your fingers to the talking
I need to hear so much
Now we're getting closer
To what I want so much
Chemical reaction
Makes me give it up
Touch by touch
Put your arms around me
Baby wrap me up

I can tell by the woman in me
You're the man that I need
So much lovin' that comes from the heart
That you give honestly
Come take my hand
I'll show you where, where you can lead
Baby there's no hurry
We've got no problems
Make me believe

Touch by touch
Your fingers do the talking
I need to hear so much
Touch by touch
Chemical reaction
Makes me give it up
Touch by touch
Ah put your arms around me
Baby wrap me up
Touch by touch
Now we're gettin' closer
To what I want so much
Touch by touch
