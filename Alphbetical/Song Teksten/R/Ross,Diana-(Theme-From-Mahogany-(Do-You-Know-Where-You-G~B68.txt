Title  : THEME FROM MAHOGANY (DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE ...)

Do you know where you're going to
Do you know the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you know what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Sometimes while standing still in time
You think you live the thought that fill your mind
Now we've all been to Stonybrook
Just hinging out and we've all had
a look and seen what's nothing about

Do you know where you're going to
Do you know the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you know what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for, do you know?

Now what am I saying to you
What kind of prayer am I to pray for you
I can only do my best and tell you what I see
And if you've seen the rest
Please send it to me

Do you know where you're going to
Do you know the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to, do you know?
Do you know what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open doors
What are you hoping for, do you know?
