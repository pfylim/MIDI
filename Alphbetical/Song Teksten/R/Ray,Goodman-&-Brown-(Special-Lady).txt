Title  : SPECIAL LADY

(Words & music: H. Ray/A. Goodman/L. Walter)

Chorus:
You must be a special lady
And a very exciting girl
You got to be a special lady
'Cause you got me
Sittin' on the top of the world
Sittin' on the top of the world

Somehow I knew, it would be you
To change my grey skies to blue
And it was strange
When you called my name
Ever since that day I haven't been the same

Before I met you
My sun didn't want to shine
But all, all of a sudden
You snapped up from behind
Snap, hap with the reason in my mind

Chorus: ...

I was like a song
So out of key
Then you came and give my song a melody
Thanks to you
For pulling me through
I've always lost, but now I win with you
Before I've met you my sun didn't want to shine
But all, all of a sudden
You snapped up from behind
Snap, hap with the reason in my mind

Chorus: ...
