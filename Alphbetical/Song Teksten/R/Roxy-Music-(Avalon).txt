Title  : Avalon
Singer : Roxy Music


Now the party's over
I'm so tired
The I see you coming
Out of nowhere
Much communication in a motion
Without conversation or a notion

Avalon

When the samba takes you
Out of nowhere
And the background's fading
Out of focus
Yes the picture's changing
Every moment
And your destination
You don't know it

Avalon

When you bossanova
There's no holding
Would you have me dancing
Out of nowhere

Avalon...
