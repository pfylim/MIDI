Title  : I BELIEVE IN YOU

(Words & music: A. Holten/M. Manengkei)

I, I won't let you out
Let me in pretty baby
I, I won't let you down
Oh, it's a sin pretty baby

I believe in you
Since the time we're together
I believe in you
When you say that you love me
When you say you need me
A whole life through
I believe in you
Take me in to your heart
Let me in pretty baby
Into your life my love

True, truly I must say
You're the one pretty baby
True, true love's here to stay
We'll have fun pretty baby
I believe in you
From now on till forever
I believe in you
When you say that you love me
When you say you need me
A whole life through
I believe in you
I won't leave you alone
It's a sin pretty baby
It's a sin pretty baby
I can't make it alone
I can't make it alone
