DIANA ROSS - EATEN ALIVE

Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on your bed of leaves
And the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe
Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the word
And you say

That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you can digest what I can see
The taste-of you can be

REFRAIN 1:
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive, to be
Eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

Now I got you on the run
And the quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times
With a little stimulation
I'll come once more, and you say

REFRAIN 1: ...

REFRAIN 2:
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive, to be
Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

REFRAIN 1: ...
