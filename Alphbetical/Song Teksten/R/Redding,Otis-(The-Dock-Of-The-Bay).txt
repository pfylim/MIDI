THE DOCK OF THE BAY - Otis Redding

Sittin' in the morning sun
I'll be sitting when the evening comes
Watchin' the ships roll in 
Then I watch'em roll away again, yeah
Sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

I left my home in Georgia
Headed for the Frisco Bay
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothing's gonna come my way
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay
Wasting time

Looks like nothing's gonna change
Ev'rything still remain the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same

Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roam
Just to make this dock my home
Now I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wasting time
