Oh get away, and don't come back
who do you think you're fooling
with lies like that ?
You have dreams that set the rain on fire
burning with a cheap desire
and it's plain as grey, that what you say
have meanings of theit own.
My love, my love, she don't need diamonds
my love, my love, she don't need diamonds.

My woman is a sweet dream
and she don't need diamonds.
she takes her hip to the tambourine
and she don't need diamonds.
If you can't love me for nothing
then you can't love me at all.

And it's plain as grey.
That what you say, have meanings of their own.
We all, got to dance and
take a chance ?
But babe, you should have stayed at home
my love, my love, she don't need diamonds.
My love, my love, she don't need diamonds.

She don't need diamonds,...
