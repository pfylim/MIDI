  11. RUBY, DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE TO TOWN - KENNY ROGERS
  
  You've painted up your lips
  And rolled and curled your tinted hair
  Ruby, are you contemplating
  Going out somewhere?
  The shadow on the wall
  Tells me the sun is going down
  Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.
  
  It wasn't me that started
  That old crazy Asian war
  But I was proud to go
  And do my patriotic chore
  And yes, it's true that
  I'm not the man I used to be
  Oh Ruby, I still need some company.
  
  It's hard to love a man
  Whose legs are bent and paralysed
  And the wants and the needs
  Of a woman your age
  Ruby, I realise
  But it won't be long
  I've heard them say
  Until I'm not around
  Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town.
  
  She's leaving now
  'Cause I've just heard
  The slamming of the door
  The way I know I've heard it slam
  One hundred times before
  And if I could move
  I'd get my gun and put her in the ground
  Oh Ruby, don't take your love to town
  Oh Ruby, for God's sake turn around.
