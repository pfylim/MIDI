DIANA ROSS & JULIO IGLESIAS - ALL OF YOU

I never had this feeling before
I never wanted anyone more
And something in your eyes tells me
You feel the way that I do
I feel like you do
If you would like to stay here all night
You know that I would say it's alright
But though I'm saying yes I confess
I've got more on my mind
'Cause I want more of you than your time

All of your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams you've never told
I want everything and I'll take nothing less
All of you as long as you live
I want all of you that you can give
All your joys and all your sorrows
Your todays and your tomorrows

How I long to feel the warmth of your touch
And then if I'm not akin' too much
I'd like to spend my life wandering through
All the wonders of you
And when we're lying close in the dark
So close I feel each beat beat of your heart
I want you to reveal what you feel
All how you hold deep inside
There's nothing I want you to hide

All of you your body and soul
Every kind of love you can express
All the secret dreams you've never told
I want everything and I'll take nothing less
All of you as long as you live
Everything you want this love to be
And in return for all you're giving
Let me give you
All of me
