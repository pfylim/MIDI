COCK ROBIN - THOUGHT YOU WERE ON MY SIDE

Not without reason have I been wrong
Just a few tough demands
On a personal friend I could lean on
Desperate and selfish, I know that I was
We drank all our fill
But I'd swear there was poison in my cup
Of your good intentions what has become?
I thought you were on my side
Must you add the weight?
You said it would be even
When splitting up the stakes
I thought you were on my side
Were we not the rage?
Down the center line, 
What's yours is yours and mine
Just like always
Hurting for freedom, hell-bent for lust
It's unlikely thing that I'd be bumping in
To someone I could trust
I'm far from resigning,
Though I'm faint from exhaust
Just because I'm on edge
Do I have to let somebody come push me off?
Is it the belonging, or something you've lost
