Singer : THE RUBETTES 
Title  : I CAN DO IT

Yeah I can do it
Yeah I can do it
Yeah I can really rock
Ooh I can do it
I can really rock
Ooh I can do it
I can really rock
Ooh I can do it
I can really rock
I can do it
I can do it

Thinkin' 'bout guitars when I was just a kid
Just lookin' back on the things we did
Like hangin' round at the local hop
With my candy and my soda pop
I guess I never really stood a chance
I liked the music but I couldn't dance
I guess I really learnt a lot since then
'Cause I can really do it now it's back again
Yeah I can do it
I can do it
I can really move from my head right down
To my blue suede shoes
I can really make the groove
I can do it
I can do it
I can really move
Really move, yeah I can really move

Dancin' was trouble thinkin' 'bout it now
I had no girlfriend to show me how
I was too young to date to old to wait
It's kinda sad I was born too late
But like I said I learnt a lot since then
And I can really do it now it's back again
I can do the jive I can do the stroll
It's just another name for rock'n'roll
