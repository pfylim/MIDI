Singer : REDBONE 
Title  : ONE MORE TIME

Walk a tangles with his wife
He just feared for his life
He can't get a little of independence
Say your sister got a babe
Her man has gone away
She cries like a digger night in mud
Got no bread to pay the landlord
Got a song that I can sing
To clear my headache
One more time for your trouble
Can you say the hell we're in
Keep repeating

One more time for his wife
One more time for his life
One more time for all the independence
One more time for the rent
One more time for the man
One more time for sister and her baby
One more time is all you have to say, to get you by lord

One more time just a little bit (8x)

Say your brother got a jones
And he looks like skin and bones
He says he can kick it when he wants to
Oh your mama gonna feed
She is eating on the streets
And all your friend get the giggles
When she passed
Got no pride to find the world we're at
As my head is on my chest I'm looking downwards
One more time and then the problem
Got to straighten out my brain from going crazy
One more time for the jones
One more time for the bones
One more time for kicking when he wants to
One more time for the street
One more time for all the laughing faces

One more time for his wife
One more time for his life
One more time for all the independence
One more time for the rent
One more time for the man
One more time for sister and her baby
One more time is all you have to say, to get you by lord

One more time just a little bit (8x)
