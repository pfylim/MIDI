ROBBIE ROBERTSON - SOMEWHERE DOWN THE CRAZY RIVER

Yeah, I can see it now
The distant red neon shivered in the heat
I was feeling like a stranger in a strange land
You know where people play games with the night
God, it was too hot to sleep
I followed the sound of a jukebox coming from up the levee
All of a sudden I could hear somebody whistling
From right behind me
I turned around and she said
Why do you always end up down at Nick's cafe?
I said, I don't know, the wind just kind of pushed me this way
She said, Hang the rich

Refrain:
Catch the blue train
To places never been before
Look for me
Somewhere down the crazy river
Somewhere down the crazy river
Catch the blue train
All the way to Kokomo
You can find me
Somewhere down the crazy river
Somewhere down the crazy river

Take a picture of this
The fields are empty, abandoned '59 Chevy
Laying in the back seat listening to Little Willie John
Yes, that's when time stood still
You know, I think I'm gonna go down to Madam X
And let her read my mind
She said, That Voodoo stuff don't do nothing for me

I'm a man with a clear destination
I'm a man with a broad imagination
You fog the mind you stir the soul
I can't find no control

Refrain: ...

Wait, did you hear that
Oh this is sure stirring up some ghosts for me
She said, there's nothing you've got to learn
Is not to be afraid of it
I said, no, I like it, I like it, it's good
She says, You like it now
But you'll learn to love it later

I been spellbound, falling in trances
I been spellbound falling in trances
You give me the shivers, chills and fever
You give me the shivers, chills and fever
I been spellbound somewhere down the crazy river
