Singer : THE RUBINOOS 
Title  : PEEK-A-BOO

(Words & music: James Hamer)

When you come home from the dance
Sit in the hall
To make romance
When you do
The things you shouldn't do
Peek a boo
I'm watching you

When you ought to be at school
Learning about the golden rule
When you tell the tale that isn't true

Chorus:
Peek a boo
I'm watching you
Look in the dark
You'll see my face
Don't try to hide
I'm every place
Play it cool
Time is sweet
I'm gonna give you a treat

Hope you've learnt the things I've said
Now listen can they be in your head
When you dance the soles right off your shoes

Chorus: ...

Hope you've learnt the things I've said
Now listen can they be in your head
When you dance the soles right off your shoes
Peek a boo
I'm watching you
To the thing you shouldn't do
Peek a boo
I'm watching you
To the things you shouldn't do
Peek a boo
I'm watching you
