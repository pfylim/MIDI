Shake it up, do the boogaloo
Oh dance
Shake it up, do the boogaloo
Oh dance
Shake it up, do the boogaloo
Oh dance
Shake it up, do the boogaloo
Oh dance

How do I know
What do you see
This big whole town's not big enough for me
I try to call some people on the telephone
To yell help me out of here
But I couldn't reach one
I said yes I find your love I am wishing

You know love in you is something we must pay
All in you I never could got it
You must come around and try to move yourself

You know love in you is something we must pay
All in you I never could got it
You must come around and try to move yourself

Yes I take a trip on a left side
People used to take it on a right aside
Yes I take a trip on a left side
People used to take it on a right aside

You better keep on move it shake it
You better keep on move it shake it
You better keep and move you better keep and move

I feel so up
You feel so down
Music always shake in my body
I try to call some people on the telephone
To yell and help me once again
But I couldn't reach one

Yes I felt my mind over starlight
Coming up and coming down no way
Yes you know our life mean hot stuff
You better come around and try to move yourself

Yes I take a trip on a left side
People used to take it on a right aside
Yes I take a trip on a left side
People used to take it on a right aside
