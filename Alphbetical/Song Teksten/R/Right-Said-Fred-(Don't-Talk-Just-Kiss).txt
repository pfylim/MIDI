                      Don't lalk just kiss


Surrender me a kiss, let me lose on you inch by inch
The one and only reason is fun fun fun 
I said well baby, it 's only just begun

Refrain

So don't talk just kiss, we're the unworth and sound
Don't talk just kiss, let your tongue fool around,
let's fool around


Oh yeah, there's people, there's love
You and I hope to fly to the above
The one and only reason is fun fun fun
I said well baby, it's only just begun

Refrain

So don't talk just kiss, ...


Aha, we're wasting precious time
Don't talk, kiss, oh, make it mine
The one and only reason is fun fun fun
I said well baby, it's only just begun

(3x) Come on, come on, come on, come on fool around
Surrender your love to me

Refrain

Don't talk just kiss ...

Let's fool around
What do you say?

Fade out
