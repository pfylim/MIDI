One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute
One hundred and twenty five
You get the notion with the motion
Then you're out on the floor

Fahrenheit, one hundred and twenty two
Centigrade, it's getting to you
Your heart is beating, eight to the bar
You can't control it so you hold it
Then you're out on the floor

On the floor
You feel it coming to ya
On the floor
You kow it's getting through ya
On the floor
You can't control the feeling
Let it go

See the faces passing
Smile in time
See the faces passing
All in line
You say hey, can I take you home tonight?
But she knows that you're throwing a line
She's heard before, she'll hear it again
It's the same pitch everytime
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at here
Change your line of patter
Make her laugh, not at here

She tells you her friends wants to say hello
But say that you don't want to know
It's here that that you're throwing your glances to
Her that you want to know
Don't let her stray it's a saturday night
The boys are after trouble
You're in for a fight

One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute
One hundred and twenty five
You get the motion with the notion
Then you're out on the floor

Fahrenheit, one hundred and twenty two
Centigrade, it's getting to you
Your heart is beating, eight to the bar
You can't control it so you hold it
Then you're out on the floor

Reggae, reggae, reggae, reggae

See the faces passing
Smile in time
She says if you're looking to take her home
Well I'd better not be in late
But the look on her face
And the smile in her eyes say
Baby I'm gonna wait
See the faces swimming
Hear the music dimming
Well I'm all danced out, I'm all don in
And I'm starting to talk out of tune
We can go on a ride, we can jump in a boat
We can dance by the light of the moon
One hundred and twenty five
Beats to, beats to the minute
