THE REAL THING - 2 UNLIMITED


IT'S THE REAL THING THAT MAKES YOUR BODY SWING
OPEN YOUR EARS FOR THE TECHNO RAP SING
BACK ON THE TRACK
YOU TRY TO CRITICISE
SO NOW STEP BACK
I TRAVELLED THE WORLD ALL ROUND AND ROUND
MADE A LOT OF HEADS GO UPSIDE DOWN
IF IT AIN'T ROUGH  IT AIN'T NOTHING
LET YOURSELF GO 'CAUSE YOU'RE ROLLING
WITH THE REAL THING

WE'RE GOING FOR THE REAL THING
GO! GO! LET YOURSELF GO! GO! GO! LET YOURSELF GO!
SEARCHIN' FOR THE REAL THING
DO THIS, DO TIS, COME ON, COME ON
DO THIS, DO THIS!

NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL THING
NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE GOING FOR THE REAL THING
I SELECT THE THOUGHTS AND NEEDS
FROM THE PEOPLE'S MIND
COMBINE IT WITH MY OWN STYLE
I AIN'T BLIND
ONE OF THE KIND, MAKE SURE I'LL FIND
A WAY TO GAIN AND WIN
'CAUSE IT'S ABOUT TIME
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION, ARE YOU OUT, ARE YOU IN?
'CAUSE IF YOU ROLL
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH THE REAL THING

SEARCHIN' FOR THE REAL THING
DO THIS, DO TIS, COME ON, COME ON
DO THIS, DO THIS!
WE'RE GOING FOR THE REAL THING
GO! GO! LET YOURSELF GO! GO! LET YOURSELF GO!

NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL THING
NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL THING
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL WE REACH THE HIGHEST TOP
WE DON'T NEED TO STOP
WE'LL KEEP ON SEARCHING TILL WE DROP

TA RA RAP, THE REAL THING YEAH
GIMME THE REAL THING YEAH YEAH YEAH
LET YOURSELF GO! LET YOURSELF GO!
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL THING
NO MORE WAITING, ANTICIPATING
WE'RE SEARCHING FOR THE REAL THING
