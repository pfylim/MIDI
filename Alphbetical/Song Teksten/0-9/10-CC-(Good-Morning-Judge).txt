Title  : GOOD MORNING JUDGE

(Words & music: Eric Stewart/Graham Gouldman)

Well good morning Judge how are you today
I'm in trouble please put me away
A pretty thing took a shine to me
I couldn't stop her so let it be
I couldn't stop her so let it be
I couldn't stop her so let it be
I couldn't stop her so let it be
He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare

Well good morning Judge, yes I'm back again
I'm in trouble so it's back to the pen
I found a car but I couldn't pay
I fell in love and I drove it away
I fell in love and I drove it away
I fell in love and I drove it away
I fell in love and I drove it away
He didn't do it, he wasn't there
He didn't want it, he wouldn't dare

I didn't do it, he wasn't there
I didn't want it, he wouldn't dare

Alcatraz is like home sweet home
I'm so wanted and I'm never alone
San Quentin is the place to be
I'm so happy and I don't wanna be free
So happy I don't wanna be free
So happy I don't wanna be free
So happy I don't wanna be free
