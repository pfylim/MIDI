10. No-One - 2 Unlimited

I've been searching' a long time
And I just don't know
I try to catch solutions
I try to catch the flow
Thoughts running through my mind
Maybe the man in the front. Yo
Was the man from behind
Where is the place where I don't
Have to watch my back
When I can just go out
Without protecting my sex
Will it come?
No-one knows, hey yo, no-one knows

Chorus:
No-one can resist the desire
To escape to paradise
It seems like there's nothing else to do
Than to dream and fantasize

You better recognize
When I pass your way
It's the techno rap singer
By the name of Ray
Can we compromise
To have a better place
Can we reach the goal
To have an equal race
So amazing
How things change
But we're growing up
So it ain't that strange
The inspiration comes through the nation
Will it last?
No-one knows, no-one knows

Chorus

No-one knows, yo, will I know
Like Janet Jackson
"That's the way love goes"
My mind's playing tricks
There's no way out
No-one can hear you
Not even if you shout
I feel the pressure
You cannot measure
Time will tell
Heaven or hell
Now will the world survive nowadays
No-one knows, hey yo, no-one knows
