Singer : ALBERT HAMMOND 
Title  : THE AIR THAT I BREATHE

If I could make a wish I think I'd pass
I can't think of anything I need
No cigarettes no sleep no light no sound
Nothing to eat no books to read
Making love with you left me peaceful warm and tired
What more could I ask, there's nothing left to be desired
Peace came up on me and it leaves me weak
Sleep silent angel go to sleep

Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe
And to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
Yes to love you
All I need is the air that I breathe
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah...
