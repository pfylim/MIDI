Title  : WIGGLE THAT WOTSIT

(Words & music: Allan Clarke/Tony Hicks/Terry Sylvester)

Wiggle
Wiggle that
Wiggle that wot
Wiggle that wotsit

Wiggle that wotsit
Shakin' that shimmy
Bring it up to me
Ring-a-ding-a-ling me
Turn me on

Wiggle that wotsit
Shake it up
Shake it down
Serve me up another round
Rub-a-dub-a-hug me
Turn me on

Lord you know
How crazy it makes me
You tear my insides out
The pleasure in the pain
Is so excruciating
Give me a hard time

You gonna blow my dynamo
My wheels ain't gonna touch the ground
Heaven knows how I'm gonna cope
With this situation
It makes me wanna shout
Give me a hard time
