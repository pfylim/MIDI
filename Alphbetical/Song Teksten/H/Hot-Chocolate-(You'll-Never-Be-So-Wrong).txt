Title  : YOU'LL NEVER BE SO WRONG
Artist : HOT CHOCOLATE

(Words & music: Ricky Wilde/Marty Wilde)

Just two lovers in a seedy cafe
Someone's leavin' the waiter says
Hey, won't you wait
Running nowhere she hides in her room
What he told her was
He had to get out and soon

It's just a bad affair you've had
No need to cry, don't take it bad
You'll soon be glad when you're far apart

Chorus:
You'll never be so wrong
Not for a long time
You'll never be so wrong
Not for a long time
'Cause you're never gonna find that feeling again
You're never gonna find that feeling again

Now she's breakin' but what can she do
Somewhere out there a car disappears out of view
Fumbles somewhere for stale cigarettes
Looks for numbers, the one she can dial for pence

No point in you just looking down
No way that you can turn it around
You've got to realise you're free

Chorus: ...
