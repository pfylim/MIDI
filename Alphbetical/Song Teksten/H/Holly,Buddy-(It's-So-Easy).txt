It's so easy to fall in love,
it's so easy to fall in love.

People tell me love's for fools,
So hear I go breaking all of the rules.
It seems so easy, so doggone easy;
It seems so easy, where you're concerned my
heart has learned;
It's so easy to fall in love,
it's so easy to fall in love.

Look into your heart and see,
what your love book has set apart for me.
It seems so easy, so doggone easy;
It seems so easy, where you're concerned my
heart has learned;
It's so easy to fall in love,
it's so easy to fall in love.
