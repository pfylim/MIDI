Title  : Have a Little Faith in Me
Singer : John Hiatt


When the roads get dark
And you can no longer see
Just let my love throw a spark
And have a little faith in me
And when the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Just give these loving arms a try
And have a little faith in me, and

Refrein:
Have a little faith in me (4x)

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
Come here darlin'
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me
And when your back's against the wall
Just turn around and you will see
I will catch, I will catch your fall baby
Just have a little faith in me

Refrein

Well, I've been loving you for such a long time girl
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me
You see time, time in our friend
'Cause for us there is no end
And all you gotta do have a little faith in me
I said I will hold you up, I will hold you up
Your love gives me strength enough
So have a little faith in me.
