HOT HOUSE FLOWERS - DON'T GO

(Words & music: Peter O'Toole/Fiachna O'Braonain/Liam O'Maonlai)

There's a smell of fresh cut grass
And it's filling up my senses
And the sun is shining down
On the blossoms in the Avenue
There's a buzzing fly
Hanging round the bluebells and the daisies
There's a lot more loving
Left in this world

Don't go
Don't leave me now, now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while

And I'm lying warm on the soft sandy beaches
And my toes are submerged in the water
And it feels good
Children playing building castles on the shoreline
Like a painting that we loved
Lord it feels so fine

Don't go
Don't leave me now, now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while

There's white horses and they're coming at me at a pace now
There's blue scirocco blowing warm into my face
The sun is shining on the underside of the bridges
And there's a car going by with smiles in the windows

And there's a black cat lying in the shadows of a gatepost
And the black cat tells me that love is on its way

Don't go
Don't leave me now, now now
While the sun smiles
Stick around and laugh a while
Stick around and laugh a while
