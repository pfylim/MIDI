Singer : HOT CHOCOLATE
Title  : NO DOUBT ABOUT IT

(Words & music: D. Most/S. Glen/M Burns)

If someone tells you there's no other form of life
And you believe in that too
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the other night
I swear that it's true
A cloud of white and greend and flying ships I've never seen
Came into my view

Was I frightened?
Was I scared?
Was I thrown into confusion?
As they glided down so silently
It wasn't an illusion
Oh, no doubt about it
Oh, no doubt about it

What kid of magnetism kept me in this place
Was it out of my control?
What was this ship from out of space?
What was this creature that appeared before my eyes?
Was it good, was it evel, on this ship from other skies?

I was frightened
I was scared
I was thrown into confusion
As they stood right there in front of me
It wasn't an illusion
Oh, no doubt about it
Oh, no doubt about it

Stood right there in front of me
What can they be?
No illusion
No no no doubt about it
