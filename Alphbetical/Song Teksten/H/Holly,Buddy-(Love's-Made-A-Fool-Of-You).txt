You know love makes a fool of you,
you do anything it a wants you to !
Love can make you feel so good
when it goes like you think it should !
Or it can make you cry at night,
when your baby don't treat you right;

when you're feelin' sad and blue,
you know love's a made a fool of you.

You know love makes fools of men,
but you don't care, you're gonna try again !
Time goes by it's a passing fast,
you think true love a has come at last !
Bye and bye you're gonna find,
crazy love a has a made you blind;

when you're feelin' sad and blue,
you know love's a made a fool of you !
You know love's a made a fool of you !
