DARYL HALL - DREAMTIME

I saw you standing and I felt your rage
Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking thru the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl I know what to believe

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You wanna run away don't care where to go
You wanna run away that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie

REFRAIN:
You're living in Dreamtime baby
It's time to wake up
You're living in Dreamtime baby
It's time to shape up

In your dream it's overcast
Rain comes down movin' your way fast
You wanna run away
Don't care where to go
You wanna run away
That's all you know
Turn a corner then you see a door

Walk thru throw yourself on the floor
When you're looking up it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with Movie Star Eyes
Think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that you'll see thru

I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie

REFRAIN: ...

I never saw anyone fell apart so fast
Living in Dreamtime you know it ain't gonna last
Never saw anyone think she's so right
And be wrong
Living in Dreamtime
It's hard to carry on
