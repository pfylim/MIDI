HOLLYWOOD BEYOND - WHAT'S THE COLOR OF MONEY?

Dull my senses steal my pride principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
Color of the virtue by working like a slave more precious
Than life itself what's the color tempting fate

What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red

Dull my senses steal my pride principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
What was the useful tool has taken our control it takes away
Your heart and wraps it up around your soul

What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red

What's the color of money, what's the color of money
I know it's red, I know it's red

Dull my senses steal my pride principles denied
Passion faked and sold to the anthem green and gold
Color of the virtue by working like a slave more precious
Than life itself familiarity breeds contempt

What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
Don't tell me that you think it's green, me I know it's red

What's the color of money, what's the color of money
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
What's the color of money, what's the color of money
