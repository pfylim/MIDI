8. HYMN - BARCLAY JAMES HARVEST

Chorus:
Valleys deep and the mountains so high.
If you wanna see God you`ve got to move on the other side.
Stand up there with your head in the clouds.
Don`t try to fly you know you might not come down.
Don`t try to fly, dear God, you might not come down.

Jesus came down from heaven to earth.
The people said it was a virgin birth.
Jesus came down from heaven to earth.
The people said it was a virgin birth.  
The people said it was a virgin birth.  

He told great stories of the Lord.
And said he was the saviour of us all.
He told great stories of the Lord.
And said he was the saviour of us all.
And said he was the saviour of us all.

For this we killed and nailed him up high.
He rose again as if to ask us why.
And he ascended into the sky.
As if to say in God alone you soar.
As if to say in God alone we fly.
