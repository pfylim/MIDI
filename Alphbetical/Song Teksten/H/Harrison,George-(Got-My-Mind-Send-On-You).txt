      Got my mind send on you        George Harrison


I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you.

But it's gonna take money, a whole lotta spending money,
It's gonna take plenty of money to do it right, child.
It's gonna take time, a whole lotta precious time,
It's gonna take patience and time to do it, to do it,
To do it, to do it, to do it, to do it right, child.

I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you.

And this time I know it's real, the feeling that I feel,
I know if I put my mind to it, I know that I really can do it.
I got my mind set on you, set on you,
I got my mind set on you, set on you.

But it's gonna take money , a whole lotta spending money, ...

I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you,
I got my mind set on you, I got my mind set on you.

And this time I know it's real, the feeling that I feel,
I know if I put my mind to it, I know that I really can do it.
But it's gonna take money, a whole lotta spending money, ...

Set on you, set on you, set on you, set on you,
Set on you, set on you, set on you, set on you,
Set on you, set on you, set on you, set on you.
