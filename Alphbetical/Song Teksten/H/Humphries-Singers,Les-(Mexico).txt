  MEXICO
  (REPEAT 6 TIMES)
  
  IN 1580 WE SENT OUR LITTLE SHIP
  AROUND THE COAST OF AFRICA
  DOWN THE GAZA STRIP
  WE TOOK SOME SALTY BACON
  AND A HAMMOCK FOR A BED
  THEN WE MIXED IT WITH THE SPANIARDS
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MED
  
  (CHORUS)
  WELL, WE FIRED OUR GUNS
  SO THE PRETTY GIRLS ARE COMING
  THERE WASN'T QUITE AS MANY
  AS THERE WAS A WHILE AGO
  WE HAD SOME MORE
  AND THEN WE STARTED RUNNING
  ON DOWN THE MISSISSIPPI
  TO THE GULF OF MEXICO
  
  MEXICO
  (REPEAT 5 TIMES)
  
  WELL, FRANCIS DRAKE SAID
  IF YOU REALLY WANT A FIGHT
  THE BEST THING IS TO CATCH THEM
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
  WE HOISTED ANCHOR AND POWERED UP THE GUN
  THEN WE SAILED AROUND IN CIRCLES
  AND JUST WAITED FOR THE SUN
  
  (CHORUS)
  
  MEXICO

  WELL, CANNON BALLS FLEW
  AND THE SHIP BEGAN TO SINK
  THE WATER STARTED RISING
  SO WE REALLY HAD TO THINK
  AND THEN BY CHANCE A MAN CAME ON THIS BOAT
  SO WE GRABBED HIM BY THE TROUSERS
  AND PUT HIM IN THE HOLD
  
  (CHORUS)
  
  MEXICO
  (REPEAT 5 TIMES)
  
  WELL, WE FIRED FROM THE PROW
  AND WE FIRED FROM THE BACK
  AND THEN WE FIRED FROM THE GALLEY
  AND THROUGH EVERY LITTLE CRACK
  WE FIRED SO MUCH
  THAT THE COOK STARTED COOKING
  DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
  SO WE THREW THE UNION JACK
  
  (CHORUS REPEAT 1 TIME)
