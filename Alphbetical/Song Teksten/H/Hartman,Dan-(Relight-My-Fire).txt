Title  : RELIGHT MY FIRE

(Words & music: Dan Hartman)

Help me escape this feelin' of insecurity
I need you so much but I don't think you really need me
Well if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you
But like a thief in the night, you took away
The love that I knew

Chorus:
Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, 'cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happening, I was there with you
Well if we all stand up for what we believe
And then eliminate the possibilities
The world would be one broken dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Got to be strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side
Got to have hope in your soul
Just keep on walkin', yeah yeah
Just keep on walkin', yeah yeah
Just keep on, I'll keep on, I, I, I'm
Strong enough to walk on through the night
And I see day on the other side
And I got hope in my soul, so I'll keep walkin' yeah
Keep walkin' yeah

Relight my fire
