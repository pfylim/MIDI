A Whiter Shade of Pale       Procul Harum 


We skipped the light fandango
Turned cartwheels cross the floor .
I was feeling kind of sea-sick
But the crowd called out for more .
The room was huming harder
As the ceiling flew away ,
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray .

Refrain 

And so it was the later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale


She said there is no reason 
And the truth is plain to see ,
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be .
One of sixteen vestal virgins ,
Who were leaving for the coast .
And although my eyes were open 
They might just have well be closed

Refrain

And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly 
Turned a whiter shade of pale .
