PAUL HARDCASTLE - 19

In 1965 Vietnam seemed like just another foreign war
But it wasn't, it was different in many ways
And so were those who did the fighting
In world war two the average age
of the combat soldier was twenty-six
In Vietnam he was nineteen
I-i-i-i-i-i-in Vietnam he was nineteen
I-i-i-i-i-i-in Vietnam he was nineteen
I-i-i-i-i-i-in Vietnam he was nineteen
N-n-n-n-n-nineteen

The heaviest fight of the past two weeks
Continued today twenty-five miles north-west of Saigon
I wasn't really sure what was going on

N-n-n-n-n-nineteen nineteen
nineteen nineteen nineteen

In Vietnam the combat soldier typically
Served a twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire
Almost everyday

N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nineteen

In Saigon a U.S. military spokesman said today
More than seven hundred enemy troops were killed last week
In that sensitive border area
Throughout all of south Vietnam
The enemy lost a total of two thousand, six hundred,
eighty-nine soldiers

All those who remembered the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average age was nineteen

D-d-d-des-d-des-d-destruction
D-d-d-des-d-des-d-destruction

According to a veterans administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans
Suffer from what psychiatrists call
Post-dramatic stress disorder
Many vets complained of alienation rage or guilt
Some succumbed to suicidal thoughts
Eight too ten years after coming home
Almost eight hundred thousand men
Are still fighting the Vietnam war

None of them received a hero's welcome
