10. RED ROSES FOR MY LADY - ENGELBERT

When I am a million miles away
There is so much I want to say.
Oh I wish that you where here babe.
Now I got a feeling coming on.
I`ve been away for much to long.
Oh I want to feel you near me.
I wish that you could hear me.

Chorus
Red roses for my lady.
Red roses just to say.
How much I miss my baby.
And I`ll be back today.
Red roses for my lady.
Red roses just for you.
You know they mean forever
And forever.
My love will always be true.

You will be the Lady of my heart.
You were the woman from the start.
Such cruel sophistication.
You are more to me than just my girl.
You are the center of my world.
And if you like the situation
Here`s an open invitation.

Chorus

Red roses for my lady.
Red roses just to say.
How much I miss my baby.
And I`ll be back someday.
