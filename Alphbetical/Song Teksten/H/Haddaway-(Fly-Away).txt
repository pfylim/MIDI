
6. Haddaway - Fly Away

It's a dream of worlds in motion
Another place and time
I guess I'm feeling lost in 
The home I thought was mine
It's a universal motion
Life is just a battlefield
Open your heart for someone
Nothing is revealed.

Fly away
You can leave it all behind you 
I'm on my way to find you
And I'll soon be flying too
Fly away
We can fly together
I'm talking about forever
This is all we gotta do:
Fly away...

It's a tangled-up emotion
Will you stay or will you go
I'm the one to count on 
If only you could know

Fly away
You can leave it all behind you
I'm on my way to find you
And I'll soon be flying too
Fly away
We can fly together
I'm talking about forever
This is all we gotta do:
Fly away...
