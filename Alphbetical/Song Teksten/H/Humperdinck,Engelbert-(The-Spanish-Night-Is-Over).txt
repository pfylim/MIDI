
    The spanish night is over  -   Engelbert Humperdinck


Once upon a lonely time in Barcelona, Spain
she was just a simple girl, Maria was her name,
through the night we fell in love
the morning brings goodbye.
Now I spent the rest of my life wondering why.

Refrain

The spanish night is over, and here
I am again, holding just a hard full of 
memories that never end.
The spanish night is over , but still I'm dreaming of
How we were together the night we fell in love .


Ev'ry night I close my eyes and hold her in my sleep ,
Though it was so long ago her memory I will keep .
Some of us were meant to win , others meant to lose ,
But I'd never have dreamed I'd be still losing you .

Refrain

The spanish night is over , ...


The spanish night is over , but still I'm dreaming of
How we were together the night we fell in love ,
How we were together the night we fell in love .
