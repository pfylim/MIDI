HALL & OATES - ADULT EDUCATION

Afternoon in the home room they're about to let you go
And the lockers slam on the plan you had tonight
You've been messing around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could put you right
In the lot the boy that's going by doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots he shares with you
And long halls and grey walls gonna split apart

Refrain:
Believe it or not, there's life after high school
And that's why the student's body got a bad reputation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
What they need is adult education
Back to school it's a bad situation
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
The teacher don't know about how to deal
With the student boy
And the under-class mew are flashing hot and cool
All your girlfriends care about watch and wear
And talkin' about it

Refrain: ...

They're calling it a preparation, you're waiting
For a separation
You're nothing but another odd number
Memories that you won't remember
So you got a little education and a lot of dedication
But you want a little night-school
Maybe some of it will rub off on you

Refrain: ...

The boys are busy looking in the mirrors
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender
More memories that you won't remember
The seniors with the junior miss 'A'
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Adult education, adult education
