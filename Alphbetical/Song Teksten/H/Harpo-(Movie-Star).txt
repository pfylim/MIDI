
                  Movie Star           Harpo


You feel like Steve McQueen, when you're drivin' in your car,
an' you think you look like James Bond,
when you're smokin' your cigar, it's so bizarre.
You think you are, a new kind of James Dean,
but the only thing I've ever seen of you,
was a commercial spot on the screen.

Movie star, oh movie star, ya think you are a movie,
Movie star, oh movie star, ya think you are a movie,
star ah-ah-ha.

You should belong to the jet-set, fly your own private Lear jet,
but you worked in the grocery store every day,
until you could afford to get away.
So you went to Sweden to meet Ingmar Bergman,
he wasn't there, or he just didn't care,
I think it's time for you my friend,
to stop pretending that you are a

Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh, ya think you are a movie,
Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh, ya think you are a movie,
star ah-ah-ha.

Frozen hero, your works are zero, 
an' your dreams are banished into dark, long ago, 
but you don't want to know.

Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh, ya think you are a movie,
Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh, ya think you are a movie,
Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh, ya think you are a movie,
star, movie star, ah-ah-ha, a movie star, oh-oh-oh.

Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh,
Movie star, a movie star, oh-oh-oh.
