     Come here, sweet girl, le-et me ho-Old you,.....
     I'll kiss the tiredness a-awa--ay.....
     there's so many good things I owe you.....
     and you're gonna have them all some da-ay.....

     Got no money, no place to go,...but we can dance to the radio...
     'cause you can't go wrong with a favourite song,
     an' Michael Jackson in stereo...

     Get the bottle, I need some wine,...
     I want your body, love, ever close to mine.
     Got a private sho-ow,...dancing to the radio.....

     SHORT BRIDGE..........

     One day, I'm gonna take you to London,.....
     we'll stay at a fancy hotel.....
     And baby, you'll..knock 'em dead..in the disco,.....
     but tonight, this'll do just a-as well.....

     Got no money, no place to go,...
     but we can dance to the radio...
     'cause you can't go wrong with a favourite song,
     an' Michael Jackson in stereo...

     Get the bottle, I need some wine,...
     I want your body, love, ever clo--se to mine.
     Got a private show...dancing to the radio.....

     Got no money, no place to go,...but we can dance to the radio...
     'cause you can't go wrong with a favourite song,
     an' Michael Jackson in stereo...

     Get the bottle, I need some wine,...
     I want your body, love, ever clo--se to mine.
     Got a private show-ow... dancing to the radio-o.....

     SOLO.............................................................

     Get the bottle, I need some wine,...
     I want your body, love, ever clo--se to mine.
     Got a private show-ow... dancing to the radio-o.....

     Got no money, no place to go,...but we can do it to the radio...
     'cause you can't go wrong with a favourite song,
     an' Michael Jackson in stereo...

     Get the bottle, I need some wine,...
     I want your body, love, ever clo--se to mine....
