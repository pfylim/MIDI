WHITNEY HOUSTON - ALL AT ONCE

All at once, I fin'ly took a moment
And I'm realizing that you're not coming back
And it fin'ly hit me, all at once
All at once, I started counting teardrops
And at least a million fell
My eyes began to swell
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once

Refrain:
Ever since I met you
You're the only love I've known
And I can't forget you
Tho' I must face it all at once
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you come back to me
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Holding on to memories
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows, all at once

All at once I looked around
And found that you were with another one
In someone elses arms
And all my dreams were shattered, all at once
All at once, the smile that used to greet me
Brightens some elses day, she took your smile away
And left me with just mem'ries, all at once

Refrain: ...

All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
Wishing you come back to me
And it hurts me more than you know
So much more than it shows, all at once
And that's all that matters now
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea
