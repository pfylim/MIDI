Title  : SINCE I MET YOU BABY

(Words & music: Ivory Joe Hunter)

Since I met you baby, my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby, my whole life has changed
And everybody tells me that I am not the same
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby, all I need is you

(Spoken:)
From the first day you stepped into my life
You let me up like a christmas tree
That was one of the good things
You've done to me baby
And darling when we're walking hand in hand
I feel like I'm the ruler of my land
And you're my queen

Since I met you baby, I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby, I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can
