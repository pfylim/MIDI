Singer : ALBERT HAMMOND 
Title  : NEW YORK CITY

Give me a smile
Do you know what it's worth
And if you gave me an acre
I'll give you the earth
And if you give me a start
I ain't gonna stop
I'll be flyin' from rooftop
To rooftop to rooftop if you

Give me a room
I'll come home each night
And if you show me the switch
Baby I'll turn on the light
And if you show me a tear
I'll give you some hope
I'll have you climbing the walls
If you give me the rope

Hang on to your hat
Oo oo oo oo New York City here I come
Hang on to your hat
Oo oo oo oo New York City here I come

Show me the park
Sunday after lunch
And we'll go back to your room
When it comes to the crunch
And if you give me the day
I'll give you the night
If you pretend you are sleeping
I'll put up a fight

Hang on to your hat
Oo oo oo oo New York City here I come
Hang on to your hat
Oo oo oo oo New York City here I come
