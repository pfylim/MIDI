                  ITSY-BITSY, TEENY-WEENY, YELLOW POLKA-DOT BIKINI                       

     As performed by: Bryan Hyland                                     


     Bop bop bop bop bo-dop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

     She was afraid to come out of the locker...
     She was nervous as she-e could be...
     She was afraid to come out of the locker...
     She was afraid that somebody would see.
     Two, three, four, tell the people what what she wore...

     It was an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     that she wore for the first time today...
     An itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     So in the locker..she wanted to stay.
     Two, three, four, stick around, we'll tell ya more.
     Bop bop bop bop bo-dop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

     She was afraid to come out in the open..(ba-da-dap)
     and so a blanket, around her, she wore..(ba-da-dap)
     She was afraid to come out in the open..(ba-da-dap)
     And so she sat in the lip on the shore. 
     Two, three, four, tell the people what what she wore...

     It was an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     that she wore for the first time today...
     An itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     So in the blanket..she wanted to stay.
     Two, three, four, stick around, we'll tell ya more.
     Bop bop bop bop bo-dop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

     Now, she's afraid to come out of the water..(ba-da-dap)
     And I wonder what she's gonna do..(ba-da-dap)
     Now, she's afraid to come out of the water..(ba-da-dap)
     And the poor little girl's turnin' blue.
     Two, three, four, tell the people what what she wore...

     It was an itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     that she wore for the first time today..
     An itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, yellow polka-dot bikini..
     So in the locker..she wanted to stay...

     (From the locker to the blanket,..from the blanket to the shore)...
     (From the shore to the water)...guess there isn't any more!...
