Title  : DISCO CALYPSO
Artist : OSCAR HARRIS

(Words & music: Laverman/Van Hanenberg)

Calypso boy was working on the beach
Sha la la la la la
Rum and reggae always in reach
Sha la la la la la
Teeth just like the northern snow
Cut off reggae bands
Tourists called him Dancing Joe
Stand still, no I can't

Chorus:
Disco go calypso, cuba libre and a mango
Disco go calypso, cuba libre and a mango
Disco go calypso, cuba libre and a mango

When it's cold in Winnipeg
Sha la la la la la
The lady cries 'Oh such a drag'
Sha la la la la la
Fly the Jamaican sun
To get a perfect tan
When the day has just begun
She knows that Joe's her man

Chorus: ...

The rusty locks hang on her shoulder
Sha la la la la la
She fell in love with what he told her
Sha la la la la la
They dance the disco every night
Along the quiet beach
The drink and talk and laugh till night
Nothing left to teach

Chorus: ...
