Never could belive the things you do to me,
Never could belive the way you are.  
Ev'ry day I bless the day that you got through to me,
'Cos baby, I belive that you're a star.

Ev'ryone's a winner, baby, that's the truth,
Making love to you is such a thrill.
Ev'ryone's a winner, baby that's no lie,
You never fail to satisfy. Let's do it again.

Never could explain just what was happening to me,
Just one touch of you and I'm a flame.
Baby, it's amazing just how wonderful it is,
That the things we like to do are just the same.
