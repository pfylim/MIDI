Singer : HANK THE KNIFE & THE JETS 
Title  : STAN THE GUNMAN

He's gonna come at night, 'till the morning's light
He's gonna turn the upside down
He's gonna steel the show, to let the people know
That he's the number one in town
So if you feel the fear, when his men appear
It's better that you stay away, another day yeah
And like a movie star, in his super car
He's gonna make a big entree
He's winning every game so isn't it a shame
That ev'ryone around will say

Refrain:
It's alright and don't you start a fight
Because he's Stan the gunman
Better run and hide
(He's killing) any man, to make you understand
That he's the very dangerous, one and only
Stan the gunman, Stan the gunman

But then the other day he couldn't get away
Policemen all around the place
His apes were far away, but Stan was there to play
He lost his game and pokerface
He tried to draw his gun because he couldn't run
But Stan he knew, this is the day
I'll have to pay yeah
A shot that didn't fail
Did put 'em into jail
But there's another Stan today
Who's winning ev'ry game, so isn't it a shame
That ev'ry one around will say

Refrain: ...
