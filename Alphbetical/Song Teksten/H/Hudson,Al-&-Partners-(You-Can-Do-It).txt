Title  : YOU CAN DO IT

(Words & music: Alicia Myers/K. McCord)

Dance, let your body go
You know you can do it, like me
Me eeny meeny miny moe
There is really nothing to it

Dance, let your body go
You know you can do it, like me
Me eeny meeny miny moe
There is really nothing to it

You can do it
And you know that you can
There's nothing to it
Just go ahead and do your dance

You can do it
And you know that you can
There's nothing to it
Just go ahead and do your dance

Get up and do your thing
And don't you be ashamed
Get up and do your thing
And don't you be ashamed

You know you can do it
So get up and move your body to it
Don't be afraid to do your thing
No such word as being ashamed
Everybody boogie tonight

Get up and do your thing
And don't you be ashamed
You can do it and you know that you can
There's nothing to it
Just go ahead and do your dance

Get up and do your thing and don't you be ashamed
Everybody get up and dance
This is the time
And this is your chance
Do your thing, come on
Get up and let your body go
