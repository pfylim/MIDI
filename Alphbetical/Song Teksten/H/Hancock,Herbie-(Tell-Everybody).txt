Title  : TELL EVERYBODY
               
(Words & music: H. Hancock/D. Rubinson/B. Good/J. Cohen)

Who's gonna climb the mountain
Who's gonna set you free
Who's got the inspiration
Who's gonna hold the key

Tell everybody
Who's gonna turn the tables
Tell everybody
Who's gonna change the deal
Tell everybody
Who's gonna find an answer
Who, if it isn't you

Tell everybody
We got a funky situation
Tell everybody
We got a funky celebration
Goin' down

Nobody's got the answer
No matter what they say
Well you don't have to worry
We gonna find a way

Tell everybody
Did you ever wonder
Tell everybody
Why things are like they are
Tell everybody
This is your lucky number
Shine, shine, shine, you're a shining star
