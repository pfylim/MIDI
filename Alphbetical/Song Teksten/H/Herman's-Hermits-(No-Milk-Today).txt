No milk today my love has gone away
the bottle stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.
No milk today it seems acommon sight but people 
passing by don't know the reason why.
How could they know just what this message means
the end of my hopes the end of all my dreams.

No milk today it wasn't always so 
the company was gay we turned night into day.
As music played the faster did we dance
we felt it both at once the start of our romance.

How could they know a palace there had been 
behind the door where my love reigned as queen.

No milk today my love has gone away the bottle
stands forlorn, a symbol of the dawn.
No milk today it seems a common sight but people
passing by don't know the reason why.

But all that's left is a place dark and lonely
a terraced house in a mean street back of town.

Becomes a shrine when I think of you 
only just two up two down
