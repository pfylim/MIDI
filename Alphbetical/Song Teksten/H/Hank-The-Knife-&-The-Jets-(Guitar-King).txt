Singer : HANK THE KNIFE & THE JETS 
Title  : GUITAR KING

Only eighteen almost grown
Tryin' his luck away from home
The guitar in his hand won't leave his side
The way he plays he should go far
One day he'll be a record star
And people come from far to watch him play

He makes you dance and he makes you sing
Come on let's go for the guitar king
His music is like honey for the bee
He makes you dance and he makes you sing
Come on let's go for the guitar king
He makes you dance and sing, he's the guitar king

On the stage he's dynamite
Drivin' people wild each night
He lets it rock like no one did before
Ev'ry week he's on TV
And shows you what you want to see
He shakes his legs until the lights go out

He comes along just in time
Turns everything in gold
He writes a song a million copies sold
He plays his music loud'n'clear
Destroying like a flame
A newborn king is on his way to fame
