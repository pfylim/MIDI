Singer : THE HOLLIES 
Title  : SANDY

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights our carnival live forever
Oh love me tonight
For I may never see you again
Hey Sandy, girl, my my my my baby
Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over Little Eden tonight
Forcin' a light into all those stony face
Left stranded on this warm July
And the boys from the casino dance with
Their shirts open like latin lovers on the shore
Chasin' all those silly New York virgins by the score

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights our carnival live forever
Oh love me tonight
I promise I'll love you forever
Oh I mean it Sandy-girl
Oh my baby, hey Sandy-girl
My my my my baby

Sandy the waitress I was seeing's lost her
desire for me
I spoke with her last night she said
she won't set herself on fire for me anymore
Didn't you hear the cops finally busted
Madame Marie for tellin' fortunes better
than they do
For me this boardwalk life's through,
You ought to quit this scene too

Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us
Those pier lights our carnival live forever
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again

Hey Sandy girl
My my my my baby
Hey Sandy girl
My my my my baby
Hey Sandy girl
Oh my baby
