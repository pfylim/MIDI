WHITNEY HOUSTON - ONE MOMENT IN TIME

(Words & music: J. Bettis/A. Hammond)

Each day I live I want to be
A day to give the best of me
I'm only one but not alone
My finest day is yet unknown
I broke my heart for every gain
To taste the sweet I faced the pain
I rise and fall yet through it al
This much remains, I want

Refrain:
One moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all my dreams are heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment in time
I will feel I will feel eternity
Mm mmm

I've lived to be the very best
I want it all
No time for mess
I've laid the plans
Now lay the chance
Here in my hands give me

Refrain: ...

Oh you're a winner for a lifetime
If you seize that one moment in time
Make it shine give me
One moment in time
When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all my dreams are a heartbeat away
And the answers are all up to me
Give me one moment in time
When I'm racing with destiny
Then in that one moment in time
I will be, I will be
I will be free oh
I will be, I will be free
