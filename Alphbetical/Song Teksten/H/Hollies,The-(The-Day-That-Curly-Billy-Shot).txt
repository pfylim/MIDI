Title  : THE DAY THAT CURLY BILLY SHOT DOWN CRAZY SAM MAGEE

Big tall man standing in the street
Gun hanging by his side
Just one man  that he'd like to meet
That's when I began to hide
I recognized him from the face of his son
The hate in his eyes didn't lie
And what I did can't be undone
Borrowed time there's none to buy
Well I hid round the back of a derelict shack
Ain't lookin' for a mad show down
But he was smart, he'd already checked
A week in advance I'd paid down
Well, the hotel clerk was a fun lovin' man
The job he had it didn't pay
He told me all about what happened that night
There he is, that's the one, 's all he'd say
Well, all the people were runnin' jumpin'
even thumpin' on my bad neighbours' door
Cryin' Curly Billy silly with his Colt he calls Filly
Let me in I got to hide
Well ev'rybody was cryin', sighin' Sam Magee's dyin'
No-one to protect our town
Curly Billy's silly with his Colt he calls Filly
He's gonna shoot the sheriff down

Big tall man standing in the street
Now a hand hoverin' ready to slide
Drew out his gun, it was not for fun
Let me in, there's nowhere to hide
Well I made my play but it wasn't my day
I felt the ripping lead
That's when I knew my time was through
Rest in peace were the last words he said
Well, all the people were runnin' jumpin'
even thumpin' on my bad neighbours' door
Cryin' Curly Billy silly with his Colt he calls Filly
Let me in I got to hide
Well ev'rybody was cryin', sighin' Sam Magee's dyin'
No-one to protect our town
Curly Billy's silly with his Colt he calls Filly
He's gonna shoot the sheriff down
