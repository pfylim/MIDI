(Words & music: A.Holten/L.Laverman/N.Manenkei)

Follow me, follow me
It's a beautiful day
(Sing a song for the children)
Trust in me, lean on me
Life is true, bright and gay
Follow me, trust in me
Fantasy, let it be
(Let it be, let it be)

Chorus:
Now hold on and sing
(Hold on and sing)
A song for the children
(Sing a song for the children)
Be nice and be in
(Be nice and be in)
Be good for the children
(it's so good for the children)
Let harmony stay, lets pray
Let's pray for the children
(We will stay and pray together)
When plans for tomorrow
Yes, I'm gonna tell you
Tell the truth of the day
Follow me, trust in me
Follow me, lean on me
(La la la la etc.)

Some are black, some stay white
Is it wrong or is it right
(Tell it all to the children)
Feeling strong, feeling light
Every day and every night
Follow me, sing along
Follow me, ride along
(Ride along, ride along)

Chorus: ...2x...
