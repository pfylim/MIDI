  Aquarius/Let The Sunshine In - Hair
  
  When the moon is in the seventh house
  And Jupiter aligns with Mars
  Then peace will guide the planets
  And love will steer the stars
  This is the dawning of the age of acquarius
  Age of acquarius
  Acquarius acquarius
  Harmony and understanding
  Sympathy and trust abounding
  No one falls along derisions
  Golden living dreams and visions
  (Mystic crystal revelation)
  And the mind's true liberation
  Acquarius acquarius.
