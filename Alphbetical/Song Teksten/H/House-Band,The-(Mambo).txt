Title  : THE MAMBO

(Words & music: Smid/Hardholt/Klaasse)

Goin' down to New Orleans
Well I'm gonna see the Zulu Queen
Eatin' filet-gumbo
And doin' that mardi gras mambo
Hey hey hey jockomo fino anand‚
(Singin' on a mardi gras morning)
Hear the voices hummin'
'Cause the Indians are comin'
Listen what the spy-boy say
He say two-way-pocky-way
Hey hey hey (get together in New Orleans)
Hey hey hey jockomo fino anand‚
Longhair's gonna be in town
Four hair combo shake 'em down
Dr. John will be there too
So desitively bonnaroo
Hey hey hey (listen to the big chief callin')
Hey hey hey (jockomo fino anah‚)
Hey hey hey (sinin' in mardi gras morning)
Hey hey hey (jockomo fino anah‚)
Hey hey hey (can't you hear the spy-boy callin')
Hey hey hey (jockomo fino anah‚)
