   The Last Waltz      Engelbert Humperdinck


I wonder should I go  or should I stay
and it's only one more song to play
then I saw you at the corner of my eyes
a little girl  alone and  so shy

I had the last waltz with you
two lonely people together
I felt in love with you
the last waltz  should last  forever

But the luck we had  was going strong
through the good and bad we get along
then the flame of love  died in your eyes
my heart was broken two  when you said good-bye

I had the last waltz with you ...

It's all over now
nothing left to say
just my tears and all gasper playing
lalalala....

I had the last waltz with you ...

I had the last waltz with you ...
