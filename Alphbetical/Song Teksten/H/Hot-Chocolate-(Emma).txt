Singer : HOT CHOCOLATE 
Title  : EMMA

We were together since we were five
She was so pretty Emma was a star in ev'ryone's eyes
And when she said she'd be a movie queen
Nobody laughed
Her face like an angel, she could be anything

Emily, Emma, Emily
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emily, Emma, Emily I'm gonna
make you the biggest star this world have ever seen

At seventeen we were wed
And worked day and night to earn our daily bread
And ev'ry day Emma would go out searching for that play
That never ever came her way

You know sometimes she'd come home
So depressed I'd hear her crying in the back room
Feel so distressed
And I'd remember back when she was five
To the words that used to make Emily come alive

(It was) Emily, Emma, Emily
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen
Emily, Emma, Emily I'm gonna
make you the biggest star this world have ever seen

It was a cold and dark decembernight
When I opened up the bedroom door
To find her lying still and cold up on the bed
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor
It read:
Darling, I love you but I just can't keep on
living on dreams no more
I tried so very hard not to leave you along
I just can't keep on tryin' no more
