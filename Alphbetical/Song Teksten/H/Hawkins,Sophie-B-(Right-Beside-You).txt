I'm dancing in the shadows
Life and death is all around me
Tonight I miss you making love to me
Right beside myself I'm holding you tight
Someone is waiting for me to rise and
Dive into the ocean
I cried and I cried and I cried my baby to sleep
This time myself my soul will keep
Right beside you my secret
Right beside you I'll stay
Right beside you I'll be
Right beside you always.

We're dancing in the shade of the summer sun
The drums are playing
The change to come was yesterday
In the heat beside myself
I'll need to keep
Right beside you
I feel right beside you
I am right beside you
I kneel right beside you
I stand right beside you
I see right beside you
I stay right beside you
I'll be right beside you always.

Drive into town and top down something
You're moored to the water
I could be your speed and
One hand on the wheel
One hand on the knee
I could tell you what you want
You can tell me what you need
Done a lot to get queer on the city
So close is a question
There is a lot around
But I am close
Will arrive there
I'm just a little base
Not a matter of style
It's just not my taste
I remember when I was a child
You made me hope to be another
Now I'm saving life beside me
All the people still exist
I don't pretend to love the man
But Johnny when you drive me
Away and I lose my friends.

Right beside you
I feel right beside you
I am right beside you
I kneel right beside you
I stand right beside you
I see right beside you
I stay right beside you
I'll be right beside you.

Always right beside you
I feel right beside you
I am right beside you
I kneel right beside you
I stand right beside you
I see right beside you
I stay right beside you
I'll be right beside you always.
I stay right beside you
I'll be right beside you always.
