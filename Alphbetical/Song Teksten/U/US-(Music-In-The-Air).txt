Title  : MUSIC IN THE AIR

It's no use being sad my dear
There's no need to be down
Your happiness is always near
You've got to look around
And when the sky is overcast
Just realize that it won't last

Refrain:
There's music in the air
Just try to listen
Open your ears
You'll hear it everywhere
And music's in the air
It always will be there

The birds are singing in the sky
You feel a tender breeze
It's such a foolish thing to cry
Today there's only peace
Why don't you smile, your tears are gone
Feel free a while and there's a song

Refrain: ...

So concentrate upon the sun
This light will last a day
Just feel the warmth why should you run
Why should you go away
Now stay with us and use your eyes
We're all together in paradise

Refrain: ...
