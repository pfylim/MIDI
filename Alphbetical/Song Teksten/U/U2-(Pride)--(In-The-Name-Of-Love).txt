Title  : Pride (In The Name Of Love)
Singer : U2


One man come in the name of love
One man come and go
One man come he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love
What more in the name of love

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resist
One man washed up on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love
What more in the name of love

Early morning April 4
A shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took his life
They could not take his pride

In the name of love
One more in the name of love
