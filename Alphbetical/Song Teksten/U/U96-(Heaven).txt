6. HEAVEN - U 96

Feels like in heaven.
Feels like in heaven.

Chorus 2x
Call it love, call it sin
It`s the state I`m in.
Feels like in heaven.
I am blessed and obsessed
Beautious angels
Feels like in heaven.

Heaven, heaven
Wonders, wonders
Angels, angels
Angels, angels

This gate shuts the way 
To forbidden fruit
Feels like in heaven.
To marry to have it 
To melt an emotion
Feels like in heaven.

Chorus

Heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven

Feels like in heaven.
Feels like in heaven.

Chorus

Heaven, heaven

Feels like in heaven.
Heaven
Angels, angels
Angels, angels

Chorus

Call it love, feels like in heaven.
Call it sin, feels like in heaven.

To love is to fear his poison kiss.
Feels like in heaven.
Take good care what you are
Stronger than ever
Feels like in heaven

Heaven, heaven
Heaven, heaven
