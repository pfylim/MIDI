Title  : Everlasting Love
Singer : U2


Hearts gone astray
Deep in hurt when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so
You won't regret
I'll come back beggin' you
Won't you forget ?
Welcome love we once knew

Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl to be my pride
You'll never de denied
Everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be elected part of everlasting love
Need a love to last forever
Need a love to last forever

Where life really flows
No one really knows
Till someone's there to show
The way to lasting love
Like the sun shine
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine Whiteternal love
Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own everlasting love
Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong
We'd have our very own everlasting love
