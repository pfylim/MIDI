Title  : Kingston Town
Singer : UB40


The night seems to fade
But the moonlight lingers on
There are wonders for everyone
Wooh...

The stars shine so bright
But they're fading after dawn
There is magic in Kingston Town

Oh Kingston Town, the place I long to be
If I had all the world,
I would give it away just to see the girls and play...

When I am king, surely I will need a queen
And a palace and everything 
Yeah yeah...

And now I am king and my queen will come at dawn
She'll be waiting in Kingston Town

She'll be waiting in Kingston Town...
