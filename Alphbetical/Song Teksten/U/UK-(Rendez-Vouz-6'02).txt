Title  : RENDEZ-VOUS 602

(Words & music: Jobson/Wetton)

It's five o'clock
Driving down Park Lane
As London leaves for the weekend again
Through the dark city streets
In the clinging rain
I took my car towards the Thames and Waterloo

Chorus:
Rendez-vous 6:02
Rendez-vous 6:02

Was that a face I saw?
No, just a trick of light
It's getting clearer now, moving out of sight
I can't miss that train
I turn around, walk through the arch of Waterloo

Chorus: ...

I saw that same hooded face
He beckoned me from the gate
Did you not know, my friend?
Ten years ago was the end
After the war, Waterloo was no more
But your ticket states, there is one train
It's leaving now and there is a place
Remember my face and Waterloo

Chorus: ...
