UB 40 & CHRISSIE HYNDE - I GOT YOU BABE

They say we're young and we don't know
Won't you find out until we go
Well I don't know babe if that's true
'Cause you got me and baby I got you

Babe, I got you babe (2x)

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's so our money is always spent
I guess that's so we don't have a love
At least I'm sure of all the day's we've got

Babe, I got you babe (2x)

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I say you're a clown
And when I get scared you're always around

So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe, I got you babe (3x)

I've got you to hold my hand
I've got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to walk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight

I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you babe (14x)
