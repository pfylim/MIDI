    Rock me baby         UB 40


Say, say, say 
Rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me out here on the floor.
Come on, rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me til I want no more 

Oh, that sweet, sweet reggae music playin',
The smell of parfume fills the air.
The moon is right, come hold me tight
Oh, let's dance, romance,
While we still have the chance.

Come on, come on
Rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me out here on the floor.
Come on, rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me til I want no more.

There's a feeling of love
Deep inside me, this heart of mine
Is poundering in my brain,
I feel the fire, I feel desire,

Oh, let' dance, romance,
While we sill have the chance

Come on, come on
Rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me out here on the floor.
Come on, rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me til I want no more

And when the night is through,
I will still be here with you,
And the music will go on and on,

Oh yeah baby, come on,
Rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Rock me out here on the floor,
Come on, rock me, rock me, rock me baby,
Oh girl, rock me til I want no more.
