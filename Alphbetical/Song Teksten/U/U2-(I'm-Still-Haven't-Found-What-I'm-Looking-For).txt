Titel:        I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

I have climbed highest mountains,
I have run through the fields
only to be with you, only to be with you.
I have run, I have crawled.
I have scaled these city walls, these city walls,
only to be with you.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

I have kissed honey lips,
felt the healing finger tips,
it burned like fire,
this burnin' desire.
I have spoke with the tounge of angels,
I have held the hand of the devil
it was warm in the night,
I was cold as a stone, mm.
But I still haven't found
what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

I believe, in the Kingdom come,
then all the colours will bleed into one,
bleed into one.
But yes I'm still runnin'.
You broke the bonds, and you loosed the chains,
carry the cross of my shame, of my shame,
you know I believe it.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
