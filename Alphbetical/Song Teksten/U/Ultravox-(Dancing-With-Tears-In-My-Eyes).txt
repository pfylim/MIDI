ULTRAVOX - DANCING WITH TEARS IN MY EYES

Refrain:
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's five (five five five) and I'm driving home again
It's hard (hard hard hard) to believe that it's my last time
The man (man man man) on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

Refrain: ...

It's late (late late) and I'm with my love alone
We drink (we drink we drink) to forget the coming storm
We love (love love love) to the sound of our favorite song
Over and over

Refrain: ...

It's time (time time) and we're in eachother's arms
It's time (time time) but I don't think we really care
(time time time time time time time time)

Refrain: ...

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
