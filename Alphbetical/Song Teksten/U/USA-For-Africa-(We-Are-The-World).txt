U S A  FOR AFRICA - WE ARE THE WORLD

There comes a time when we heed a certain wall
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

Refrain:
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that
someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

Refrain: ...

When you're down and out, there seems no
hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a chance can only come
When we stand together as one

Refrain: ...
