  GO WEST (PET SHOP BOYS)
  
  Together - we will go our way,
  Together - we will leave some day,
  Together - your hand in my hand,
  Together - we will make our plans.
  
  Together - we will fly so high
  Together - tell all our friends goodbye,
  Together - we will start life new,
  Together - this is what we'll do.
  
  Go west - life is peaceful there,
  Go west - in the open air,
  Go west - where the skies are blue,
  Go west - this is what we're gonna do.
  
  Together - we will love the beach,
  Together - we will learn and teach,
  Together - change our pace of life,
  Together - we will work and strive.
  
  I love you - I know you love me,
  I want you - how could I disagree?
  So that's why - I make no protest
  When you say - you will do the rest.
  
  Go west - life is peaceful there,
  Go west - in the open air,
  Go West - baby you and me,
  Go West - this is our destiny.
  
  Go west - sun in wintertime,
  Go west - we will do just fine,
  Go west - where the skies are blue,
  Go west - this is what we're gonna do.
  
  There where the air is free,
  We'll be what we want to be.
  
  Now if we make a stand
  We'll find our promised land.
  
  I know that - there are many ways
  To live there - in the sun or shade,
  Together - we will find a place
  To settle - where there's so much space.
  
  Without rust - and the pace back East
  The hustling - rustling just to feed,
  I know I'm - ready to leave too,
  So that's what - we are gonna do.
  
  We're gonna do
  
  Go west - life is peaceful there.
  Go West - there in the open air.
  Go West - where the skies are blue,
  Go West - this is what we're gonna do.
  
  Go west - life is peaceful there,
  Go west - there in the open air..
  Go west - baby you and me,
  Go west - this is our destiny.
  
  Go west - life in wintertime,
  Go west - there we will feel just fine.
  Go west - where the skies are blue,
  Go west - this is what we're gonna do.
  
  Go west.
