12. There Is A Star - Pharao

Chorus
There is a star
There must be one
Whatever you wish it will be done
And if you believe
The star's always shining
There is a star
There must be one
Whatever you wish it will be done
And if you believe
The star's always shining

Rap 1
Starlight, so bright for a star
I've seen the night
Made me think about life
The meaning is you and me
Myself and I
Can you picture why?
If our mind is strong
Imagine what's going on
Believe in yourself and shine on
Then the meanong is so clear to see
Understand the power
Then the light goes deep (2 times)

Chorus
There is a star ahah, ahah, ahahaha
There is a star ahah, ahah, ahahaha

Rap 2
Just live and go but believe in you
Do what you want
To do with the limits true
Twinkle, twinkle, see the star
Now believe in who you are
'cause what you are is the future
Love and peace
Then everything is clear to see
The starting point is the star
Just believe in who you are

Chorus
There is a star ahah, ahah, ahahaha
There is a star ahah, ahah, ahahaha
There is a star
