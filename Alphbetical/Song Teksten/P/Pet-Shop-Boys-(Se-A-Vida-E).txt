12. SE A VIDA E - PET SHOP BOYS

Come outside and see a brand new day.
The troubles in your mind
Will blow away.
It`s easy to believe
They`re here to stay.
But you won`t find them
Standing in your way.

Refrain
Se a vida ,, I love you.       
Come outside and feel the morning sun.
Se a vida ,, I love you.       
Life is much more simple
When you`re young.
Come on, es a vida ,, 
That`s the way life is,
That`s the way life is.
I always see the world,
Through different eyes.
Share the same ideal of paradise.
So don`t search in the stars,
For signs of love,
Look around your life.
You`ll find the love.
Refrain
Why do you want to sit alone,
In gothic gloom.
Surrounded by the ghosts
Of love that haunt your room.
Somewhere there`s a different door,
To open wide.
You gotta throw those skeletons
Out of your closet,
And come outside.
So you will see, a brand new day.
The troubles in your mind,
Will blow away.
It`s easy to believe
They`re here to stay.
But you won`t find them
Standing in your way.
Refrain
Come on, es a vida ,,
That`s the way life is,
That`s the way life is.
Se a vida ,, I love you.       
Come outside and feel the morning sun.
Se a vida ,, I love you.       
Life is much more simple
When you`re young.
Se a vida ,, I love you.
