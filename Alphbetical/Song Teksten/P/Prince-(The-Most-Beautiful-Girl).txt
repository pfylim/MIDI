  THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL (THE SYMBOL)

  
  COULD U BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
  IT'S PLAIN 2 SEE, U'RE THE REASON THAT GOD MADE A GIRL
  
  WHEN THE DAY TURNS INTO THE LAST DAY OF ALL TIME
  I CAN SAY, I HOPE U ARE IN THESE ARMS OF MINE
  AND WHEN THE NIGHT FALLS BEFORE THAT DAY I WILL CRY
  I WILL CRY TEARS OF JOY CAUSE AFTER U
  ALL ONE CAN DO IS DIE
  
  COULD U BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
  IT'S PLAIN 2 SEE, U'RE THE REASON THAT GOD MADE A GIRL
  
  HOW CAN I GET THROUGH DAYS WHEN I CAN'T GET THROUGH HOURS
  OH NO, I CAN TRY BUT WHEN I DO
  I SEE U AND I'M DEVOURED
  WHO'D ALLOW A FACE 2 BE SOFT AS A FLOWER
  I CAN BOW AND FEEL PROUD IN THE FACE OF THIS POWER
  
  COULD U BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
  IT'S PLAIN 2 SEE, U'RE THE REASON THAT GOD MADE A GIRL
  
  AND IF THE STARS EVER FELL ONE BY ONE FROM THE SKY
  I KNOW MARS COULD NOT BE 2 FAR BEHIND
  CUZ BABY, THIS KIND OF BEAUTY HAS GOT NO REASON 2 BE SHY
  THIS KIND OF BEAUTY IS THE KIND THAT COMES FROM INSIDE
  
  COULD U BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
  IT'S PLAIN 2 SEE, U'RE THE REASON THAT GOD MADE A GIRL
