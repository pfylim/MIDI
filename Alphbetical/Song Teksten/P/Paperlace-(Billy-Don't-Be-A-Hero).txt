Singer : PAPERLACE 
Title  : BILLY DON'T BE A HERO

The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldiers blues feelin' behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line
And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was cryin'
And though her tears I heard her say

Refrain:
Billy don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife
And as Billy started to go
She said keep your pretty head low
Billy don't be a hero come back to me

The soldier blues were tapped on a hillside
The battle ragin' all the sergeant cried
we've got to hang on boys
We gotta hold this piece of ground
I need a volunteer to ride out
And bring me back some extra men
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
forgettin' all the words
She said, she said

Refrain: ...

I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told that Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She could be proud he died that way
I heard she threw ..?..
