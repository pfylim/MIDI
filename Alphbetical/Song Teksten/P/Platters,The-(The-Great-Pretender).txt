Titel:        THE GREAT PRETENDER

Interpret:    THE PLATTERS


Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender,
pretendin' I'm doin' well; 
My need is such, I pretend so much,
I'm lonely but no one can tell.

Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender,
a-drift in a world of my own;
I play the game, but to my real shame,
you've left me to dream all alone.
Too real is this feeling of make believe,
too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal,

Oh, yes, I'm the great pretender,
just laughin' and gay like a clown;
I seem to be what I'm not, you see,
I'm wearin' my heart like a crown;
Pretendin' that youre still aroun'.
