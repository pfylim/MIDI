Titel:            GO, TELL IT TO THE MOUNTAIN

Interpret:        PETER, PAUL & MARY



Go tell it to the mountain
over the hills and evrywhere
go tell it to the mountain
that Jesus christ is aborn.

When I was a seeker,
I sought both night and day.
I asked my Lord to help me
and he taught me to pray.

When I was a sinner
I prayed both night and day.
I asked the LOrd to help me
and he showed me tha way.

While shepheard kept their watching;
o'er wand'ring flock by night;
behold ! From out the heavens,
there shone a holy light.

He made me a watchman
upon the city wall,
and if I am a Christian
I am the least of all

And, lo, when they had seen it,
they all bowed down and prayed;
then travelled on together,
to where the babe was laid.
