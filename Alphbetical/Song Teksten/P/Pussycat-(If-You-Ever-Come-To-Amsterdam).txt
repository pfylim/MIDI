Title  : IF YOU EVER COME TO AMSTERDAM

(Words & music: W.A. Theunissen)

I loved to be with you but now I'm leaving
I really did enjoy each single evening
Moments here with you I will remember
On rainy days that come
Summerlove has left my heart enchanted
It's hard to go away before it ended
With kisses on a mountain
The time has come that we must say goodbye

Chorus:
If you ever come to Amsterdam
I'll be waiting there for you
And I'll show you where young lovers go
On a sunny afternoon
Where the summernights of Amsterdam
Cover flowers at your side
I'll be yours the day we'll meet again
In Amsterdam

I call you every day 'cause when I hear you
I relive the moments I've been near you
I found a four leaf clover
I'd like to send it over
And maybe there's a time we'll meet one day

Chorus: ...
