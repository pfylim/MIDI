Singer : THE PRETENDERS
Title  : TALK OF THE TOWN

(Words & music: Chrissie Hynde)

It's such a drag to want something sometimes
One thing leads to another, I know
There was a time wanted your for mine
Nobody knew

You arrived like a day and passed like a cloud
I made a wish, I said it out loud
Out loud in the crowd

Everybody heard, it was the talk of the town

It's not my place to know what you feel
I'd like toknow, by why should I?
Who were you then, who were you now
Common labourer by night, by day high brow

Back in my room I wonder, then I
Sit on the bed and look at the sky
Oh, up in the sky

Crowds rearrange, like the talk of the town

Ah, but it's hard to live by the rules
I nver could and still never do
But the rules and such never bothered you
You call the shots and they follow

I watch you still from a distance
Back to my room, you'll never know
I want you

I want you now, who's the talk of the town?

Maybe tomorrow, maybe someday? (2x)
You've changed your race in this world (2x)
