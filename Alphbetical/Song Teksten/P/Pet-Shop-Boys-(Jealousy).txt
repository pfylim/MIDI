At dead of night, when strangers roam
The streets in search of anyone
Who'll take them home
I lie alone, the clock strikes three
And anyone who wanted to contact me
At dead of night,'til break of day
Endless thoughts and questions
Keep me away
It's much too late
Where've you been? Who've you seen?
You didn't phone
When you said you would
Do you lie? Do you try
To keep in touch?
You know you could
I've tried
To see your point of view
But could not hear
Or see for jealousy
I never knew time
Pass so slow
I wish I'd never met you 
Or that I could bear
To let you go
--------------------------------------------------------
At dead of night, 'til break of day
Endless thoughts and questions
Keep me away
It's much too late
Where've you been? Who've you seen?
You didn't phone
When you said you would
Do you lie? Do you try
To keep in touch?
You know you could
I've tried
To see your point of view
But could not hear
Or see for jealousy
--------------------------------------------------------
Where've you been?
Who've you seen?
You didn't phone
When you said you would
Do you lie?
Do you try to keep in touch?
You know you could
I've tried to see
Your point of view
But could not hear
Or see for jealousyy
(Repeat three times)
