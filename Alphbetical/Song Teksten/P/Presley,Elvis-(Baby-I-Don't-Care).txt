Interpret:    ELVIS PRESLEY

You don't like crazy music;
You don't like rockin' bands
you just wanna go to a movie show 
and sit there holdin' hands.

You're so square, but baby I don't care.

Aou don't like hot rod racin',
or drivin' late at night.
You just wanna park where it's nice and dark;
You just wanna hold me tight.

You're so square, but baby I don't care.

You don't know any dance steps that are new,
but no one else can love me like you do.
I don't know why my heart flips;
I only know it does.
I wonder why I love you babe,
I guess it's just because 

you're so square, and baby I don't care.
