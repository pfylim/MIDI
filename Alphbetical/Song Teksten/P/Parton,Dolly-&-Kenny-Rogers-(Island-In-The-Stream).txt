  8. ISLAND IN THE STREAM - DOLLY PARTON & K.ROGERS
  
  Baby, when I met you  There was peace on earth
  I set out to get you  With a fine tooth comb
  I was soft inside  There was something going on.
  
  You do something to me That I can't explain
  Hold me closer  And I feel no pain
  Every beat of my heart  We got something going on.
  
  Tender love is blind  It requires a dedication
  All this love we feel  Needs no conversation
  We write it together uh uh  Making love with each other uh uh.
  
  Islands in the stream  That is what we are
  No one in between  How can we be wrong
  Sail away with me  To another world
  And we rely on each other uh uh
  From one lover to another uh uh.
  
  I can't live without you  If the love was gone
  Everything is nothing  If you've got no one
  And you did walk in the night  Losing sight of the real thing.
  
  But that won't happen to us  And we got no doubt
  To deep in loving  We got no way out
  And the message is clear  This could be the year
  For the real thing  No more will you cry
  Baby, I will hurt you never  We start and end as one
  In love forever.
  We can ride it together uh uh
  Making love with each other uh uh
