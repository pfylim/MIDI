MAXI PRIEST - SOME GUYS HAVE ALL THE LUCK

Lonely so lonely in your love yeah
Oh so lonely I can't stand it

Alone in a crowd on a bus after work I'm daydreaming
The guy next to me has his woman on his arms my arms are empty
Ooh how does it feel when the woman that you love
Says yes she loves you
It seems unfair when there's love everywhere
And yet there's none for you

refrain:
Some guys have all the luck
(Some guys have all the luck)
Some guys have all the pain
(Some guys have all the pain)
Some guys have a little sunshine
in their lives
My life is always filled with rain

Someone to take on a walk down
by the lake dear Lord let her be
Someone to shout someone who
is liable to cry at sad movies ooh
I do believe I will die just to look in her eyes
And find it's filled with me
Oh but you're just a dream and as real as it seems
I'm not that lucky

refrain: ...

Woh it's just a losing game
Things have got to change
(have got to change)
Some girl will give my love a try
With my love their arms
will open wide

refrain: ...
