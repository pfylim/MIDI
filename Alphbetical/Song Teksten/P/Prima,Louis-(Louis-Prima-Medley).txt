Iïm just a gigolo,
And everywhere I go,
People know the part Iïm playing.
Payed for every dance,
Selling his romance,
Oh, what theyïre saying.

There will come a day,
And youth will pass away,
What will they say about me?
When the end comes I know,
Thereïs just a gigolo,
Life goes on without me.

Everywhere I go,
People know the part Iïm playing.
Payed for every dance,
Selling huge romance,
Oh, what theyïre saying.

And there will come a day,
And youth will pass away,
What will they say about me?
When the end comes I know,
Thereïs just a gigolo,
Life goes on without me.
