Title  : DON'T STAND SO CLOSE TO ME
Artist : THE POLICE

(Words & music: Sting)

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirls fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Chorus:
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teachers pet
Temptations, frustrations
So bad it makes him cry
The busstop she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Chorus: ...2x...

Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
So strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man
In the book of Nabokov

Chorus: ...
