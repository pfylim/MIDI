Singer : POINTER SISTERS 
Title  : HAPPINESS

(Words & music: Allen Toussaint)

I love the way you love to live
You love life, you're inspiration
I love the way that you give
Your heart so freely
You're a sweet sensation
You're my invitation to happiness
You fill my heart's desire
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming

I love the way you watch the world
Through kind eyes, that's why you're
Never sad, sad
Things don't bother you like do's
don'ts or why's
You hold on the good and you let
The bad go by

Yeah, yeah happiness
I want your love forever
Happiness
Give me your love forever
More, more, more and more
And over and over again
Keep that goodness coming

Happiness, give me your love forever
Happiness, say you'll leave me never
More, more and more, and over
And over again
Keep that goodness coming
