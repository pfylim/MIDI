Title  : YOU MAKE IT ALRIGHT

(Words & music: K. Cheetz/J. Orleans)

Jacques:
Soft as a summer breath goes by
Gently you come to me
And I reach for your hand
And see your smile

Patricia:
Just like a candle in the night
You give my life
A glowing light
When you are near

Chorus:
Stars shine in your eyes
There's no disguise
For all the love
That you bring to me
You show me the way
You make my day
And you make my night
You make it alright

Jacques:
You help me up each time I fall
You're always there
If I should call
Easen my pain
Sothing my mind

Patricia:
You keep me warm when I'm cold
You know the secrets of my soul
I want you near

Chorus: ...

Jacques:
You show me the way, baby

Patricia:
You make my day

Together:
You make my night
You make it alright
