POINTER SISTERS - I'M SO EXCITED


Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're going for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

Refrain:
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know
I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long time
We'll have a good time baby don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around boy
That's just fine

Refrain: ...

Let's get excited
We just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
And I know I know I know
I know I want you

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow I'll let it go

Refrain: ...

I'm so excited (Look what you do to me)
And I just can't hide it (You got me burnin' up)
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
(oh oh wow)
