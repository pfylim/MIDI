THE POWER STATION - SOME LIKE IT HOT

We want to multiply, are you gonna do it?
I know we qualify, are you gonna do it?
Don't be so circumscribe, are you gonna do it?
Just get yourself untied, are you gonna do it?
Feel the heat, pushing you to decide
Feel the heat, burning you up, ready or not

Refrain:
Some like it hot and some sweat when the heat is on
Some feel the heat and decide that they can't go on
Some like it hot, but you can't tell how hot till you try
Some like it hot, so let's turn up the heat till we fry

The girl is at your side, are you gonna do it?
She wants to be your bride, are you gonna do it?
She wants to multiply, are you gonna do it?
I know you won't be satisfied until you do it!
Feel the heat, pushing you to decide
Feel the heat, burning you up, ready or not
Some like it hot and some sweat when the heat is on
Some like it hot, some like it hot
Feel the heat, pushing you to decide
Feel the heat, burning you up, ready or not

Refrain: ...

Some like it hot, some like it hot
Some like it hot, some like it hot
