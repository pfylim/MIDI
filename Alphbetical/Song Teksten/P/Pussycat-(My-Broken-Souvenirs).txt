Title  : MY BROKEN SOUVENIRS

(Words & music: Werner Theunissen)

For each moment of tears
I still had my souvenirs
Cherished in a pocketful of dreams
I could hold, I could feel
Kept pretending they were real
Long time after lovers stayed away

Now a picture of you
I had cherished so true
Even kissed till I'd seen you again, but when

I've been crying today
Threw my memories away
Something died as cried for my broken souvenirs
Can I reach for the sun
Find a place I belong
Now you're one of my broken souvenirs
Now you're one of my broken souvenirs
Baby, you're one of my broken souvenirs

If you need me again
There's no way you really can
Pasted pieces never make a whole
And if you leave your room
On some windy afternoon
Try to see where all the pieces flew
It was hard to get on
Since my memories were gone
But if you'll ever see me again, I can
