Title  : EVERLASTING LOVE

(Words & music: Buzz Cason/Mac Gayden)

Hearts gone astray
Deep in hurt when they go
I went away
Just when you needed me so

Chorus:
Open up your eyes
Then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side
Girl to be my pride
You'll never denied everlasting love
From the very start
Open up your heart
Be elected part of everlasting love
(Need a love to last forever,
Need a love to last forever)

You won't regret
I'll come back beggin' you
Won't you forget
Welcome love we once knew

Chorus: ...

Where life really flows
No one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun it shines
Endlessly it shines
You always will be mine
With eternal love
Whenever love went wrong
Ours would still be strong (2x)
We'd have our very own everlasting love
