
7. Mississippi - Pussycat

Where you can hear a country song from far
And someone play the honky tonk guitar
Where all the lights will go out one by one
The people join the song
And the wind takes it away.

Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
And lovers found the place they like to be
How many times before the song was ending
Love and understanding everywhere around.

CHORUS:
Mississippi
I'll remember you 
Whenever I should go away
I'll be longing for the day
That I will be in Greenville again.

Mississippi
You'll be on my mind
Every time I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time.

Now the country song forever has lost its soul
When the guitar play I turn to rock 'n roll
And every time when summer nights are falling
I always will be calling dreams of yesterday.

CHORUS:

Every time I hear this song
Mississippi roll along
Until the end of time.
