No milk and honey but troubles a lot
this is how we were living
and it's all that we got.

I'll always remember the words from my dad
when he took me to bed. He said:

Scotty Boy, remember this,
Scotty Boy, today you're a little boy
but you're gonna find your way
Scotty Boy, remember this,
Scotty Boy, the sun shines for every boy
that's all I can say.

Singin' and laughin' were making me strong
like a song that would raise me
when the whole world went wrong.
Seasons are changing and years pass away,
but there's something that tells me
carry on come what may, he said:

Scotty Boy, remember this,...
