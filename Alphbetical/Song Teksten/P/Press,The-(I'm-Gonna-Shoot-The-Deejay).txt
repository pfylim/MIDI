Title  : I'M GONNA SHOOT THE DEEJAY
Artist : THE PRESS

(Words & music: Walter Nita)

Chorus:
I'm gonna shoot the deejay
'Cause he won't play my tune
I'm gonna shoot the deejay
'Cause he won't play my tune
I know I'll never make it
Though I try hard to take it
I know I'll never make it
Though I try hard to take it
I'm gonna shoot the deejay
'Cause he won't play my tune
I'm gonna shoot the deejay
'Cause he won't play my tune

Well it started with a two track
And a whole lot of fun
And all our friends and family
Adored what we had done
But we couldn't manage to get some airplay
Not even on the locals
Some stupid guy who came to me
And said I blame it on the vocals

Chorus: ...

So now we bought a studio, 24-track, very fine
Recorded all the instruments on a different line
Now we've got seven engineers
And the world's best producer
Recorded a gorgeous 12-inch dub
And still he just won't use her

Well I thomp him in the belly and I kick him on the head
I spit him in the face and I bite him in the nose
I'm gonna shoot the deejay
Wait till I get my hands on you, sucker
You know what I'm gonna do
Yeah, man, it's true: this man's been ruining
My career for the last five years
Yeah, you better really be prepared, buddy
'Cause I'm gonna get ya
You've been warned
