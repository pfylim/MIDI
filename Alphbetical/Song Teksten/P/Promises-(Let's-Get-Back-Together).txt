I can't remember the reasons why
it doesen't matter anyhow,
you went your way
and I went mine.

Ev'rytime I get the chance
I reminisce about the past romance
baby, your name always seems to pop
I can't remember anything bad,
only the good times that we had, og sugar,
let's get back together
don't you know time is the doctor,
love is the benefactor, oh sugar,
let's get back together.

Be together all I ask
no time payments and no risk
you'll have your way
and I'll have mine.

Ev'ry time I get the chance,...
