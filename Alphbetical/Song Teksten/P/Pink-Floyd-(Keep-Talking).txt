  7. KEEP TALKING - PINK FLOYD
  
  (GESPROCHEN)
  FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS MANKIND LIVED JUST LIKE THE ANIMALS
  THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED WHICH UNLEASHED
  THE POWER OF OUR IMAGINATION
  WE LEARNED TO TALK
  
  (GESANG)
  THERE'S A SILENCE SURROUNDING ME
  I CAN'T SEEM TO THINK STRAIGHT
  I'LL SIT IN THE CORNER
  NO ONE CAN BOTHER ME
  
  I THINK I SHOULD
  SPEAK NOW: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME
  
  I CAN'T SEEM TO
  SPEAK NOW: (CHOR ANTWORT) YOU NEVER TALK TO ME
  
  MY WORDS WON'T
  COME OUT RIGHT: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
  
  I FEEL LIKE
  I'M DROWNING: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHAT ARE YOU FEELING
  
  I'M FEELING WEAK NOW: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME
  
  BUT I CAN'T
  SHOW MY WEAKNESS: (CHOR ANTWORT) YOU NEVER TALK TO ME
  
  I SOMETIMES WONDER: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHAT ARE YOU THINKING
  
  WHERE DO WE GO
  FROM HERE: (CHOR ANTWORT) WHAT ARE YOU FEELING
  
  (GESPROCHEN)
  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A LIKE THIS
  ALL WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE WE KEEP TALKING

  (CHOR) WHAT ARE YOU THINKING: (ANTWORT) WE'RE GOING NOWHERE
  
  (CHOR) WHAT ARE YOU FEELING: (ANTWORT) WE'RE GOING NOWHERE
