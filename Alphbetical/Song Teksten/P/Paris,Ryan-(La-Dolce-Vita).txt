            Dolce vita             Ryan Paris


We are walkin' like in a dolce vita, This time we got it right.
We are living like in a dolce vita - gonna dream tonight.

We are dancing like in a dolce vita
With lights and music on, Our love is made in the dolce vita - nobody else than you.

It's all last night togeher with our love again.
Another light before we'll drown in darkness
Say you'll never leave me now, say you gonna love me now.

We made it down in the dolce vita, Wipe all your fears away.
We lived it like in the dolce vita - a game of yesterday.

I'm so alone in the dolce vita, oh baby, telephone.
This magic's gone in the dolce vita, nobody else than you.

It's all last night together with our love again....
It's all last night together with our love again....

We are living like in a dolce vita - gonna dream tonight.
We are dancing like in a dolce vita - nobody else than you.

It's all last night together with our love again....
It's all last night together with our love again....
