DON'T BE CRUEL - ELVIS PRESLEY


You know I can't be fine
Sitting all alone
If you can't come arround
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

Baby you've made you mad
For something I might have said
Please forget my past
The future looks bright ahead
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

And I want no other love
Baby it's still you I'm thinking of
Mm, Mm

Don't stop thinking of me
You know I want you to say it
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Why should we be apart?
I really love you baby, cross my heart

Let's walk up to the preacher
And let us say I do
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true

And I want no other love
Oh baby it's still you I'm thinking of
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
And I want no other love
Oh baby it's still you I'm thinking of.
