Title  : WITH YOU I'M BORN AGAIN

(Words & music: Carol Connors)

Come, bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness
Woman don't you know, with you I'm born again
Come, give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there's no weakness
Lyin' safe within your arms I'm born again

I was half not one
Instead with none
Reaching through this world in need of one

Come, show me your kindness
In your arms I'll know I'll find it
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again

Chorus:
I wa half not one
Instead with none

Come show me your kindness
In your arms I'll know I'll find it
Woman don't you know with you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again
