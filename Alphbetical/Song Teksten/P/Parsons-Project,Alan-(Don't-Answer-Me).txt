3. DON'T ANSWER ME - ALAN PARSONS PROJECT

Intro

Vers 1:
If you believe in the power of magic
I can change your mind
And if you need to believe in someone
Turn and look behind 
When we were  living in a dream world
Clouds got in the way
We gave it up in a moment of madness
And threw it all away

Refrain:  
Don't answer me, don't break the silence, don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island, don't let me in
Run away and hide from ev'ryone
Can you change the things we've said an done ?

Vers 2:
If you believe in the power of magic
It's all a fantasy
So if you need to believe in someone
Just pretend it's me
It ain't enough that we meet as strangers
I can't set you free
So will you  turn your back forever
On what you mean to me ?

Refrain:
Don't answer me, don't break the silence, don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island, don't let me in
Run away and hide from ev'ryone
Can you change the things we've said and done ?

Saxophon-Solo:
 
Refrain: 
Don't answer me, don't break the silence, don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island, don't let me in
Run away and hide from ev'ryone
Don't answer me, don't break the silence, don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island, don't let me in
Can you change the things we've said an done ?
Don't answer me,
