PATTY AND SHIFT - WONDERFUL 

Indecisive, move about 
Secret lovers looking ou 
Lonely people, hiding in the street 
Suddenly I see you turn 
You lift your eyes and then I learn 
That both of us have feelings of defeat 
 
And now that I'm in love 
I think it's lasting 
And now that I'm in love 
You're where I'm at 
There's no one in the world 
It's you I'm asking 
 
Because you're wonderful, just wonderful 
Irresistible and hard to forget 
 
Strike a light, my life lit up 
My fingers tremble, don't ever stop 
Reciprocating questions in the eyes 
I'm wide awake, I wonder why 
Is this for real, or just a lie 
Don't you know I'll be the one that cries 
 
Is it for certain, or will I just die 
Please let it be forever 
 
Make me believe, our love is alive 
This is too good to sever
