Title  : NEW YOUR SHUFFLE

(Words & music: Graham Parker)

Manhattan baby with the sing-song voice
She got a place in the human zoo
Went to live down on the boulevard
Now that the revolution's due
She said I been around from town to town
And I learned to love and hate
But time don't change none for you and me baby
Just get herded through that gate

Chorus:
And do the New York shuffle baby
New York scuffly lean to stay awake all night
We do the New York shuffle baby
New York scuffly get yourself uptight
Get uptight

Now stick around kids you're gonna see some
Action they'll be shooting in the streets
Grab a gun before the police came 
Don't tell me you're to sweet
Down in the alley they're hitting hard
And I'm as blown as the lord can be
They're burnin' flags here and dressin' in drag
Her man it sure is sight to see

Chorus: ...

Mr. Mayor gimme the key let me lock you up
Throw that key down the deepest subway
In New York, New York

I had a primal scream I had a 'lectric dream
I had to bang my head against the ground
I got to get out quick before I get as sic
As the people livin' in this town
Bounce me off the pavement bounce me off the wall
Bounce me off the taxi cars
Gimme a shot of that old Jack Daniel
And put me behind bars

Chorus: ...2x...
