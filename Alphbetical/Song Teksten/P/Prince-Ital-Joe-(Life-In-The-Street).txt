Hey yeah I know what you're thinking
This is Janie Jackson type of singing
But it ain't about that
This is the real, the street life trauma
And you know I grew up rough in the streets of Boston,
Massachusetts lived real ruthless
A wild kid out to get a bit
Did some shit that he never should have did
But he paid the price lived real ....
Ruined his life and lived by the knife
Had to learn the hard way but some day you gotta pay
So what the hell you say

Life in the streets isn't easy
All I see is the inner misery
I kneel there and pray for the future
Strength and protection to survive in this society

This is life in the streets
And that's how we live it
This is life in the streets  This is the way we live our lives
And that's how we live it

Hard and mean at sixteen
Living like a bean and a fiend
I was seen before the Queen
Quick to kill like you still
I'll make your blood spill
I cut your throat for your ghost down coke
'Cause it takes to show
Kids with no go
Ain't got no chance
Got no where to go
That's why life on the streets
Is like a trial full of heat
It will hacker with your head
'Till you're dead on the country

Life in the streets is a mystery
Don't know my friends from my enemies
Often there could be trouble
But I'll hold on tight and
I will never never give up the fight

This is life in the streets
and that's how we live it   This is how we live our life

This is life in the streets    Life on the streets, yeah
And that's how we live it   We're gonna live, we're gonna live our life

This is life in the streets    Life in the streets, yeah
And that's how we live it   This one is dedicated to all the poor black people

This is life in the streets    To every youth that's growing up on the streets
you know
And that's how we live it   We're living for a dream one day

This is life in the streets     And there'll be no more homeless people in the
world
And that's how we live it    This is how we live our life

This is life in the streets
And that's how we live it    Life on the streets is not easy

This is life in the streets
And that's how we live it

This is life in the street
And that's how we live it.
