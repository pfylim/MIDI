Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night

Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Chorus:
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne, you don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne, put on the red light
Roxanne, put on the red light
Roxanne, put on the red light
Roxanne, put on the red light

I loved ya since I knew ya
I wouldn't talk down to ya
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your make-up
Told you once, I won't tell you again
It's a crime the way you

Chorus: ...
