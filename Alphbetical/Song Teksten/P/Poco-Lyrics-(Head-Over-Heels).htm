(Timothy B. Schmit)

I've been thinkin' 'bout
All the times you told me
You're so ful of doubt
You just can't let it be
But I know
If you keep comin' back for more
Then I'll keep on tryin'
Keep on tryin'

And I've been drinkin' now 
Just a little too much
And I don't know how
I can get in touch with you
Now there's only one thing
	for me to do, that's to
To get home to you

And I feel so satiesfied when
I can see you smile
I want to confide in
All that is true, so I'll
Keep on tryin' I'm
Through with lyin'
Just like the sun above
I'll come shinin, trough
Oh yes I'll
Keep on tryin', I'm
Tired of cryin'
I got to find a way
To get on home to you

I've been thingin' 'bout
All the times you held me
I never heard you shout
The flow of energy was so fine
Now I think I'll lay it on the line
And keep on tryin'
To get home to you

And I feel so satiesfied when
I can see you smile
I want to confide in
All that is true, so I'll
Keep on tryin' I'm
Through with lyin'
Just like the sun above
I'll come shinin, trough
Yes I will
Oh yes I'll
Keep on tryin', I'm
Tired of cryin'
I got to find a way
To get on home to you

<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

Seems to me I'm fallin'
And I can't believe my eyes
Don't you know it's love I'm
Tryin' to disguise

But I must confess that
No one else but you
Satiesfies my mind so
What else can I do?

Here I go fallin' in love
Just knowin' that you'll always care
Your lovin' arms
Will hold me there

Spent some time in learnin'
Run from what you feel
Now you got me stumblin'
head over heels

Plain to see it's trouble
Yellin' what to do
Sneakin' up on me and
All because of you.

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

I don't know you but I can feel you
In all the ways you get through these days
Bluer than blue
You're throwin' your dreams up
they all come fallin' down
Then you turn away It's another day
And it seems you're earthly bound

There is doubt in your eyes in ehat you say
And what you want to do
I want to be a surprise can you see it
In my eyes, oh
Let me turn back to you

Out in the light of the dark
There is always left a spark
And would it be all right
Can I see you tonight?
Oh let me turn back to you

I never questioned a smile
Only lasting for a while
Someone must play the fool
If there's a fire in your heart
Then it's time for us to start
Let me turn back to you

Out in the light of the dark
There is always left a spark
And would it be all right
Can I see you tonight?
Oh let me turn back to you
Let me turn back to you
Oh let me turn back to you
Let me turn back to you.

(Rusty Young)

I wish I could say
All my fears fall away
With the sands in the hourglass
But you know it ain't so

I'm holdin' on tight
'Cause I know when it's right
There'll be a woman
Burnin' in my soul

Don't you know I can feel it
Feel it deep inside
Pretty soon you'll find it
Sowin' in my eyes

I can't help from feelin'
You and I were meant for makin' love

You're on my mind
And it seems that I'm
Thinkin' of moments
Alone with you

Hard as it seems
You can see what it means
Woman you know I'm
Losin' my heart

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Down in the quarterpast anybody's bedtime
Anybody anywhere who was halfway out his mind
I was sittin' in a Rock and roll bar
Down from another
Just on up the line
I was talkin' with a new found friend
Who lived his life
On river time

He was holdin' my attention I could
Almost hear the sound
How he ran on the Mississippi on a tug
From the up and down
He was rollin' like the river he could have
Gone on night and day
But I caught myself in midturn and I
Never looked away and

Could it ever happen again
Time awaiting the answer then
Lost and found in the city, New Orleans

Questions in her dark eyes I felt
She already knew
The answers bringing no surprise
Like a Spanish moon
She was grown up on the music
I could only hear at home
When she spoke on of the song I sang
And how it made her feel
So much less alone
Pickin' out the pictures that the tune
Brought in to mind
How it came to me that all along the song was
Her for all time

Could it ever happen again
Time awaiting the answer then
Down in the quarter, New Orleans
Down in the quarter, New Orleans
Down in the quarter, New Orleans
Down in the quarter, New Orleans

<PRE>
(Rusty Young)

What is it gonna be?
When the dust has settled
Will you clearly see
Down the road you're
Driftin; lost and caught in confusion

Waitin' for the day
You won't have to choose
Who can have their way
Without taking sides or
Goin', feelin' so bad

C'mon and take a stand
'Cause you're sure to fall
Sittin' on a fence
Don't you sit on a fence

Where should you begin?
Lookin' for an answer
How can you give in
When worry has you
Wishin', hopin', sayin' you don't know

Now it's up to you
Stand on what you feel or
Fall if you should lose
Nothin's ever certain
To last, in the long run

I been thinkin' 'bout a place
Like a dream that tries to show
Can you see it in my face
That it's time again to go

When I hear her callin' me
From a one way track
Then I got to go and see
What it is that brings me back

Oh, Georgia, I'm just a stray
Won't you shine on my way
I can see it ther in your diamond eyes
When you hold me where your beauty lies
Oh, Georgia , please, I'm down to my knees
Won't you bind my ties
Won't you bind my ties

Everybody's gone away
They're all leaving town
And I'm movin' on to say
I'm through kickin' my heart around
Yes, it's all over now
Crazy things in my head
Have to stay together somehow
For I've got the dream again

Oh, Georgia, I'm just a stray
Won't you shine on my way
I can see it ther in your diamond eyes
When you hold me where your beauty lies
Oh, Georgia , please, I'm down to my knees
Won't you bind my ties
Won't you bind my ties

Silence is all we have
Between us
To see us
Through the night

Make believe, just pretend
We'll always
And always
Have love

And when the time
Has come for us
To speak our peace
Will there be nothin' left for us
But memories

Or will we make
The same mistakes
We made before
But just go on pretendin' that there's
Nothin' more

And make believe, just pretend
We'll always
And always
Have love

<PRE>
(Text: Timothy B. Schmit)
(Music: John Brennan & Timothy B. Schmit)

No, no
Please don't go
Take it easy
Move it slow
Yeah, yeah
Say it ain't so
I got the feelin'
You want me no more
And you say
You've got to run away
Everyday
You think you'll find your way
But it's OK
'Til you find out you've been flyin' solo

No, no
Don't go below
Rise above it
Let it flow
Yeah, yeah
There are seeds you must sow
Grab ahold and don't let go
Take the key
And unlock the door
What's that you see
Another corridor
And there's much more
'Til you find out you've been flyin' solo
Solo.
Have you ever been dreamin'
'Bout the way it could have been
Then you wake up disbelievin'
It's a sin
Oh, but then
You're flyin' solo

Solo
So much to know
Feel the rhythm
Head to toe
I know
We all must grow
But raise the curtain
Before the show
Do you feel
You've been mesmerized
Makin' a deal
To free you from your ties
It's all right
'Til you find out you've been flyin' solo

Solo

Solo

<PRE>
(Donald Fagen & Walter Becker)

I lived in no holy house but the Grand Hotel
The back streets of this old town I know so well.
And I drunk of no holy wine save muscatel;
Now my friend , I've got to go,
You tell everyone I know

I'm sayin' goodbye, bye, bye, Dallas;
I can't stay.
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Bye, bye, Dallas; got to go
And I remember when they told me so.

Right now I'm wonderin' where
the good times have gone;
All the things I never loved when they wwas mine.
Hot city and an empty pocket make a man think on;
I've been living low so long,
Gotta get back where I belong.

I'm sayin' goodbye, bye, bye, Dallas;
I can't stay.
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday
Bye, bye, Dallas; got to go
And I remember when they told me so.

Bye, bye, Dallas;
I can't stay.
Should have been at the palace
Yesterday.
Ain't no bother; it's understood
Livin' under cover don't do no good.
Bye, bye, Dallas.

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

I picked up my things and I said goodbye
Mmmm, I did it with such a sigh
Walked outside, tirned my eyes to the window pane
Yeah, saw you smilin' face once again
I ain't never felt like this before
Like a soldier goin' off to war
And I knew I had to come back for more
And I said

I'll be back again
Yes, I will
Sure can't say just when
But I know
I'll be back again
Back to be with a new friend
I can't believe it's the end.

I'm makin' my way back to L.A. town
I'm not sure if I feel up or down
There you stand, hand in hand,waiting patiently
I wonder if you'll smile on me
I ain't never felt like this before
Like a soldier comin' home from war
But soon I'll have to walk out the door
And I'll say

I'll be back again . . . mmm
Sure can't say just when
But I know
I'll be back again
Back to be with a new friend
I can't believe it's the end.

Everytime I see you I just can't believe my eyes
And It would come as no surprise
If I was fillin' my head full of lies

I'll be back again
Yes I will
Sure can't say just when
But I know
I'll be back again
Back to be with a new friend
Here I come
I'll be back again
