PRINCE - I WOULD DIE FOR YOU

I'm not a woman I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you never lie
If you're evil I'll forgive you by & by
You, I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You I would die for you

I'm not your lover I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry no need to cry
I'm your Messiah and you're the reason why
'cause
You I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You I would die for you

You're just a sinner I am told
I'll be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not human I'm a dove
I am your conscience I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe
That I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You I would die for you

Yeah say one more time
You I would die for you
Darling if you want me to
You I would die for you
I would die for you
You I would die for you (3x)
