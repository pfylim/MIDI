<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Here I am singin' my song to you now
I want you to listen yes
I want you to listen
Makin' my time go by, makin' you smile
I been thinkin' of you yes
I been thinkin' of you
And settlin' down

Back on the road agin here I'm alone again
Hotel ain't home no
Hotel ain't home
Worn out faces  don't care what the pace is
I miss my woman yes
I miss my woman

And settlin' down
She's hummin' another sound
I hear the music in my ear

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

In she comes a-ridin',
On a mornin' sunrise
I am left to believing
All that is standing before my eyes
And I wonder
Would the sun have shown
Ever so brightly alone

We been livin' all of our lives
On the other side of the hill
Drifting on a golden wing, and I can't wait
To hear the smile
She can sing
Take me through the day
Take my breath away

And we ride the countryside
High and wide, and she brings
Crackers, cheese and wine
Oh, they're gonna bust my side
And she's got strawberries
Comin' by the dozen
Brown sugar and sweet cream
Set my mouth a-buzzin'

Take my hand and run
Take me down to the river blue
Throw a whisper to the wind that
All you're sayin' is true
Ride the countryside
Take me high and wide

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

If it seems to you that I am fading

Everytime I try to talk to you
The words I'm speaking distort the view
And then I end up thinkin' what can I do
Now you're slippin' away for a new

Always hoping that the day will come
When I can face it, won't have to run
When all there has been is yet to come
When I don't hide my face from the sun
And I know it's myself it's not you

I can see everything
It's all in your smile that brings
All of the special things about you
If you could feel the way
That I do today we could
Find us a better way to get through

Everytime I climb into your eyes
I get so wasted and hypnotized
But there is one thing you can't disguise
That you're slippin' away for a new
Baby if I could control the time
Then I could stop it and redifine
Just what is real and how I've been so blind
I could put all the words into rhyme
And I know it's myself it's not you
If it seems to you that I am fading

<PRE>
(Stephen Stills)

You asked me to read this letter
That you wrote the night before
And you really should now better
'Cause she's worth a whole lot more, brother

You know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cry
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye

Then you said the fault was yours
And you really were to blame
'Twas as if to close the door
And to hide away in shame brother

You know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cry
Is that why you won't go and say goodbye

Yes and why tell me why
Can't you see that it's not right
It's a lie it's a lie
Don't hide your sorrow in the night brother

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Somebody called the keeper of the fire
Holy smoke I hope he ain't no lier
I've heard tell that while we're sleeping
All is well and safely keeping
We're only seeking

Then it came a mornin' we were feelin'
Just the same
Caring less...Let it turnitself to rain
Easy summer, and we're hung out high and dry
Somebody save us from this feelin'
Feeling in oureyes

Lookin' out there was a new light burnin'
Turned about everyone there kept on turnin'
Came on through like a childhood yearnin'

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Early times gone to rhyme
Somebody said it was a good time
To me it was a long long time
Just a long time

Early days gone to a gaze
Somebody said we'll make it crazy
And the leader passed it on
He got lazy

Songs they got to slippin' and
Right hand man took to trippin' and
The leader passed it on
Familiar faces I seen
Similar places and I wonder
How we left some traces

Come the moon Go the sun
And I believe there's something on the run
Catching up we ran so far behind
Early days gone to rhyme

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

When I need good lovin'
I always come home to you
You free my lifetime of the blues
Yes I got that old time feelin'
Burnin' deep inside my soul
And I am yours and baby I'm home

And it's a good feelin' to know
It's such a good feelin to know
Oh it's a good feelin' to know
Somebody loves you

Colorado mountains, I can see your
Distant skies
You're bringin' a tear of joy to my eyes

And it's a good feelin' to know
It's such a good feelin to know
Oh it's a good feelin' to know
Somebody loves you

<A NAME="8"><H2>RESTRAIN</H2><P>
<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Get on down off your ladder
Come out from the rain
Can't you see that there's no one to blame
And I got that feelin'
That we're playin' the same old game

You better get on the run
'Cause you know it's no fun
Restrain yourself

Can you tell me
Is it for certain or does it depend
Upon a feelin' that refuses to bend
Victim of circumstance you'll say to the end
And you pay no mind
You just watch it pass by
Restrain yourself

Restrain yourself till you can't restrain no more
Can you tell me why is it you sigh
Is it because of a need you deny
So come on up and deliver
What you really know
Maybe discover what it feels like
To grow

But you're just a mirror
Reflecting a show
Quiet on the scene now
Come out and take a bow
Don't restrain yourself

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
To light her way

Sun shinin' in the night
My newborn child
Oh my, sharin' her lovin' with me
I can see in her smile
Wordless are the thoughts
She's tryin' to say
Oh my, maybe she's seein' the light
Of a brighter day

So give her some lovin'
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
To light her way

Tears runnin' down my face in ecstacy
Oh my, how we gave life to this child
Baby you and me
With the love we shared inside

She found her way
Oh my, you know it makes me feel
So much more for today

So give her some lovin'
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
Sweet sweet love
To light her way
