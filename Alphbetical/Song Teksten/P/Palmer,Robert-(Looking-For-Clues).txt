It's crazy but I'm frightened by the sound of the telephone, oh yeah
I worry 'bout the caller that I wanna lose, oh my
Who knows it there were enough where the money goes, oh yeah
No doubt we could put it to a better use, oh my

You've been insisting that nobody showed you how to keep relationships, oh
yeah
Your daddy made the river dry, oh my
You say you know all along you can work it out, oh yeah
We don't have to make a fuss every time we fight, ooh
I'm looking for clues, looking for clues

I'll have to make an effort now just to be serious, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna live in the first place of the night, oh my
Ev'ry time I pick the paper up it's harder to believe the news, h yeah
I'm gonna shake it up and twist and shout, oh my
You can't do nothing that you put your money to, oh yeah
I suspected all along you were a tricky fool, oh my
I'm never in the dark as my heart keeps me well informed, oh yeah
I'm convinced there's a way on getting through to you
Ooh, I'm looking for clues, looking for clues

It's crazy but I'm frightened by the sound of ;relationships, oh yeah
I swear we could put it to a better use, oh my
Oh honey, maybe you've forgotten how to catch a night more, oh yeah
You told all the corners you were not amused
Ooh, I'm looking for clues

You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to use a telephone, oh yeah
Nobody's gonna give you a second chance, oh my
I don't have to make a living out of finding where the money goes, oh yeah
We don't have to make a fuss ev'ry time we fence
Ooh, I'm looking for clues, looking for clues
