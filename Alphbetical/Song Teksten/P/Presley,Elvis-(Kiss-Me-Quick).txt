       Kiss me quick            Elvis Presley 


Kiss me quick while we still have this feeling
Hold me close and never let me go
'Cause tomorrow can be so uncertain
Love can fly and leave just hurtin'
Kiss me quick because I love you so

Kiss me quick and make my heart go crazy
Sigh that sigh and whisper , oh so low
Tell me that tonight will last forever
Say that you will leave me never
Kiss me quick because I love you so

Let the band keep playing while we are swaying
Let's keep on praying that they'll never stop
Kiss me quick , I just can't stand this waiting
'Cause you lips are lips I long to know
For that kiss will open heaven's door 
And we'll stay there forever more

So kiss me quick because I love you so
Let the band keep playing while we are swaying ...
Kiss me quick because I love you so.
