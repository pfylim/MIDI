PRINCE - GLAM SLAM

(Words & music: Prince)

This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical
Glam Slam thank U ma'am 
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U'll always stay I
no I hold U 2 tight 
But I just can't seem 2 
get close enough
I want 2 hold U every nigh
I'm so horny and U're the stuff 
Glam Slam thank U ma'am 
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U'll always stay
Heavy feathers flicka nipple
Baby scram water ripple
If U don't understand it means
I love U
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
U go 4 me and I come again
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzin' on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam U really make my day
This thing we got - it's alive!
It seems 2 transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical
Glam Slam thank U ma'am 
U really make my day
Glam Slam thank U ma'am
I pray U'll always stay
