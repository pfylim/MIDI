BART PEETERS & THE RADIO'S - I'M INTO FOLK

I got a home computer
I got lots of floppy disks
But as for my taste in music
I won't take many risks
I only like the real thing
'Cause I'm a healthy bloke
My friends are into Hip Hop
But I'm into folk
I hear it in the country
I hear it in the town
I hear it in the pubs
Where I drink until I drown
Don't want to take no drugs
No pills, no shit, no coke
My friends are into Hip Hop
But I'm into folk
I'm into folk, I'm into folk
I told it to my friends 
but they thought it was a joke
I'm into folk, I'm into folk
My friends are into Hip Hop
But I'm into folk
I'm practicin' the fiddle
I'm practicin' the flute
It only takes a Banjo
To get me in the mood
You can tell my taste in music
By the giant pipes I smoke
My friends are into Hip Hop
But I'm into folk
