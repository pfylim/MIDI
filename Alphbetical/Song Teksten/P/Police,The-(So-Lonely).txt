Title  : SO LONELY

(Words & music: Sting Sumner)

Well someone told me yesterday
That when you throw your love away
You act as if you just don't care
You look as if you're going somewhere

But I just can't convince myself
I couldn't live with no one else
And I can only play that part
And sit and nurse my broken heart

Chorus:
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely, so lonely

Now no one's knocked upon my door
For a thousand years or more
All made up and nowhere to go
Welcome to this one man show

Just take a seat they're always free
No surprise, no mystery
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role

Chorus: ...

I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
I feel low, low, low
Low I feel low
I feel low, I feel low, I feel so lonely
I feel so lonely, I feel so lonely, lonely
Lonely low, lonely low, I feel so lonely

Chorus: ...
