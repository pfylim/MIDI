         VSP
     
         We called it a trap
         
         I can't walk out

         Because I love you too much baby
 
         
         Why can't you see

         What you're doing to me
 
         When you don't believe the word I say
    

        WE CAN'T GO ON TOGETHER, WITH SUSPICIOUS MINDS (SUSP.MINDS)
              
        AND WE CAN BUILD OUR DREAMS ON SUSPICIOUS MINDS

       
        With an old friend I know

        I started say hello

        Would I still see suspicion  in your eyes
 
       
        Here we go again

        Asking where I've been

        You can't see the tears I feel I'm crying(YES I'M CRYING)

        REFREIN

        ALL THAT I LOVE TO FIND, ARE RATHER TEARS DROPPING BY

        AND SO LET THE GOOD THINGS DIE, BUT YOU KNOW THAT I NEVER

        LIED TO YOU,  MMMM  (YEAH,YEAH)

        We called it a trap
        I can't walk out
        Because I love you too much baby

        Why can't you see
        What you're doing to me
        When you don't believe a word I'm saying
