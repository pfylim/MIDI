PRINCESS - AFTER THE LOVE HAS GONE

I read the words
Time and time again
I could not believe my eyes
You broke my heart in every line
How you hurt me, ooh ooh ooh ooh

When I think about
How it used to be
We'd see each other every day
Now you say things have changed
How you hurt me, ooh ooh ooh ooh

REFRAIN:
After the love has gone
How can I go on
When there's nothing anyone can do
I'm still in love with you
After the love has gone (love has gone)
I must be strong
But life must go on
After the love has gone

I gave you everything
I gave you all my love
How  you made me feel secure
But now you shut the door
How you hurt me yeah

REFRAIN: ...

When there's nothing anyone can do
I'm still in love with you
After the love has gone (love has gone)
I must be strong
But life must go on
After the love has gone
