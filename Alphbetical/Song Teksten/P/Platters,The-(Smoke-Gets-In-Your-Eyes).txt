            Smoke gets in your eyes


They asked me how I knew my true love was true
I of course replied something here inside 
cannot be denied

They said someday you'll find 
all who love are blind
when your heart's on fire you must realize
smoke get's in your eyes

Refrain 

So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
to think they could doubt my love
yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love


Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
so I smile and say when a lovely flame dies
smoke get's in your eyes
