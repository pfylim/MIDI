<PRE>
(Richie Furay/Rusty Young)

Well, I'm going to a hoe down
And kick up my heels
Go all night and never slow down
Yes, I love how it feels

Come on and go to the hoe down
And kick up your heels
You go all night and never slow down
Bet you'll love how it feels.

In ev'ry day that passes us by
I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together.
Looks like bad weather.

I can see it all there in your eyes
And it comes to me as no surprise
That you don't need me here no more.
Your feeling tells the score.

Words, they are getting
Hard for me to find.
You take me by my hand
And you're leading me blind.

In ev'ry day that passes us by
I can't help the feelin' that you and I
We won't get to see another day together.
Looks like bad weather.

Yes it does,
And I believe it's gonna rain.

(Richie Furay)

You've had me to love now
But what will you do
If I'm heartaches to you
This livin' like two.

I fear it could be poison
From the taste
Seems my whole life
Should be retraced.
What am I gonna do?

When I'm locked in the middle
With a key that's from you
And another one, too
But which door to undo.

Visions in the keyhole
Leaves me blind.
I should have seen
A warnin' sign.
What am I gonna do?

And now it's one or the other
But how can I choose
When there's a chance that
  I might lose
The one that I refuse

All the love of two
Won't leave me free
And losin' you for her
Leaves less of me.
What am I gonna do?

Look up, wake up
The sun is shinin'
No it's not tomorrow
It's today.

Stand up, make up
For what you're finding
'Cause anyonewho's turned around
And lost his way
Is looking for you.
You are the one
Who only needs to show a smile.

You are the one
Who can make any day be worthwhile.
You are the one.
You are the one.

Shameless, tameless
Are ways about you
And changing them now
Would seem unreal.

Nameless, aimless
Who shouldn't doubt you
I wonder if you really know
What you feel
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.
You are the one
Who only needs to show a smile.

You are the one
Who can make any day be worthwhile.
You are the one.
You are the one.

<PRE>
(Paul Cotton)

Saturday feelin' like Sunday
And I really haven't made my way.
A lost road
It's a blownup railroad
Got to find a new engineer today.

And it's twice as hard on my stride
When I take a day and let it ride.

Hello, how are you, how do you do
Can you help me, come jump in my shoes
You'll know the feelin' of me
Thinkin' about you
And you really haven't made your way.

And ooh, it's a lost road
A blownup railroad
Got to find a new track, lay it down,
   now delay.

Welcome be stranger
With a drivin' wheel all his own
Me, the rearranger
And I can't find home

<PRE>
(Timothy B. Schmit)

Sittin' near ya, starin' at ya,
Saying nothing.
Wond'rin' if you're really you
And if I'm someone
That you could know
Beyond the first hello.

Eyes that search like the morning sun
But never finding
Silently I can feel the glow
And I'm not minding
But then you know
I've been tryin' to show
Why it makes me cry
Talkin' it over from the inside.

Something new and oh, so sacred
Grows within the depths of you
But still I just can't keep from wond'rin'
For I'm but a child, too.

Changes timelessly fill the spaces.
It's so blind of me.
I've seen the faces of a gifted few
Who can help us break our chains that bind.

Thinkin' all the time
Why I can't unwind
You must feel the pain
Why it makes me cry
I'm talkin' it over from the inside.

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

Thought a girl was a girl and then
I found myself in love again.
Yes, I've been in love a time or two
But it never happened like it did with you.
Do you feel it, too?

Yea, my heart just went for a ride
Certain feelings you just can't hide
About the ways of the girls, ah,
   but not like you.
Baby, do you feel it, too?

Please remember how
I feel about you.
Let me know right now
That I'm pleasing you.

(Paul Cotton)

Ol' forgiver,
You're a true life giver
When I'm cold
Warm me when I shiver

Ol' forgiver
When I'm runnin' you down
Now ain't you the clown
I'm chasing, madly embracing.

You got me laughing inside
At the happy face I'm facing
Ol' forgiver
You wear it all on the outside.

You're quiet and unspoken
And I take it as a token
That I'll be broken
Long before you will be.
Yeah, you'll se

Ol' forgiver
You bring a day that is lasting
Still it's slowly slowly drifting by
For the lucky son
Of an unknown mother.

Ol' forgiver, fill my eyes.
Ol' forgiver, come on and fill my eyes.
I see you fillin' up my eyes.
Ol' forgiver, come on and fill up,
Fill up my eyes.

<PRE>
(Richie Furay)

What if I should say I love you
Would you spend some time?
I'll tell you what I'm thinkin' of you
But if I do, do you have to know why?

When I look at you,
Are you wond'rin who
I am to do
Such a thing to you.
I bet you know that you're breakin'
   my heart.
I bet you know . . . my heart.

What if I should say I love you
Baby, would you steal away my heart
And could the moment last for always
And ever, or should we even start.

When you look at me,
All the world can see
I suddenly
Want your love for me.
I bet you know that you're breakin'
   my heart.
I bet you know . . . my heart.

Maybe someday I would be gone
Then you'd be alone
Won'drin' what's wrong
How could it begin and then be gone.

(Richie Furay)

Wish that I could come
With the mornin' sun
Shinin' through your window
I could be the one

To open up your day
Ooh, words can't begin to say
Feelings that are hidden in
In such a special way
And tey're just for me and you.

Nighttime comes searhin' blindly
Been needin' some lovin'
I find me followin' my heart
   back to you
Ooh, how it reminds me
That I need no other lover
This feelin' is like no other
And though I can't be with you now
Let this song be another one
That's just for me and you.

So let my heart go on a-singin'
Let my song go on a-bringin'
To you lovin' that you know
Is in my heart and clingin'
To days that passed on by
Need we stop, though, to
   wonder why
You know I love you, baby
The tears in my eyes are
Just for me and you.
