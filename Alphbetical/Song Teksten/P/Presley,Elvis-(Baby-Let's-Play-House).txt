Well, you may go to college,
you may go to school; You may have a pink Cadillac,
but don't you be nobody's fool. 

Now baby come back baby
come come back baby,
come come back baby
I wanna play house with you.

Now, listen and I tell you, baby,
what I'm talkin' about.
Come on back to me, little girl,
so we can play some house.

Now baby come back baby
come come back baby,
come come back baby
I wanna play house with you.

Now, this is one thing, baby,
that I want you to know,
come on back and let's play a little house
so we can act like we did before.

Now baby come back baby
come come back baby,
come come back baby
I wanna play house with you.

Now. listen to me baby,
try to understand,
I'd rather see you dead, little girl,
than to be with another man.

Now baby come back baby
come come back baby,
come come back baby
I wanna play house with you.
