I'LL STAND BY YOU - The Pretenders

Oh, why you look so sad
The tears are in eyes
Come on and come to me love
Don't be assamed to cry
Let me see you through
'Coz I've seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
Don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Can make me love you less

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you

So, if you may get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
And hey, what you got to hide
I get angry too
But I'm a lot like you
When your standing at the crossroads
Don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
'Coz even if your wrong

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you

And when, when the night falls on you baby
You'll feelling all alone
You won'bt be all alone

I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me on onto your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Baby on into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
