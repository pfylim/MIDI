ONLY YOU - PLATTERS


Only you can do make all this world seem right.
Only you can do make the darkness bright.
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do.
And to fill my heart with love for only you.

O Only you can do make all this change in me.
For it`s true you are my destiny.
When you hold my hand I understand
The magic that you do.
You`re my dream come true.
My one and only you.
