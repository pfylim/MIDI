--------------------------------------------------------
1) I double cross you and you
   get mysterios mail i've tried not to shock you
   it's hard no to with the things i could say
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain:
Tell me why don't we cry
not to break our hearts
and make it so hard for ourselves
--------------------------------------------------------
2) You lock your letters in a box
   and you're hidden the key i go one better
   i'm indebted to a contact magazine
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain:
Tell me why don't we cry
not to break our hearts
and make it so hard for ourselves
--------------------------------------------------------
3) Everybody's got to live together just to find
   a little piece of mind there
   if you give up your affairs forever
   i will give up mine but it's hard so hard
--------------------------------------------------------
4) I'm always hoping you'll be faithful
   but you're not i suppose
   we've both given up smoking cause it's fatal
   so whose matches are those
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain:
Tell me why don't we cry
not to break our hearts
and make it so hard for ourselves
--------------------------------------------------------
