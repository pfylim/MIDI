PRINCE - ALPHABET STREET

(Words & music: Prince)

I'm goin' down 2 Alphabet Street
I gonna crown the first girl that I meet
I'm gonna talk so sexy she'll want me from my head 2 my feet
I'm gonna drive my daddy's Thunderbird
A white rad ride '67 so glam it's absurd
I'm gonna put her in the backseat and drive her 2 Tennessee
I'll say excuse me baby I don't mean 2 be rude
But I guess tonight I'm just not in the mood
So if U don't mind I would like 2 ... watch .. can I ?
We're goin' down, down, down if that's the only way
2 make this cruel, cruel world hear what we've got 2 say
Put the right letters together and make a better day
Maybe it's the only way up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cat, we need U 2 rap
Cat, we need U 2 rap
Don't give it 2 us slow, Cause we know U know New power soul
Gotta gotta go! Talk 2 me lover come and tell me what U taste
Didn't your mama tell U life is 2 good 2 waste?
Didn't she tell U Lovesexy was the glam of them all?
If U can hang, U can trip on it
U surely won't fall, no side effects and the feeling last
4-ever, straight up
it tastes good, it makes U feel clever U kiss your enemies like
U know U should
Then U jerk your body like a horny pony would 
U jerk your body like a horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
