Title  : MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE

(Words & music: Sting)

Just a castaway, an island lost at sea-o
Anuzzer lonely day, no one here but me-o
More loneliness that any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair-o

Chorus:
I'll send an S.O.S. to the world
I'll send an S.O.S. to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle
Message in a bottle

A year has passed since I wrote my not
But I should have know this right from the start
Only hpe can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

Chorus: ...

Walked out this morning, don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles washed up on the shore
Seems I'm not alon in being alone
A hundred billion castaways lookin' for a home

Chorus: ...

Sending out an S.O.S.
Sending out an S.O.S.
Sending out an S.O.S.
