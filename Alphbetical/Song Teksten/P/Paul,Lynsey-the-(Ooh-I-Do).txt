Singer : LYNSEY DE PAUL 
Title  : OOH I DO

The highschool dance began at eight
But mum and dad said don't be late
They never ever seem to understand
I'm not the little girl they think I am
They think I am

Ooh ooh I do oh yes I do love you
Ooh ooh I do yes I do wo wo wo
No no no no no no no no

I know for you it's just the name
And if we're young we're not to blame
They don't believe in teenage love affairs
They'll never know how much we really care
We really care

Ooh ooh I do oh yes I do love you
Ooh ooh I do yes I do wo wo wo
No no no no no no no no
