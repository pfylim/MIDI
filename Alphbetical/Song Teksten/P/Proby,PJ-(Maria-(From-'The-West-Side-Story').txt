13. WEST SIDE STORY (MARIA) - P.J. PROBY

Maria, 
I' ve just met a girl named Maria
And suddenly that name will never be the same to me
Maria!
I've just have kissed a girl named Maria
And suddenly I've found how wonderful a sound can be!
Maria!
Say it loud and there's music playing
Say it soft and it's alost like praying
Maria, I'll never stop sayin' : "Maria"
