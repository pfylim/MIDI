Propaganda

On joyless lanes we walk in lines
A calm but steady flow
Accompanied by loud commands
Our strength is running low

Another hope feeds another dream
Another truth installed by the machine
A secret wish
The marrying of lies
Today comes true
What common sense denies

Rotating wheels of destiny
In flame the city lies
Machines call out for followers
Far out into the night
The calls of the machines
Drowning in the steam

Another hope feeds another dream
Another truth installed by the machine
A secret wish
The marrying of lies
Today makes true
What common sense denies

The calls of the machines
Drowning in the steam

On joyless lanes we walk in lines
(A calm but steady flow)
(Our strength is running low)

Another hope
Another dream
Another truth
Installed by the machines
