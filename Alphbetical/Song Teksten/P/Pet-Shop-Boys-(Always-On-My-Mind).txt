PET SHOP BOYS - ALWAYS ON MY MIND

Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time

refrain:
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you, all those lonely lonely times
And I guess I never told you, I'm so happy that you're mine
If I made you feel second best, I' sorry I was blind

refrain: ...

Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time

refrain: ...

Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I never took the time
