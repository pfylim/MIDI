       Neutron Dance ( Pointer Sisters )


I don't want to take it anymore ,
I'll just stay here locked behind the door .
Just no time to stop and get away 
'Cause I work so hard to make it every day .
There's no money falling from the sky 
'Cause a man took my heart and robbed me blind .
Someone stole my brand-new Chevrolet
And the rent is due , I've got no place to stay .

And it's hard to say just how some things never change ,
And it's hard to find any strenght to draw the line .
Oh, I'm just burning doing the neutron dance .
I'm just burning doing the neutron dance .

Industry don't pay a price that's fair ,
All the common people breathing filthy air .
Roof caved in on all the simple dreams ,
And to get ahead your heart starts pumping shemes .
And it's hard to say just how some things never change ,...

I'm on fire , yeah , well , I'm on fire , yeah .
and it's hard to say just how some things never change ,...

I know there's a pot of gold for me  , all I got to do is just believe .
Oh , I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance ,
and I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance .
I'm so happy  - it's in my hands - doin'the neutron dance , well ,
I'm just burning - it's in my feet - doin' the neutron dance ,
Well , well , well ,  well .

I'm so happy doin' the neutron dance ,
I'm just burning doin' the neutron dance .
I'm so happy - it's in my hands , I'm just burning - it's in my feet .
I'm so happy , I'm just burning , I'm so happy , I'm just burning .
I'm so happy , I'm just burning .
