Title  : DE DO DO DO DE DA DA DA
Artist : THE POLICE

(Words & music: Sting)

Don't think me unkind
Words are hard to find
They're only cheques I've left unsigned
From the banks of chaos in my mind
And when their eloquence escapes me
Their logic ties me up and rapes me

Chorus:
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
Their innocence pulls me through
De do do do, de da da da
Is all I want to say to you
De do do do, de da da da
The meaningless and all that's true

Poets, priests and politicians
Have words to thank for their positions
Words that scream for your submission
And no on's jamming their transmission
'Cos when their eloquence escapes you
Their logic ties you up and rapes you

Chorus: ...
