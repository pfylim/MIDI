Title  : Partyman
Singer : Prince


All Hail - the new king in town
Young and old gather 'round
Black and white, red and green
The funkiest man u've ever seen

Tell u what his name is -
Partyman, Partyman
Rock a party like nobody can
Rule and regulations - no place in this nation
Partyman, Partyman

Party people - say it now: Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Somebody holler if u wanna party

I rock the party, I rock the house
I rock the whole world, north, east and south
In the west - 17 horns blowin'

All hail the new king in town

Ain't nothin' but a muffin
We gotta lotta butter 2 go
And if it break when it bend
U better not put it in - oh!

All hail the new king in town - Partyman
