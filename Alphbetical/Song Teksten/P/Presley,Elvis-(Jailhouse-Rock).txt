The warden threw a party in the County jail,
the prison band was there and they began to wail,
the band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing.
You should've heard those knocked out jail birds sing.

Let's Rock
Let's Rock !
Ev'rybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the jailhouse Rock !

Spider Murphy play'd the tenor saxophone,
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone,
the whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang.

Let's Rock
Let's Rock !
Ev'rybody in the whole cell block
was dancin' to the jailhouse Rock !
