Singer : THE PRETENDERS
Title  : BRASS IN POCKET

(Words & music: Hynde/Honeyman/Scott)

Got brass in pocket
Got bottle, I'm gonna use it
Intention, I feel inventive
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice

Got motion, restrained emotion
Been driving, Detroit leaning
No reason, just seem so pleasing
Gotta make you, make you, make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination

'Cause I gotta make you see
There's nobody else here
No one like me
I'm special, so special
I gotta have some of your attention
Give it to me

Got rhythm, can't miss a beat
Got new skank, it's so neat
Got something, I'm winking at you
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice
