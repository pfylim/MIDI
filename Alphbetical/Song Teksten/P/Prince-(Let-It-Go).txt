ALL MY LIFE I'VE KEPT MY FEELINGS DEEP INSIDE
NEVER WAS A REASON TO LET SOMEBODY KNOW
LOVER HERE LOVER THERE WHO CRIED WHO CARED WHO LIVES BRIGHT
NEVER WAS A GOOD SEAT ANY OF THIS SPECIALS

UNTIL NOW ALL I WANTED TO DO IS
DO DO DO WHAT I'M DOING
BANG BANG BANGING ON THE DRUMMER AND LOVE SO AND SO

CHORUS:
BUT NOW I'VE GOT TO LET IT GO (LET IT GO)
LAY BACK AND LET THE FIRE JUST FLOW
I WANT TO JUST LET IT GO (LET IT GO)
LAY BACK AND LET MY FEELINGS SHOW

I'M READY FOR THE REAL
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN FEEL

ALL MY LIFE THIS HOUSE'S BEEN UNDER LOCK AND KEY
I CAME WITH JOAN THERE WAS NOBODY HOME
TRIGGER HERE TRIGGER THERE EVERYBODY'S HIGH EXCEPT FOR ME
BETTER OFF DEAD IF I COULD BE ALONE

UNTIL NOW ALL I WANTED TO DO IS
DO DO DO WHAT I'M DOING
BANG BANG BANGING ON THE DRUMMER AND LOVE SO AND SO

CHORUS

I'M READY FOR THE REAL
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN FEEL

SOLO

DOWN ALONE
FOURTEEN YEARS AND TEARS I'VE LONGED TO SING MY SONG
BUT A HORSE COULDN'T DRAG YOUR ASS TO PUT ME ON
BUT NOW I'VE GOT IT AND A NUMBER IN WITH THREE BILLION STRONG
THE SONG WE'RE MAKING YOUR EARS WHEN WE'RE ALONE

UNTIL NOW ALL I WANTED TO DO IS
DO DO DO WHAT I'M DOING
BANG BANG BANGING ON THE DRUMMER AND LOVE SO AND SO

CHORUS

LET IT GO
LAY BACK AND LET THE FIRE JUST FLOW
