Title  : CANTARA PEPE
Artist : THE PRESS

(Words & music: John Coenen/Walther Nita)

Chorus:
Cantara Pepe
Oh, la la
Condinero a tus amigos volveras
Cantara Pepe
Oh, la la
You will return to sunny Castellar

He is just a waiter in a fancy bar
From dawn till late at night
He is working hard
But when he dreams
He dreams of sunny spain
'Cause here there is only pooring rain

Remember siestas in the cool, cool shade
The fiestas were so hot
The girls so great
And memories gone
He is feeling kind of strange
But soon his luck is gonna change

He saves pesetas to go to Castellar
Where one day Pepe will open Pepe's bar
The winter is long, but it might be in spring
That everybody is gonna sing, sing, sing, sing

Chorus: ...
