You saw me crying in the chapel, the tears I shed were tears of joy.
I know the meaning  of contentment, now I am happy with the Lord.
Just a plain and simple chapel, where humple people go to pray.
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger, as I live from day to day.
I've searched and I've searched, but I couldn't find,
No way on earth to gain peace of mind. 
Now I'm happy in the chapel, where people are of one accord.
We gather in the chapel, just to sing and praise the Lord.

Ev'ry sinner looks for something, that will put his heart at ease.
There is only one true answer, he must get down on his knees.
Meet your neighbor in the chapel, join with him in tears of joy.
You'll know the meaning of contentment, then you'll be happy with the the Lord.
You'll search and you'll search, but you'll never find.
No way on earth to gain peace of mind.
Take your troubles to the chapel, get down on your knees and pray.
Your burdens will be lighter, and you'll surely find the way.
