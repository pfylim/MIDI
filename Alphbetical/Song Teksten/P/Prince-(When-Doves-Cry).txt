PRINCE - WHEN DOVES CRY

Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engage in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling can you fix your lips
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat the heat between me and you

Refrain:
How can you leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold (world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you even doves that cry

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold (world that's so cold)
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
(My father you know he's too bold)
Maybe you're just like my mother
(Maybe you're just like my mother)
She's never satisfied (she's never satisfied)
(Why) why do we scream (scream) at each other (why)
This is what it sounds like when doves cry

When doves cry (when doves cry, when doves cry)
when doves cry (when doves cry doves cry
doves doves cry)
