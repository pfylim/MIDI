I wake up in the morning
and I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
and the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
a six gun lover
a candle in the wind

When you're brought into this world
they say you're born in sin
well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
well they tell me that I'm wanted
yeah I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
mister catch me if you can

I'm going down in a blaze of glory
take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
but I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
call me young gun

You ask about my conscience
and I offer you my soul
you ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
well I ask if I'll grow old
you ask me if I've know love
and what it's like to sing songs in the rain
well, I've seen love come
and I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain

Shot down in a blaze of glory
take me now but know the truth
'cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
but I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
call me young gun

Solo

Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
no I ain't looking for forgiveness
but before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favour
and I hope you'll understand
'cause I've lived life to the fullest
let this boy die like a man
staring down a bullet
let me make my final stand

Shot down in a blaze of glory
take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
but I drew first blood
and I'm no one's son
call me young gun
I'm a young gun.
