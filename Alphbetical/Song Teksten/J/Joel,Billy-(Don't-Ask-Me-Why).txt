Title  : DON'T ASK ME WHY
Artist : BILLY JOEL

(Words & music: Billy Joel)

All the waiters in your grand cafe
Leave their tables when you blink
Every drink must have his drink
Don't wait for answers
Don't ask me why

All your life you had to stand in line
Still you're standing on your feet
All your choices made you change your mind
Now your calendar's complete
Don't wait for answers
Just take your chances
Don't ask me why

You can say the human heart
Is only make believe
And I am only fighting fire with fire
But you are still a victim
Of the accidents you leave
As sure as I'm a victim of desire

All the servants in your new hotel
Throw their roses at your feet
Fool them all but baby I can't tell
You're no stranger to the street
Don't ask for favors
Don't talk to strangers
Don't ask me why

Yesterday you were an only child
Now your ghosts have gone away
You can kill them in the classic style
Now you parlez vous francais
Don't look for answers
You took your chances
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
