Title  : GOT A FEELING 

(Words & music: J. Moralli/V. Willis)

Got a feeling that I will be leaving
Got a feeling that I will be leaving
Got a feeling that I will be leaving you
Got a feeling that I won't be needing
Got a feeling that I won't be needing
Got a feeling that I won't be needing you

'Cause I have found someone
To make me feel so brand new
You always made me feel my world was blue
Now I feel so alive when you made me feel
The world was hard and cool
I was a fool to think that I should stay
Now I know that I can get away

Got a feeling
Got a feeling
Got a feeling
Got a feeling
Got a feeling
Got a feeling

Got a feeling that I will be leaving
Got a feeling that I will be leaving
Got a feeling that I will be leaving you
Got a feeling that I won't be needing
Got a feeling that I won't be needing
Got a feeling that I won't be needing you

Got a feeling
