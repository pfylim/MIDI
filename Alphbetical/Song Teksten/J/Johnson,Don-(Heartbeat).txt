DON JOHNSON - HEARTBEAT

I don't care what you say
You can give it away
Your money don't mean much to me
I been out on my own
Gonna go it alone
'Cause that's the way it's got to be
Ev'rybody tells me now
I can beat the odds for now
Well I been standing by the fire
But I just can't feel the heat

Refrain:
Heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat, heartbeat
I'm looking for a heartbeat
Beating like mine, beating like mine

Looking at me
It's easy to see
You think you know just how I feel
If you do me wrong
It won't take me long
Before my restless heart will heal
I'm looking for a love love like mine
They tell me it's so hard to find
But I can feel it in the rhythm
Of the heartbeat in the street

Refrain: ...

Tell me what you feel now
Without the heartbeat tell me
What is real now
Without the heartbeat

Refrain: ...(3x)...
