          GREEN  GREEN  GRASS  OF  HOME
   
       
         The old home town looks the same
         As I step down from the train
         And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
         Down the road I look and there runs Mary
         Hair of gold and lips like cherries

         It's good to touch the green, green grass of home 
        
         Yes, they'll all come to meet me
         Arms reaching smiling sweetly
         It's good to touch the green, green grass of home                
         
         The old house is still standing
         Tho' the paint is cracked and dry
         And there's that old oak tree
         That I used to play on
         Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
         Hair of gold and lips like cherries
         It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

         The old home town looks the same. . . . . . . . .
