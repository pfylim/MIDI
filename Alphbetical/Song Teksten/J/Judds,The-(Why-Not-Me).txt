Title  : Why not me
Singer : The Judds


You've been looking for love all around the world, baby
Don't you know this country girl's still free
Why not me

So you've finally come down to your old home town
Your Kentucky girl's been awaitin' patiently
Why not me

Refrein:
Why not me on a rainy day
Why not me to love your cares away
Why not me
Why not me when the nights get cold
Why not me when you're growing' old
Why not me

You've been searchin' from here to Singapore
Ain't it time that you noticed tje girl next door
Baby, why not me

You had to see if the world was round
It's time that you learned how good settlin' down could be
Why not me

Refrein
