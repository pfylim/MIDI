Title  : OHN - A LITTLE MORE LOVE

(Words & music: J. Farrar)

Night is dragging her feet
I wait alone in the heat

I know
Know that you'll have your way
Till you have to go home
No, is the word I can't say

Chorus:
'Cause it's get me nowhere
To tell you no
And it gets me nowhere
To make you go
Will a little more love
Make you stop depending
Will a little more love
Bring your happy ending
Will a little more love
Make it right
Will a little more love
Make it right

Where
Where did my innocence go
How
How was a young girl to know

I'm trapped
I'm trapped in the spell of your eyes
In the warmth of your arms
In the web of your lies

Chorus: ...2x...
