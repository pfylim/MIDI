Title  : GET UP AND BOOGIE

(Words & music: Tony Green)

Hey, you over there
Get up, up that chair
Disco's made for dancin'
And I just sit and stare
Get down on the dance floor
And let your body move
The music's playing loud
You'll get into move

Chorus:
Get up and boogie
Get up and boogie
Ooh, ooh, get up and boogie
Ooh, ooh, everybody, get up and boogie
Everybody get up and boogie

Come on shake your boulder
Get down to the beat
Gear your body into motion
Generation beat
Come on, push, push, in the push
Get down to the freak
Let your body boogie, boogie
Hear the same as beat

Chorus: ...

Let the music take you high
Till your body don't stand by

Everybody, get up and boogie
Everybody, get up and boogie

Slam, bam, wam, jam, get up and boogie (4x)

Everybody, get up and boogie
