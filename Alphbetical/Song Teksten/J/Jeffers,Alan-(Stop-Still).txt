Title  : STOP STILL

(Words & music: Donnell Jones)

Chorus:
Don't you know we've got to stop still
We'll find out if our love is real
Oh we know just how it feels
If there's a will, there's got to be a way

Chorus: ...

Don't you know girl it's time to check out our lives
And rearrange our state of mind
We're adults and it's plain to see
Why don't we start acting accordingly

Chorus: ...3x...

Can't you see
If we can't make it we ought to be apart
Learn us to play with each others hearts
We're playing these foolish games
Causing each other a whole lotta pain

Chorus: ...
