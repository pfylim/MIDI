Singer : TERRY JACKS 
Title  : SEASONS IN THE SUN 
 
Refrain: 
We had joy we had fun 
We had seasons in the sun 
But the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time 
We had joy we had fun 
We had seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone 
 
Goodbye to you my trusted friend 
We've known each other since we were nine or ten 
Together we've climbed hills and trees 
Learned of love and A-B-C's 
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees 
Goodbye my friend it's heart to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
Pretty girls are everywhere 
Think of me and I'll be there 
 
Goodbye papa please pray for me 
I was the black sheep of the family 
You tried to teach me right from wrong 
Too much wine and too much song 
Wonder how I got along 
Goodbye papa it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
Little children everywhere 
When you'll see them I'll be there 
 
Goodbye Michelle my little one 
You gave me love and helped me find the sun 
And every time that I was down 
You would always come around and get my 
feet back on the ground 
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
With the flowers everywhere 
I wish that we could both be there 
 
Refrain: ... 
 
All our lives we had fun we had seasons in the sun 
But the stars we could reach 
were just starfish on the beach
