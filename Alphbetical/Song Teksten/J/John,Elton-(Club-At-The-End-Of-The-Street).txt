                        Club at the end of the street    Elton John


When the shades are drawn an the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above walk heavens hand in hand. There's a shadey place at the end of the working day
Where young lovers go and this hot little trio plays.
That's where we meet, that's where we meet Me and you, rendzvous, in the club at the end of the street.
Ooh, where we meet, Ooh, where we meet, Me and you, rendevous in the club at the end of the street.

From the alleyways where the catwalks gently sway You hear the sound of otis and the voice of Marvin Gaye.
In this smokey room, there's a jukebox plays all night. And we can dance real close beneath the plus of a neon light.

That's where we meet, that's where we meet,....

There's a downtown smee of cooking from the flame on a open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumpin', lord have mercy. Ooh, Ya can't sit still, Oh Ya can't sit still.

That's where we meet, that's where we meet.....
