        Beat it ( Michael Jackson )


They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face .
You better disappear !
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it , just beat it
You better run , you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood .
Don't wanna be a machoman .
You wanna be tough better do what you can
So beat it . But you wanna be bad .

Refr. 

Just beat it , beat it .
Noone wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it
Just beat it , just beat it

They're out to get you .
Better leave while you can .
Don't wanna be a boy you wanna be a man .
You wanna stay alive better do what you can .
So beat it , just beat it .
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life.
This ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you , then beat you , then tell you it's fair .
So beat it , but you wanna be bad .
