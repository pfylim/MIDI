Title  : LIFE

(Words & music: Biddu)

Refrain:
Life, nothing's more precious than life
It feels so good being alive
Look at the stars in the night
Oh, there may be trouble and strife
It's not a great sacrifice
For your life

Who needs money
It only gets spent
The freedom of life is
Heaven sent
Why don't you open your eyes
And maybe you'll realize
Even on cloudy days
Sunshine comes best to your way

Refrain: ...

Look all around you
What do you see
Beyond the cities are
Mountains and trees
Why don't you open your eyes
And make your own paradise
I live the life I lead
I lead the life that I love

Refrain: ...2x...
