1.Strophe
Eb    Dbadd9           Gb6
I was wandering in the rain.
        Ab              Eb
Mask of life, feelin' insane
          Dbadd9           Gb6
Swift and sudden fall from grace
      Ab             Eb
Sunny days seem far away
          Dbadd9            Gb6
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
         Ab                Eb
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
       Dbadd9       Gb6
On and on and on it came
         Ab                    Eb
Wish the rain would just let me be
Abm         A
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Abm         A
How does it feel
Gbm         G
How does it feel
A6
When you're alone

And you're cold inside
Eb    Dbadd9         Gb6
Here abandoned in my fame
    Ab            Eb
Armageddon of the brain
  Dbadd9        Gb6
KGB was doggin' me
        Ab                   Eb
Take my name and just let me be
       Dbadd9               Gb6
Then a begger boy called my name
      Ab                  Eb
Happy days will drown the pain
       Dbadd9       Gb6
On and on and on it came And again,
        Ab                   Eb
Take my name and just let me be
Abm         A
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Abm         A
How does it feel
Gbm         G
How does it feel
Gbm         G
How does it feel
Abm         A
How does it feel (How does it feel)
Abm         A
How does it feel
Gbm         G
How does it feel
A6
When you're alone

And you're cold inside

A stranger in Moscow
