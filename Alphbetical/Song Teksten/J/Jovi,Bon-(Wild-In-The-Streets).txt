Joey comes from a sacred part of town
where sometimes you talk so tough
that your feet don't touch the ground
and the sidewalk soldiers sing their midnite blues
while the old men recite their story lines
about when I was young like you
they say: Oh yeah
we were cruising to the backbeat
oh yeah, making love in the backseats
we were wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets.

A member of the boys brigade
had a date with the girl next door
you know it made her daddy crazy
but it only made her want him more
they weren't looking for trouble
you know that boy didn't want a fight - not tonight
so she headed out thru her bathroom window
what her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright
they said: Oh yeah
we were cruising to the backbeat
oh yeah, making love in the backseats
we were wild, wild in the streets
wild, wild in the streets.
wild, wild in the streets.
wild, wild in the streets.

Sometimes this town ain't pretty
but you know it ain't so bad
just like a girl who looks so happy
whan inside she's so sad
in here we got this code of honor
nobody's going down
you don't walk in vain
through the kid's parade
'cause this is my hometown.
