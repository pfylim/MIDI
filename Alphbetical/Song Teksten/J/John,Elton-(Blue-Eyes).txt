BLUE EYES (ELTON JOHN)


BLUE EYES
BABY'S GOT BLUE EYES
LIKE A DEEP BLUE SEA
ON A BLUE, BLUE DAY

BLUE EYES
BABY'S GOT BLUE EYES
WHEN THE MORNING COMES
I'LL BE FAR AWAY
AND I SAY
BLUE EYES HOLDING BACK THE TEARS
HOLDING BACK THE PAIN

BABY'S GOT BLUE EYES
AND SHE'S ALONE
AGAIN

BLUE EYES
BABY'S GOT BLUE EYES
LIKE A CLEAR BLUE SKY
WATCHING OVER ME

BLUE EYES
OOH, I LOVE BLUE EYES
WHEN I'M BY YOUR SIDE
WHERE I LONG TO BE
I WILL SEE
BLUE EYES LAUGHING IN THE SUN
LAUGHING IN THE RAIN

BABY'S GOT BLUE EYES
AND I AM HOME
AGAIN
