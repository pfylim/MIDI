JOE JACKSON - IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM?

(Words & music: Joe Jackson)

Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there, where?
There there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something so I'm told

Refrain:
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here

Tonight's the night
When I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there, where?
There here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so there goes your proof

Refrain: ...

But if looks could kill, there's a man
There who's marked down as dead
'Cause I had my fill
Listen you, take your hands of her head
I guess I'm mean around the scene
Ooh ooh ooh

Refrain: ...
