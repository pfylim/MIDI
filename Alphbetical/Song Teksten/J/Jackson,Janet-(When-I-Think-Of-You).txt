JANET JACKSON - WHEN I THINK OF YOU

Ooh baby
Any time my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

Refrain:
'Cause when I think of you baby
Nothing else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you baby
All I think about is our love

I just get more attached to you
When you hold me in your arms
And squeeze me
Then you leave me
And make me blue

Refrain: ...

So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Right there (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
You (so in love)
With you (so in love)
(so in love)

When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you
When I think of you

I'm so in love
I just think of you
You're my lover ah
When I think of you
(so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
With you (so in love)
Baby you (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)
So in love (so in love)
Ooh (so in love)

Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah yeah
