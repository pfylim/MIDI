Title  : IS EVERYBODY HAPPY

Is everybody happy (yeah)
Is everybody fine (yeah)
Is everybody ready (yeah)

Won't you say yes
Don't you say no
To sing and to dance
And yell with our friends
Won't you say hey
Don't go away
Because today

Is everybody happy
Is everybody fine
Is everybody ready

Won't you say yes
Don't you say no
Come in and don't go
Be quick don't be show
Won't you say please
Free and release
Shout it with me

Is everybody happy
Is everybody fine
Is everybody ready
