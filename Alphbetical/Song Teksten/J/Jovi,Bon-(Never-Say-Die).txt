As we stood there older than the men
and younger than the boys (that's right)
we were as still as the wind
that blows on a hot August night

And you were lonesome
as a jukebox
but deadly just the same
I could be as gentle as a newborn
then spit into the eye of a hurricane

And we knew how to laugh
and we knew how to cry
yeah we sure knew how to live
but we don't ever

Never say die
never say die

I guess you'd say we had a pact
these words we knew so well (that's right)
still they remained unspoken
and we'd take them to the fiery
gates of hell

Once I was afraid of love
but when it's your brother
those things change
'cause love is just another word
for trust
so hear me when I say

Never say die
never say no
you got to look them in the eye
and don't let go
when it's your own blood you'll bleed
and your own tears you you'll cry
when you're brought up to believe
that it's the strong who survive
never say die

Solo

Yeah, and we could run like lightning
through the pouring rain
and we'll be standing like a soldier
who comes marching home again

They ask what it is that I want written
on the gravestone where I'll lie
tell them it's just my bones
that died there
so save the tears they'll cry

My spirit is still riding somewhere
somewheres in this night
when it's these three words that come to me
as I kiss this world goodbye

Never say die
never say no
you got to look them in the eye
and don't let go
when it's your own blood you'll bleed
and your own tears you you'll cry
when you're brought up to believe
that it's the strong who survive
never say die.
