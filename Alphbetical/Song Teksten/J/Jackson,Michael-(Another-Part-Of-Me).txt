MICHAEL JACKSON - ANOTHER PART OF ME

(Words & music: Michael Jackson)

We're taking over
We have the truth
This is the mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

We're sendin' out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you
(Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line
Waitin' for you
Can't you see?
You're just another part of me
