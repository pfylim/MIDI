She wasn't young, but still a child
there still was innocence
in painted smiles
she called to me as I passed her by
lady of the night looked in my eyes
she said: I been through some changes
but one thing always stays the same.

Without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else can get through the night
nothing else feels right without love.

I saw a man down on lonely street
a broken man who looked like me
and no one knows the pain that he's been living
he lost his love and still hasn't forgiven
he said: I've been through some changes
but one thing always atays the same.

Without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else can get you through the night
nothing else feels right without love
there's nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn  as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love.

I see my life
there's somethings I took for granted
love's passed me by
so many second chances
I was afraid
but I won't be afraid no more.

Without love, there's nothing without love
nothing else can get you through the night
nothing else feels right without love
there's nothing without love
nothing else but love can burn  as bright
and nothing would mean nothing without love.
