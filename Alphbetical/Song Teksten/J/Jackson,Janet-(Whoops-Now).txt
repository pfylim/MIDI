13. WHOOPS NOW - JANET JACKSON

Friday morning when all my work is done 
I pack my bags I'm on the run
I've got a feeling
That I'm going to have some fun
In the sun with my friends
And it's got me going.

Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Sorry I can't
Sorry I can't go now

Friday noon and the boss is on the phone
He's telling me that I can't leave home
An extra hand at work
Is what he called for 
He says we need you here
Tell your friends you're not going

Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
I don't know why Jarvis called me here
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
I don't know why Jarvis called me.

It makes no difference
If you love work or not
To dream your weekend
Hand on the door
Now out with your friends having fun
In the fun and that's when the phone rings

Friday evening and I'm alone at home
I know my friends are having fun 
On th weekend
I'm gonna leave the machine on
Next time he calls
He'll hear my voice 
Singing loud and clear

Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
Whoops Now, sorry I can't go
I'm out having fun in the sun
With my friends.
(Repeat)

Whoops now, sorry I can't go
With my friends, with my friends, with my friends.

With Ann and Rusty
Dean and Moody
Ken and Nancy
Lynette and Tony
Lisa and Jimmy
Ken and Julie
Kim and Josie
Bubbles and Michael
Ken and Terry
John and Kevin.
