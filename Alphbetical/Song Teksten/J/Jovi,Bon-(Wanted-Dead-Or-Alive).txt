It's all the same, only the names will change
everyday it seems we're wasting away
another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night
just to get back home.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive.

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
and people I meet always go their seperate ways
sometimes you tell the day
by the bottle that you drink
and times when you're all alone all you do is think.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive.

I walk these streets,
a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces
and I've rocked them all.

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
I'm wanted dead or alive
wanted dead or alive.
