Title  : COME BACK

(Words & music: Peter Wolf/Seth Justman)

When you left me all alone
You left me crying on my own
Tell me, tell me
What you're gonna do
Tell me, pretty baby
'Cause I'm still in love with you

Chorus:
Come back, baby
Come back, won't you come back to me?
Come back, baby
Come back, won't you come back to me?

Here I'm standing, such a fool
It's not like you, baby, oh, don't be cruel
Help me, help me
You know I'm not that strong
Help me, help me darling
I've been lonely far too long

Chorus: ...

Tell me, tell me what you're gonna do
