Title  : PAPA WAS A POOR MAN

He ain't got no money
He ain't got no job
But mama always felt so happy
'Cause papa was the best lookin' man who came around
Each day he came along, he sang a little song
He made that mama felt so happy
They've got a little son and papa got a
cradle down town

Yeah, I'm talking about papa
He was the poor richest man in town
I never saw a man who was so fine
Like papa he was the only friend of mine
Yeah papa he was the poor richest man in town
And when he brought some money on a saturday night
For mama the sunday was alright

He ain't got no house
He ain't got no car
But mama always felt so happy
'Cause papa was the only man who tried so hard
And when he had no food
Ma always understood
She smiled, she always felt so happy
For papa said tomorrow's there's another start
