Circle Of Life - Elton John


From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

Some say eat or be eaten
Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

Chorus:
In the circle of life
It's wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, in the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some of us have to live with the scars

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Thru the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small an the endless round

Chorus repeats
