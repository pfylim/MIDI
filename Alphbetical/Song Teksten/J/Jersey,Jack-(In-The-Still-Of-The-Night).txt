Title  : IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT

In the still of the night
I dream of you
My life is empty girl
I don't know what to do
I hear your footsteps
And I open my eyes
I'm all alone in my room
And you're not there little girl
To hold me tonight

Tomorrow is another day without you
I beg you please come home
for I need you
I feel so lonely
My love has gone
I'll give my love everyday
Oh, baby please hear my prayer
I'm alone

I'll change my life
Please come back home
I'll give my love everyday
Oh, baby please hear my prayer
I'm so alone

Tomorrow there's another day without you
I beg you please come home
for I need you
I feel so lonely
My love has gone
I'll give my love everyday
Oh, baby please hear my prayer
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
