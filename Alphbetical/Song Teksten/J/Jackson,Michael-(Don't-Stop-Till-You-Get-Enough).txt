(Words & music: Michael Jackson/Greg Phillinganes)

Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever temperatures risin' now
Power (ah power) is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks now questionns why (ooh)
So get closer (colser now) to my body now
Just love me 'til you don't know how (ooh)

Chorus:
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothin' like a love desire (ooh)
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Sensation (ah sensation) lovely where we're at (ooh)
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin' 'cause this is love and power (ooh)

Chorus: ...

Heartbreak enemy despice
Eternal (ah eternal) love shines in my eyes (ooh)
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin' (no, no)
'Cause your love is alright, alright

Chorus: ...

Lovely is the feeling now
I won't be complainin' (ooh, ooh)
The force is love power
