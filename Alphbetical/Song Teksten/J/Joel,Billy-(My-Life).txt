Singer : BILLY JOEL 
Title  : MY LIFE

(Words & music: Billy Joel)

Got a car from an old friend, wished it be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the West Coast
Now he gives them a stand up routine in L.A.

Chorus:
I don't need you to worry for me, 'cause I'm all right
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
Go ahead with your own life, leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong, don't get me wrong
You can speak your mind, but not on my time

They will tell you, you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you, you can't sleep with somebody else
Oh, but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way, it's o.k. you're mixed up with yourself

Chorus: ...

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong, don't get me wrong
You can speak your mind, but not on my time
