Can't see when the day is over
And all the people trying to forget about the trouble
Just to have some fun
Don't you know that just a kind of love is telling you
To believe when everything is just gone wrong.

Every time that we had to keep in stride and just another time lost
When love's gonna be that strong
So all I wanna give is just the way I live
Without another sense you're never gonna make it all night long.

Gotta sing it to you
Doodidoodoodoodoodoo...

Can't you see when the day is over
And all the people trying to forget about the trouble
Just to have some fun
Don't you know that just a kind of love is telling you
To believe when everything is just been wrong.

You, you make me feel the new
Again you say I'll do my love
You make me feel the way
I got to feel for you
So we we've only tried to see
But love is meant to be
To open up our eyes and start singing to you.

Doodidoo....

Everytime that we have to keep on trying
Just another time lost when love's gonna be this strong
So all I wanna give is just the way I live
Without another sense you're never gonna make it all night long.

Time I'm just another sign
To make you feel the way
I never felt until today
So love it's just the way we live
Oh I just can't forgive the way
That you were playing games
With me so hear me say it.

Doodidoo....

Oooh aah, you make me feel brand new
Oooh.....

Doodidoo....

Can't you see when the day is over
And all the people trying to forget about the trouble
Just to have some fun
Don't you know that just a kind of love is telling you
To believe when everything is just been wrong.

Doodidoo....
