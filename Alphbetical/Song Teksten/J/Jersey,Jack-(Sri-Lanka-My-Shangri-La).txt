Title  : SRI LANKA, MY SHANGRI-LA

(Words & music: Bastiaan/Jack de Nijs)

Sri Lanka, you are my shangri-la
Hidden in the sun
Recalling the land of my roots
When my life began
Sri Lanka, you are my shangri-la
From this moment on
Take me away in dreams to the place I've been born
Recall all my memories that nearly have been gone

I say, hey
This is a place I wanna stay
Me and my baby
I'm sure I don't mean maybe today
I say, oh
Wish all my old friends would know
I'm almost in heaven
Sri Lanka, so don't let me go, oh no

Sri Lanka, you are my shangri-la
A golden memory
Paradise, regained in the sun
Where I've found my key
Sri Lanka, I'll speak your Sinala from this moment on
And let me keep pretending
You're the isle where I've been born
Secret paradise
For dreamers like me on the run
