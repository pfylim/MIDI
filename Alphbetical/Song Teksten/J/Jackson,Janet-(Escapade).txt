ESCAPADE - JANET JACKSON


As I was walkin' by
Saw you standin' there
With a smile

Lookin' shy
You caught my eye
Thought you'd want to hang
For a while

Well I'd like to be with you
And you know it's Friday too
I hope you can find the time
This weekend
to relax and unwind

My mind's tired
I've worked so hard all week
cashed my check
I'm ready to go
I promise you
I'll show you such a good time

Come on baby let's get away
Let's save our troubles
for another day
Come go with me we've got it made
Let me take you on a
escapade(let's go)

Es-ca-pade we'll have a good time
Es-ca-pade leave our worries behind
Es-ca-pade you can be mine
Es-ca-pade an escapade

So don't hold back
Just have a good time
We'll make the rules up
As we go along
And break them all
If we're not havin' fun

My mind's tired I've worked
So hard all
Worked so hard all week
I just got paid
we've got it made
Ready to go
I promise you I'll show you
Such a good time
