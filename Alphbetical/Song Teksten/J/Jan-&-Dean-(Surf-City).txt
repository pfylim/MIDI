Title  : SURF CITY

(Words & music: Brian Wilson/Jan Berry)

Two girls for ev'ry boy
I bought a thirty-four wagon and we call it a woody
Surf City, here we come!
You know it's not very cherry as an oldie, but a goody
Surf City, here we come!
Well it ain't got a back seat or a rear window
But it still gets me where I wanna go

Chorus:
I'm goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know I'm goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Yeah, I'm goin' to Surf City, 'cause it's two to one
You know I'm goin' to Surf City, gonna have some fun
Two girls for ev'ry boy

They say they never roll the streets up
'Cause there's always something going
Surf City, here we come
They're either out surfin' or they got a party goin'
Surf City here we come
There's two swinging honey's for ev'ry guy
And all you gotta do is just wink your eye

Chorus: ...

And if my woody breaks down on me
Somewhere on my surfroute
Surf City, here we come
I'll strap my board to my back 
And hitch a ride in my wet suit
Surf City, here we come
When I get to Surf City I'll be shootin' the curl
And checkin' out the parties for that surfer girl

Chorus: ...
