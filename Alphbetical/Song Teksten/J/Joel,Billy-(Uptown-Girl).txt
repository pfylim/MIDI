Uptown girl she's been living in her uptown world
I bet she never had a backstreet guy.
I bet her mama never told her why.
I'm gonna try for an uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world
as long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man.
That's what I am.
And when she knows what she wants from her time
and when she wakes up and makes up her mind
she'll see I'm not to tough just because I'm in love
with an uptown girl.
You know I've seen her in her uptown world
she's getting tired of her high class toys
and all her presents from her uptown boys.

She's got a choice oh oh uptown girl
you know I can't afford to buy her pearls
but maybe someday when my ship comes in
she'll understand what kind of guy I've been
and then I'll win
and when she's walking she's looking so fine
and when she's talking she'll say that she's mine.

She'll say I'm not so tough
just because I'm in love with an uptown girl
she's been living in her white bread world.
As long as anyone with hot blood can
and now she's looking for a downtown man.
That's what I am oh oh.

Uptown girl she's my uptown girl
you know I'm in love with an uptown girl
my uptown girl you know I'm in love with an
uptown girl.
