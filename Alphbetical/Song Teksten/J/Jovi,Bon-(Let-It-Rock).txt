The weekend comes to this town
seven days too soon
for the ones who have to make up
what we break up of their rules.

Well I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset
tell his boys they're in command
while Chino danced a tango
with a broomstick in his hand
he said: it's alright (alright) if you have a good time
it's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line
to break on through the other side.

Let it rock, let it go
you can't stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock, let it go
with the night you're on the loose
you got to let it rock.

We go down to the broadway
where everybody goes
to get on their rockin' horse
and blast that radio
well I saw Roxie on the table
her girlfriend down below
they'll give it to the king of swing
before it's time to go.

They said: it's alright (alright) if you have a good time
it's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line
to break on through the other side.

Let it rock, let it go
you can't stop a fire burning out of control
let it rock, let it go
with the night you're on the loose
you got to let it rock.
