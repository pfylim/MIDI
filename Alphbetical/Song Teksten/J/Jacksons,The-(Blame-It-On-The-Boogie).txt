Singer : THE JACKSONS 
Title  : BLAME IT ON THE BOOGIE

(Words & music: M. Jackson/D. Jackson/E. Krohn)

My baby's always dancing
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye

Chorus:
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Chorus: ...

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm get me
On my feet

I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me

Chorus: ...

I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet (4x)

Chorus: ...

This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten in me
Through this dance

I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in 
A super trance

Chorus: ...

Sunshine, moonlight, good times, boogie
Sunshine, moonlight, good times, boogie

Don't you blame it
You just got to
You just want to
Yeah
Blame it on yourself
Ain't nobody's fault
But yours and that boogie
Dancing all night long
Yours and that boogie
Ain't nobody's fault
But yours
Dancing all night long
