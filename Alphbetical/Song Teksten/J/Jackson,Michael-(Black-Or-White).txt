   BLACK OR WHITE          Michael Jackson

I took my baby
on a saturday Bang
boy is that girl with you
yes we're on and the same

now I believe in miracles
and a miracle
has happened tonight

but, if
you're thinking
about my baby
it don't matter if you're
black or white

they print my message
in the saturday sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

and I told about equality
and it's true
either you're wrong
or you're white

but, if
you're thinkin'
about my baby
I don't matter if you're
black or white

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
sew when the
goin gets rough
I ain't scared of
your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
girl when the
goin' gets mean

protection
for gangs, clubs,
and nations
cousing grief in
human relations
it's a turf war
on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides
of the tale
see, it's not about races
just places
faces
where youre blood
comes from
is where your space is
I've seen the bright
get duller
I'm not going to spend
my life being a color

don't tell me to agree
with me
when I saw you
kicking dirt in my eye

but, if
you're thinkin'
about my baby
it don't matter if you're
black or white
          
I said if
you're thinkin' of
being my baby
it don't matter if you're
black or white

I said if
you're thinkin' of
being my brother
it don't matter if you're
black or white

ooh, ooh
yea, yea, yea now
ooh, ooh
yea, yea, yea now

it's black, it's white
it's tough for them
to get by
it's black, it's white, whoo

it's black, it's white
it's tough for them
to get by
it's black, it's white, whoo
