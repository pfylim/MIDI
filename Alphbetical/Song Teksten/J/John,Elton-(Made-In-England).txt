I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And a black piano
On that Sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo.

Wow oh oh oh I was made in England
Wow oh oh oh I was made in England

I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying God send me a brother
Not a bloody nose
For Rock & Roll
Gimme that Sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo

Wow oh oh oh I was made in England
Wow oh oh oh I was made in England

I was made in England
Like a blue cortina
But a yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well her's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to.

Wow oh oh oh I was made in England
Wow oh oh oh I was made in England

If you're made in England
You're built to last
You can still say homo
And everybody laughs
But the joke's on you
You never read the song
They all think they know
But the've all got it wrong.

Wow oh oh oh I was made in England
Wow oh oh oh I was made in England
