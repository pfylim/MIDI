Title  : CHUCK E.'S IN LOVE

(Words & music: Rickie Lee Jones)

How come he don't come and p.l.p. with me
Down at the meter no more?
How come he turn off the t.v.
And hang that sign on the door?
We call and we call, how come? we say
Hey what could make a boy behave this way?

Well he learn all of the lines
And every time he don't stutter when he talk
And it's true, it's true
He sure is acquired a cool and inspired sorta jazz
When he walk
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
If this ain't healthy, it is some kinda clean?

That means Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in

I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something I gotta see
Is he here?
Look in the pool hall
Well, is he here?
Look in the drugstore
I Look in the drugstore
Is he here
No, he don't come here no more

I'll tell you what, I saw him
He was sittin' behind us, down at the Pantages
And whatever it is that he's got up his sleeve
I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name?
Is that here there?
Oh, Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
Is that her
What's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E.'s in love with the little girl
Who's singing this song

Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
Chuck E.'s in love
With me
