JANET JACKSON - WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY

Used to be a time when you would pamper me
You still brag about it all the time
Your friend seem to think that you're so peachy keen
But my friends think neglect is on your mind

REFRAIN:
What have you done for me lately
Ooh yeah
What have you done for me lately
Ooh yeah

Used to go to dinner almost every night
Dancing till I thought I'd lose my breath
Now it seems your dancing feet are always on my couch
Good thing I cook or else we'd starve to death

REFRAIN: ...

I never ask for more than I deserve
You know it's the truth
You seem to think you're God's gift to this earth
No way

You ought to be thankful for the little things
But little things are all you seem to give
You're always putting off what we could do today
Soap opera says you got one life to live
Who's right - who's wrong

REFRAIN: ...
