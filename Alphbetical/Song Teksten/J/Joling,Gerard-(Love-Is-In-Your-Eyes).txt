GERARD JOLING - LOVE IS IN YOUR EYES

Refrain:
Love is in your eyes
And someone's gonna love you tonight now
Love is in your eyes
And someone's gonna hold you right now

We don't have to dance in silence
You don't have to be so blue
I feel that you're out of balance
But there's a life waiting for you

Refrain: ...

You're just going through the motions
I know that it cuts like a knife
But I'll second your emotions
We'll go for the bright sight of life

Refrain: ...
