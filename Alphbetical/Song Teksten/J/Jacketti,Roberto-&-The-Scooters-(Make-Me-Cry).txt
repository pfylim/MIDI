ROBERTO JACKETTI & THE SCOOTERS - MAKE ME CRY

Mondaynight I saw her passing by
And when she smiles oh she made me sigh
She broke my heart but I'm goin' on
I love that woman 'cause she's oh so strong

Is she really gonna say
That she's really goin' out with me
Do I really have a chance
That she'll take me home

Am I really gonna dance with her
Do I really stand a chance with her
I wonder what we're gonna do
When she'll take me home

Refrain:
And if she say that she loves me
Well you know she can make me cry

And if she say that she loves me
Well you know she can make me cry

I never thought I would be doing like this
Doing the dishes and I never get kissed
Well I'm here but I'm feeling alone
I need a woman when I'm on my own

Is she really going out
Is she really gonna take me home
Does she really have a plan
When she'll take me home

I will buy that diamond ring for her
I will try to write a song for her
I will do a million things
When she'll take me home

Refrain: ...
