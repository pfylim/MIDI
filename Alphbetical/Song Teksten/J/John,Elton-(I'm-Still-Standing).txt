Title  : I'm Still Standing
Singer : Elton John


You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes
Just like ice and there's cold
Lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like
The wreck you hide
Behind that mask you use

And did you think
This fool could never win
Well look at me
I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love
In a simple way
And if you need to know
While I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know, I'm still standing
Better than I ever did
Lookin' like a true survivor
Feelin' like a little kid
I'm still standing
After all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life
Without you on my mind

I'm still standing, yea yea yeah (2x)

Once I could never hope to win
You starting down the road
Leaving me again
The threats you made
Were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus
You'd be a clown by now


Words & Music : Elton John, Bernie Taupin
