So much for your promises
They died the day
   you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it waqs just too late
   to know
I thought it was you
Who would stand by my side
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: And now you've given me given me
         Nothing but shattered dreams
            shattered dreams
         Feel like I could run away
            run away
         From this empty heart
--------------------------------------------------------
You said you'd die for me
--------------------------------------------------------
Woke up to reality
And found the future
   not so bright
I dream the impossible
That maybe things
   could work out right
I thought it was you
Who would do me no wrong
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: ...
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: ...
--------------------------------------------------------
From this empty heart
--------------------------------------------------------
I thought it was you
Who said they'd die for love
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: ...
--------------------------------------------------------
REFRAIN: ...
--------------------------------------------------------
Oh no no no no
You said you'd die for me
So much for your promises
So much for your promises
