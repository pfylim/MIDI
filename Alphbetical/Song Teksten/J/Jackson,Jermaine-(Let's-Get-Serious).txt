Title  : LET'S GET SERIOUS

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder/Lee Garrett)

Close my eyes and I see your face at night
Toss and turn fall to sleep holdin' my pillow tight
All the time I think of you
You're with me no matter what I do
Walk around with a smile upon my face
In my mind you have taken a permanent space
Now my life is filled with nothing less
Let your sweet love carryin' tenderness

Chorus:
Let's get serious, let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love
Let's get serious, let's get serious
Let's get serious, and fall in love

Call my name and I lose all self-control
Touch my hand and I feel it deep down in my soul
I am feeling what I can't explain
It ain't what you feel it's just the same

Chorus: ...

In your arms is the place I wanna be
With my love in you and your love inside of me
Longing for each other just ain't fair
When we got so much we want to share

Chorus: ...

Night is young
But not quite too young for you and me
Let's be one (be one)
Let our bodies travel with our minds
To a place where love will always shine

Chorus: ...
