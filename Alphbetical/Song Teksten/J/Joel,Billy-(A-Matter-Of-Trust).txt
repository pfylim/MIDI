One, two, one, two, three, four.
Some love is just a lie of the heaert.
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start.
And they may not want it to end
but it will, it's just a question of 
when I've lived long enough to have learned.
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned.
But that won't happen to us 
because it's always been a matter of trust.

I know you're an emotional girl
it took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world.
I can offer you proof.
But you've gonna face a moment of truth.
It's hard when you're always afraid.
You just recover when another belief is betrayed.
So break my heart if you must
it's a matter of trust.

You cant go the distance with too much resistance
I know you have doubts but for god's sake don't shut me out.

This time you've got nothing to lose
you can take it, you can leave it whatever you choose.
I won't hold back anything
and I'll walk away a fool or a king 
some love is just a lie of the mind.
It's make believe until it's only a matter of time.
And some might have learned to adjust
but then it never was a matter of trust.

I'm sure you're aware love we've both had our share
of believing too long when the whole situation was wrong.

Some love is just  a lie of the soul
a constant battle for the ultimate state of control
after you've heard lie upon lie
there can hardly be a question of why
some love is just a lie of the heart
the cold remains of what began with a passionate start.
But that can't happen to us
because it's always been a matter of trust.

It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust.
It's a matter of trust
It's always been a matter of trust.
