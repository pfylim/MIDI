Title  : DON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME

I can't light no more of our darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life
Too late to save myself from falling
I took a change and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blind by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of our life to wander free

But losin' ev'rything is like
The sun is goin' down on me
I can't find oh the right romantic line
But see me once
And see the way I feel
Don't discard me
Just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have
Oh, they need love
To help them heal
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of our life to wander free
But losin' ev'ryting is like
The sun is goin' down on me
