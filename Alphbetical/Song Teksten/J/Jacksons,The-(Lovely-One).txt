Title  : LOVELY ONE
Artist : THE JACKSONS

(Words & music: Michael Jackson/Randy Jackson)

Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
You wear the face that tells me
You think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire
I get highter everytime I speak your name
That's all I do
And the way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through

Chorus:
Now the first time that I saw you
Walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love
When it's ;giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one
You are my, you are my, you are my lovely one

Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to please you
I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about
Living and hoping, but I'm coping
With these things you put me through
That's all I do
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you

Chorus: ...
