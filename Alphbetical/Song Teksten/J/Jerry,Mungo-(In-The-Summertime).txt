  4. IN THE SUMMERTIME - MUNGO JERRY
  
  IN THE SUMMERTIME WHEN THE WEATHER IS HOT
  YOU CAN STRETCH RIGHT UP AND TOUCH THE SKY
  WHEN THE WEATHER'S FINE YOU'VE GOT WOMEN
  YOU'VE GOT WOMEN ON YOUR MIND
  
  HAVE A DRINK
  HAVE A DRIVE
  GO OUT AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND
  
  IF HER DADDY'S RICH TAKE HER OUT FOR A MEAL
  IF HER DADDY'S POOR JUST DO WHAT YOU FEEL
  SPEED ALONG THE LANE DO A TURN OR RE-TURN ON 25
  WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN YOU CAN MAKE IT BIG AND GOOD A LULLABY
  
  WE'RE NOT DRAG PEOPLE
  WE'RE NOT DIRTY
  WE'RE NOT MEAN
  WE LOVE EVERYBODY BUT WE DO AS WE PLEASE
  WHEN THE WEATHER'S FINE WE GO FISHING OR GO SWIMMING
  (RIGHT SAILING) IN THE SEA
  WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY 'CAUSE WE'RE LIVING NEAR THE SOUTH
  PHILOSOPHY
  
  SING ALONG WITH US DIDIDIDIDI
  DADADADADA YEAH WE'RE HAP HAP-PY
  DADADADA DIRADA DIRADA DADA
  DARADADADA DADADADADA
  ALLRIGHT
  
  WHEN THE WIND IS HERE YEAH IT'S A PARTY TIME
  BRING YOUR BOTTLE WAG YOUR BACK 'CAUSE IT'LL SOON
  BE SUMMERTIME
  AND WE'LL SING AGAIN WE'LL GO DRIVING OR MAYBE WE'LL
  SETTLE DOWN
  IF SHE'S RICH
  IF SHE'S ASKED BRING YOUR FRIENDS
  AND WE'LL ALL GO INTO TOWN
  (REPEAT FROM THE BEGINNING)
