Title  : ONE DAY IN YOUR LIFE
Artist : MICHAEL JACKSON

(Words & music: Samuel F. Brown III/Renee Armand)

One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will say in your heart
and when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
When you find that you're always waiting
For the love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there

You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For the love we used to share
Just call my name
And I'll be there
