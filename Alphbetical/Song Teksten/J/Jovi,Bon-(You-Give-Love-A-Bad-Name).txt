BON JOVI - YOU GIVE LOVE A BAD NAME

(Words & music: J. Bon Jovi/R. Sambora/D. Child)

Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling you give love a bad name

The angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven you put me through hell
The chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison you can't break free
Oh oh you're a loaded gun yeah
Oh oh there's nowhere to run
No one can save me the damage is done

Refrain:
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (bad name)
Yeah you give love a bad name

Paint your smile on your lips
Blood'red nails on your fingertips
A schoolboy's dream you act so shy
You very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye
Oh oh you're a loaded gun
Oh oh there's nowhere to run
No one can save me the damage is done

Refrain: ...
