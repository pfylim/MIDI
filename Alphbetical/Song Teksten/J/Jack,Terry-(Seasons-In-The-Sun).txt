11. SEASONS IN THE SUN - TERRY JACKS

Intro: 

Vers 1:
Good bye to you, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were nine or ten
Together we've climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and A-B-C's, skinned our hearts and skinned our knees.
Good bye, my friend, it's hard to die,
When all the birds are singing in the sky.
Now that the spring is in the air,
Pretty girls are ev'rywhere, think of me and I'll be there.

1. Refrain:
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time.

Vers 2:
Goodbye Papa, please pray for me,
I was the black sheep of the family.
You tried to teach me right from wrong.
Too much wine and too much song, wonder how I got along.
Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky.
Now that the spring is in the air,
Little children ev'rywhere, when you'll see them I'll be there.

2. Refrain:
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone.

3. Refrain: 
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone.

Vers 3:
Goodbye Michelle, my little one,
You gave me love and help me find the sun.
And ev'ry time that I was down,
You would always come around  and get my feet back on the ground.
Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky.
Now that the spring is in the air
With the flowers ev'rywhere, I wish that we could both be there.

4. Refrain:
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach.

5. Refrain: 
We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone

6. Refrain:
All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,
But the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time.

Fade away
