If you could see inside my heart
then you would understand
I'd never mean to hurt you
baby I'm not that kind of man.

I might not say i'm sorry
yeah I might talk tough sometimes
and I might forget the little things 
ot keep you hanging on the line.

In a world that don't know Romeo & Juliet
boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
we are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry.

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
i'd do anything
I'd lie for you
you know it's true
baby I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know it's true
baby I'd die for you.

I might not be a savior
and I'll never be a king
I might not send you roses
or buy you diamond rings.

But if  I could see inside you
maybe I'd know just who we are
'cause our love is like a hunger
without it we would starve

In a world that don't know Romeo & Juliet
boy meets girl and promises we can't forget
we are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets
into the fire we cry.

I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
i'd do anything
I'd lie for you
you know it's true
baby I'd die for you
I'd die for you
I'd cry for you
if it came right down to me and you
you know it's true
baby I'd die for you.
