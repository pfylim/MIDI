Well we all have a face
that we hide away forever
and we take them out and show ourselves
when everyone has gone some are satin,
some are steel, some are silk and some are leather
they're the faces of the stranger
but we love to try them on.

Well we all fall in love
but we disregard the danger
though we share so many secrets
there are some we never tell
why were you so surprised
that you never saw the stranger 
did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself.

Don't be afraid to try again
everyone goes sough everynow and then woo, woo
you've done it, why can't someone else
you should know by now
you've been there yourself
once I used to believe I was such a great romancer
then I came home to a woman that I could not recognized
when I pressed her for a reason she refused to even answer
it was then I felt the stranger kick me right between the eyes.

Well we all fall in love
but we disregard the danger
though we share so many secrets
there are some we never tell
why were you so surprised
that you never saw the stranger 
did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself.

Don't be afraid to try again
everyone goes sough everynow and then woo, woo
you've done it, why can't someone else
you should know by now
you've been there yourself
you may never understand how the stranger is inspired
but he isn't  always evil
and he isn't always wrong
though you drown in good intentions
you will never quench the fire
you'll give in to your desire 
when the stranger comes along.
