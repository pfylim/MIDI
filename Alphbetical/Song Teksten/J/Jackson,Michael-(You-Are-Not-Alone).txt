13. YOU ARE NOT ALONE - MICHAEL JACKSON

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go 
And leave my world so cold.
Everyday I sit and ask myself 
How love did slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I'm here with you
Though you're far away
I'm here to stay
You are not alone 
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone...
All alone
Why oh,
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayer your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
So forever can begin
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there 
I'll be there
You are not alone...
