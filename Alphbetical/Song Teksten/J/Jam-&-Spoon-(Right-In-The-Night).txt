  RIGHT IN THE NIGHT (JAM&SPOON)
  
  Follow with music
  Follow with dance
  Follow with anything that makes you want romance
  Make a little softer round the way that it goes
  just think that everything you touch could turn in gold
  follow with everything like you would love to love
  you know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up
  so don't make me feel unpleasant like you do
  you know that everything will fall right back on you
  so follow with everything, follow the life
  get about your troubles and be a little nice
  you will not see me if you don't want to look
  just call me and get me in
  my big big better life
  
  Right in the night
  Right in the night
  Right in the night you'll find
  that if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love
  Right in the night
  Right in the night
  Sweet things is what you'll get
  When you fall in love, fall in love
  
  Follow the story is a fairy tale the truth
  innocence is the other way, illusion what you use
  show a little confidence show a little class
  don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last
  follow with passion follow with love
  follow with other things you're always dreaming of
  follow with music and you will get back
  
  Right in the night
  Right in the night
  Right in the night you'll find
  that if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love
  Right in the night
  Right in the night
  Sweet things is what you'll get
  When you fall in love, fall in love
