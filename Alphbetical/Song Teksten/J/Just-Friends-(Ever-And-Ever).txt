EVER AND EVER - Just Friends

Ever Ever Ever Ever and ever

Forever and ever and ever you'll hear me say
That I will never, no never no never forget this one perfect day
Forever and ever together we're going to stay
How can it be that you got me to feel this way

I know this score now
I don't play that crazy game
It's such a bore now
'Cos it'll always play the same
And then I hear it spoken: "sometimes I love you"
And I feel that it's real, that it's true

Refrain....

Thought I was free and
Thought I left all that behind
But look at me now
Let in heart win over mind
'Cos when I heard you say it "I'm hurt, I need you" 
So I swear, I'll be there close to you

Forever and ever and ever you hear me say
That I will never, no never no never forget this perfect day
forever and ever together we're going to stay
How can it be that you got me so happy feelin' this way

And I will never, no never deny
How it should be
Forever and ever together our destiny
Feelin' so fine, now that you're my true lover true harmony
Ever and Ever and Ever and ever
