TOM JONES & THE ART OF NOISE - KISS

(Words & music: Prince)

You don't have to be beautiful
To turn me on
I just need your body baby
From dusk till dawn
You don't need experience
To turn me out
You just leave it all up to me
I'll show you what's all about

Refrain:
You don't have to be rich
To be my girl
You don't have to be cool
To rule my world
Ain't no particular sign
I'm more compatible with
I just want you extra time
And your kiss

And maybe (baby) you could be mine
You just leave it all up to me
We can have a good time

Refrain: ...

Think I'd better dance now
(La la la)

Women and girls rule my world
I say they rule my world
Act your age mama (not your shoe size)
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty
To have an attitude
You gotta leave it all up to me
My love will be your food

Refrain: ...
