A whiskey bottle comforts me
and tells me not to cry
while a full moon says a prayer for me
I try to close my eyes

But the night's there to remind me
of the guns and the early graves
the ghosts appear as I fall asleep
to sing an outlaw's serenade

Dyin' ain't much of a livin' 
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that I have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

The desert's been a friend to me
it covers me by night
and a snakebite's not my enemy
but it taught me how to fight

All this fame don't bring you freedom
though it wears a thin disguise
when an outlaw is just a man to me
and a man has to die

Dyin' ain't much of a livin' 
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that I have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

Solo

And I hope someone will pray for me
when it's my turn to die...pray for me

Chorus:
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' 
when you're livin' on the run
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
is it too late to ask for forgiveness
for the things that I have done
dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young
