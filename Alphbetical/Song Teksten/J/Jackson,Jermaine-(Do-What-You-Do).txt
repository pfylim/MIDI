JERMAINE JACKSON - DO WHAT YOU DO

Why don't you do what you do
when you did what you did to me, ooh
Love was so good it filled up all my needs
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love sweet love

Why don't you say what you say
when you say what you said to anymore
Your eyes keeping lies so long goodbye close the door
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong
My love sweet love

Tell me something that I didn't do
Why does someone else have to pull you through
Did he steal you away like a thief in the night
Love like this must take flight

Why don't they play what they played
on the night you danced with me
Oooh remember the one we made love to endlessly
I was crazy for you, you were crazy for me
How could something so right go so wrong

Why don't you do what you do
when you did what you did to me, ooh
Do what you do when you did what you did to me
Do what you do when you did what you did to me
Do what you do when you did what you did to me
