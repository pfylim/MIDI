Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday come and trashed me out again.
I was only having fun
wasn't hurting anyone
and we all enjoyed the weekend for a charge.
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
even rode my motorcycle in the rain
and you told me not to drive
but I made it home alive
so you said that only proves that I'm insane
you may be right I may be crazy.
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.
Turn out the light don't try to save me
you may be wrong for all I know
but you may be right.

Remember how I found you there
alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled.
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoyed some madness for a while.
Now think of all the years you tried to find someone
to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
if I'm crazy then it's true
that it's all because of you
and you wouldn't want me any other way
you may be right I may be crazy.
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.
It's too late to fight
it's too late to change me
you may be wrong for all I know
but you may be right
you may be right.

I may be crazy.
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.
Turn out the light don't try to save me
you may be wrong for all I know
but you may be right.
You may be wrong  but you may be right
you may be wrong  but you may be right.
