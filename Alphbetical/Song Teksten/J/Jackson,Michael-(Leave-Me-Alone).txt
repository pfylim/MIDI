MICHAEL JACKSON - LEAVE ME ALONE

Ow ah hoo-ooh
Ah ah ah I don't care what you talkin' about baby
Ah I don't care what you say
Ah don't you come walking back in now mama
Ah I don't care anyway
Ah ah ah time after time gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ah ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is going my way

refrain:
Ah 'cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight
Who's laughing baby
Don't you know
Ah and there's the choice you must make
And this choice you will take
Who's laughing baby
So just leave me alone
(Leave me alone leave me alone)

Leave me alone (leave me alone)

Ah but who is sorry now
