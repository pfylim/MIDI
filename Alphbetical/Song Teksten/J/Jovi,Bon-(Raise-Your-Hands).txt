You - you got a nasty reputation
we're in a sticky situation - it's down to me and you
so tell me - is it true...
they say there ain't nobody better
well now that we're together
show me what you can do
you're under the gun
out on the run
gonna set the night on fire
you're out on the run
under the gun
and playin' to win
raise your hands
when you want to let it go
raise your hands
when you want to let a feeling show
raise your hands
from New York to Chicago
raise your hands
from New Jersey to Tokyo
raise your hands.

I - I've been out on the front line
where you'll go down if you waste time
they'll walk all over you
but I - I ain't here looking for surrender
I'll raisethe flag if you'll defend her
it's up to you
you're under the gun
out on the run
gonna set the night on fire
you're out on the run
under the gun
and playin' to win
raise your hands
when you want to let it go
raise your hands
when you want to let a feeling show
raise your hands
from New York to Chicago
raise your hands
from New Jersey to Tokyo
raise your hands.
