1 Strophe
F#m     G#m         A6     
She was more like a beauty queen 
       G#m
From a movie scene
F#m     G#m                 A6    
I said don't mind, but what do you mean 
G#m          Bm7
I am the one
                                   F#m G#m A6
Who will dance on the floor in the round
         G#m         Bm7
She said I am the one 
                                   F#m G#m A6 G#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round.
F#m         G#m          A6     
She told me her name was Billie Jean, 
       G#m
As she caused a scene
F#m        G#m              A6     
Then every head turned with eyes 
                G#m       Bm7
That dreamed of being the one
                                   F#m G#m A6 G#m
Who will dance on the floor in the round.

Bridge
D
People always told me 
   F#m
Be careful of what you do
          D                               F#m
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    D
And mother always told me 
   F#m
Be careful who you love
       D
And be careful of what you do 
           C#7
'Cause the lie becomes the truth, hey
 
Refrain
F#m    G#m     A6     G#m
Billie Jean is not my lover
F#m          G#m      A6          G#m          Bm7
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
                       F#m G#m A6 
But the kid is not my son.
         G#m      Bm7
She says I am the one, 
                      F#m G#m A6 G#m
But the kid is not my son

2 Strophe
F#m       G#m      A6       
For forty days and forty nights
    G#m
The law was on her side
F#m         G#m                   A6 
But who can stand when she's in demand
     G#m        Bm7
Her schemes and plans
                                     F#m G#m A6 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
        G#m         Bm7
So take my strong advice, 
                              F#m G#m A6 
Just remember to always think twice
         G#m
Do think twice
F#m         G#m        A6 
She told my baby we'd danced till three,
         G#m
Then she looked at me
F#m           G#m         A6 
Then showed a photo where baby cried 
    G#m                Bm7
His eyes were like mine.
                                     F#m G#m A6 G#m
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
 
Bridge
D                        F#m
People always told me be careful of what you do
          D                               F#m
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    D
She came and stood right by me
         F#m
Then the smell of sweet perfume
     D
This happened much too soon
    C#7
She called me to her room, hey
