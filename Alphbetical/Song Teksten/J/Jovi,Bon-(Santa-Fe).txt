They say that no man is an island
and good things come to those who wait
but the thing I hear are there
just to remind me
every dog will have his day

The spirits they intoxicate me
I watched them infiltrate my soul
they try to say it's too late for me
tell my guns I'm coming home

I swear I'm gonna live forever
tell my maker he can wait
I'm riding somewhere south of heaven
heading back to Santa Fe
it's judgement day in Santa Fe

Once I was promised absolution
there's only one solution for my sins
you got to face your ghosts and know
with no illusins
that only one of you is going home again

And I blame this world for making
a good man evil
it's this world that can drive a
good man mad
and it's this world that turns a killer
into a hero
well I blame this world for making
a good man bad

Now I ain't getting into heaven
if the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
heading back to Santa Fe
got debts to pay in Santa Fe
it's judgement day in Santa Fe

Solo

So I save a prayer
for when I need it most
to the father, son
and the Holy ghost
and sign it from a sinner
with no name

When I meet my maker
will he close the book
on the hearts I broke
and the lives I took
will he walk away
'cause my soul's
too late to save

Now I ain't getting into heaven
if the devil has his way
I swear I'm gonna live forever
heading back to Santa Fe
it's judgement day in Santa Fe.
