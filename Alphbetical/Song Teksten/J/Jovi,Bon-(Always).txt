2. Always - Bon Jovi

This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm that good anymore
But baby that's just me

1. Chorus:
Yeah, I will love you baby - always
And I'll be there forever
And a day - always
I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heaven burst
And the words don't rhyme
And I know when I die
You'll be on my mind
And I'll love you - always

Now your picture that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh
Some that made us cry
One that made
You have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my finger through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers
Try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he hold you close when he pulls you near
When he says the words
You've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him
Cause those words are mine
To say to you 'til the end of time

2. Chorus:
Yeah, I will love you baby - always
And I'll be there forever
And a day - always
If you told me
To cry for you, I could
If you told me
To die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But baby if you give me
Just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place
Where the sun still shines
