You can red it in the papers
in some places it comes in thirty-two flavors
but you wouldn't tell no one
your favorite if you could.

From the White House to the alleys
from the President down to Long Tall Sally
can't live with it but
you'll die without it-yes you would.

Senorita's in the kitchen
she's a fistful od dynamite
you call 911 but you
can't stop the fun tonight, it's alright.

You can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that I guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease.

Where you look you can find it
try to run but you're always behind it
so you play hide and seek like a blind kid
till you're caught-yeah you're caught.

Say you'll say that you had some
but they took it and held it for ransom
were they tall, dark, skinny or
handsome-you won't talk.

So telephone your doctor
just to see what pill to take
you know there's no prescripton
gonna wipe this one away.

You can't start a fire without a spark
but there's something that I guarantee
you can't hide when infection starts
Because love is a social disease.

So full of high grade octane
she could run the bullet train on 38 double d's
now you know for shure, you know the cure
to make a blind man see.
