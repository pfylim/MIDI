DON JOHNSON - TELL IT LIKE IT IS

(Words & music: G.Davis/L.Diamond)

If you want, something to play with
Go and find yourself a toy
Baby my time is too expensive
And I'm not a little boy

If you, are serious
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious
But if you want me to love you
Then baby I will, girl you know I will

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, that your conscious be your guide
Oh I know, deep down inside of me
I believe that you love me
Forget your foolish pride

Life is short to have sorrow
You may be here today and gone tomorrow
You might as well get what you want
So go on and live, baby go on and live

Tell it like it is
I'm not to play with, go and find yourself a toy
Tell it like it is
My time is too expensive and I'm not a little boy

(Sax solo)

Tell it like it is
Don't be ashamed, that your conscious be your guide
Oh I know, deep down inside of me
I believe that you love me
Forget your foolish pride

(Tell it like it is)

Got to tell it, tell it, ooh
Forget your foolish pride
Gotta believe that you love me
Don't play with my heart
Baby, baby, baby
