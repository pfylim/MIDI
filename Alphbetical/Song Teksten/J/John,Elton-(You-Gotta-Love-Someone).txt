You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky.
You can break the rules, but before you try.
You gotta love someone, you gotta love someone.

You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon.
You can beat the clock but before highnoon.
You gotta love someone, you gotta love someone.

You've got one life with a reason, you need two hearts on one side.
When you stand alone and there's no one there.
To share the way it feels inside and baby.

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun.
Burn up the Highway but before you run.
You gotta love someone, you gotta love someone.

When your gonna play with fire, you let somone share the heat.
When your on your own and there's no one there.
To cool the flames beneath your feet - and baby.

You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky.
You can break the rules but before you try.
You gotta love someone, you gotta love someone.

You gotta love someone, you gotta love someone.
