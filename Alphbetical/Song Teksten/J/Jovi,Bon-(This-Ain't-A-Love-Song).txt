I should have seen it coming when the roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said goodnight
You really meant goodbye
Baby it ain't funny, how you never learn to fall
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are "know-it-all" and I played that fool for you.

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you is gone 
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Baby, I thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But, we're just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us baby
Now it's sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving
If the love that I got for you is gone 
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny that your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I got for you is gone 
If the river I cried ain't that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

If the pain that I'm feeling so strong,
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - This ain't a love song

If the pain that I'm feeling so strong,
Is the reason that I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - This ain't a love song
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - This ain't a love song
