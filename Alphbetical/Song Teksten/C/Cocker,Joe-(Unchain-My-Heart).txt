       Unchain my heart         Joe Cocker 


Unchain my heart babe let me be
Cause you don't care so please set me free

Unchain my heart baby let me go
Unchain my heart cause you don't love me no more
Evry time I call you on the phone
Some fellow tells me that you're not at home
Unchain my heart please set me free

Unchain my heart baby let me be
Unchain my heart cause you don't care about me
you got me solo like a hallow case
But you let my love go away
Unchain my heart set me free

I'm under your spell like a man in a trance babe
OH but you know damn well that I don't stand the chance
Unchain my heart let me go my way 
Unchain my heart you worry me night and day

Why lead me through a life of misery 
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart please , set me free girl

Oh my... 

Solo

I'm under your spell like a man in a trance babe
Oh but you know damn well that I don't stand the chance
Please unchain my heart let me go my way
Unchain my heart you worry me night and day

Why lead me through a life of misery 
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart please set me free
Oh set me free ...

Why don't you do that for me ...
You don't care ...
Won't you let me go ...
When you don't love me nomore ...
Like a man in a trance ...
Let me go ...
