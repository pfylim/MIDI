Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you,
you take my heart into everything you do.
And it makes me sad for the lonely people,
I walked that road for so long.
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people,
your love is making me strong.

Had enough bad love, I need something
I can be proud of.
Had enough bad love, no more bad love.

And now I see that my that my life has been so blue,
with all the heartaches I had till I met you.
But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me,
with you here by myside.
And there's no more memories to remind me,
your love will keep me alive.

Had enough bad love, I need something
I can be proud of.
Had enough bad love, no more bad love.

Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you,

Had enough bad love, I need something
I can be proud of.
Had enough bad love, no more bad love.

I've had enough bad love, I need something
I can be proud of.
Had enough bad love, no more bad love.

Had enough bad love, I need something
I can be proud of.
Had enough bad love, no more bad love.
