FANTASY - Mariah Carey

When you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flows through my mind
But it's just a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
on and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's a sweet sweet fantasy baby
Images of rapture 
Creep into me slowly
As you're goin' to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's a
Sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
on and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's a sweet sweet fantasy baby
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning there's no end
Feels like I'm dreaming but I'm not sleeping

It's just a sweet sweet fantasy baby
When I close my eyes
You come and you take me
on and on and on
It's so deep in my daydreams
But it's a sweet sweet fantasy baby
