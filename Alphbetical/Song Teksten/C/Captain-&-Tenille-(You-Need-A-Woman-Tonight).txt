Title  : YOU NEED A WOMAN TONIGHT

(Words & music: Dana Merino)

You need a woman, need a woman tonight
You were lookin' to your left, you were lookin' to your right
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

I got this feeling, got this feeling inside
I'm not lookin' to run, I'm not lookin' to hide
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

Chorus:
Oh and it's on a lonely night
When a man needs a woman to love
And a woman to feel
And a woman to hold tight
Oh it's on a lonely night
No man can do it all alone
He needs to find a guidin' light
And you know, it takes two to tango
You know, it takes two to tango

You need a woman, need a woman right now
I'm not tellin' no lies, you need a lady and how
You need a woman tonight, you need a lover so right
You need a woman tonight

Chorus: ...2x...
