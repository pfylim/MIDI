
7. J.Cocker - Have A Little Faith

When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark
Have a little faith in me.

When the tears you cry
Are all you can believe
Give these lovin' arms
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

When your secret heart
Cannot speak so easily
From a whisper start
To have a little faith in me

And when your back's against the wall
just turn around and you will see
I will catch your fall
Have a little faith in me

Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me
Have a little faith in me

Solo

When the road gets dark
And you can no longer see
Let my love throw a spark
Have a little faith in me.

Have a little faith in me.
Have a little faith in me.
Have a little faith in me.
Have a little faith in me.

I've been loving for such a long time
Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me.
You know time, time is our friend
I will hold you up
Your love gives me strenght enough.

Have a little faith in me.
