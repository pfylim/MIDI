COMMODORES - NIGHTSHIFT

Marvin he was a friend of mine
And he could sing a song
His heart in every line
Marvin sang of the joy and pain
He opened up our minds
And I still can hear him say
Oh talk to me so you can see what's goin' on
Say you will sing your song for evermore

Refrain:
Gonna be some sweet sound
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
Oh I bet you pull a crowd

Gonna be a long night
It's gonna be alright on the nightshift
You found another home
I know you're not alone on the nightshift
You've found another home
I know you're not alone on the nightshift

Jackie hey what you're doin' now
It seems like yesterday
When we're working out
And Jackie oh you set the world on fire
You come and gifted us
Your love it lifted us higher and higher
Keep it up and we'll be there at your side
Oh say you will sing your song for evermore
evermore

Refrain: ...

Gonna be a long night
Gonna be alright on the nightshift
You've found another home
I know you're not alone, on the nightshift

Refrain: ...

Gonna be some sweet sounds
Coming down on the nightshift
I bet you're singing proud
I bet you pull a crowd
