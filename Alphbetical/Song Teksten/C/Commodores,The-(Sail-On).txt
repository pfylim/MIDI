Title  : SAIL ON

(Words & music: Lionel Richie)

Sail on down the line, 'bout a, half a mile or so
And a, don't really wanna know, where you're going
Maybe once or twice, you see, time after time I tried
But a, to hold on  to what we got but a
Now you're going

And I don't mind about the things you're gonna say, Lord
I gave all my money and my time
I know it's a shame, but I'm giving you back your name
Yeah, yeah, yes I'll be on my way, I won't be back to stay
I guess I move along, I'm looking for a good time

Sail on down the line, ain't it funny how the time can go on a
Friends say they told me so, But it doesn't matter
It was plain to see that a small town boy like me
Just a, wasn't your cup of tea
I was wishfull thinking
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
And you gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say: would you please just go away
Yeah, yeah, I've thrown away the blues, I'm tired of being used
I want everyone to know I'm looking for a good time
Good time

Sail on honey good times never felt so good (3x)
