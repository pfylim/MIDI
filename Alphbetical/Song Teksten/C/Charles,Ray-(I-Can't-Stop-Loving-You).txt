3. I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU - RAY CHARLES

Refrain:
Chor: I can't stop loving you
Ray:  I've made up my mind 
To live in memory .. of the lonesome times 
Chor: I can't stop wanting you
Ray:  It's useless to say 
So I'll just live my life in dreams of yesterday 
Chor: In dreams of yesterday!

Vers 1 (Ray allein):
Those happy hours that we once knew 
Though long ago-o-o they still make me blue
They say that time heals a broken heart 
But time has stood sti-i-ill since we've been apart

Refrain:
Chor: I can't stop loving you 
Ray:  I've made up my mind 
To live in memory of the lonesome times 
Chor: I can't stop wanting you 
Ray:  It's useless to say 
So I just live my life in dreams of yesterday 

Vers 2 (wie Vers 1, aber Dialog Chor - Ray):
Chor: Those happy hours   Ray: Those happy hours
Chor: That we once knew   Ray: That we once knew
Chor: So long ago-o-o     Ray: So long ago-o-o
Chor: Still make me blue  Ray: Still ma-ake me blue
Chor: They say that time  Ray: They say-ay that time.
