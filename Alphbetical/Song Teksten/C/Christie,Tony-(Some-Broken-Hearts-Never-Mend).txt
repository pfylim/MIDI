  12. SOME BROKEN HEARTS NEVER MEND - TONY CHRISTIE
  
  Coffee black  Cigarette
  Starts this day Like all the rest
  First thing every morning that I do
  Start missing you.
  
  Some broken hearts never mend  Some memories never end
  Some tears will never cry  My love for you will never die.
  
  Rendez-vous in the night
  A willing woman to hold me tight
  But in the middle of love's embrace
  I see your face.
