
6. LONDON'S BURNING - CLASH

London's burnin'
London's burnin'

All across the town
All across the night
Everybody is drivin' with the full headlight
Black or white, you turn it on you face a new religion
Everybody's sittin'round, watchin' Television
London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine
London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine

Up and down the Westway
In and out the light
Watta great traffic system
It's so bright
I can't think a better way to spend the night
Than speedin' around underneath the yellow lights
London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine
London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine

Now I'm in the subway
and I'm lookin' for a flat
This one leads to this block
This one leads to that
the wind howls through the empty block, lookin' for a home
I run through the empty stone, 'cos I'm all alone

London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine
London's burnin', with boredom now 
London's burnin' dial, nine nine nine nine nine

London's burnin'
