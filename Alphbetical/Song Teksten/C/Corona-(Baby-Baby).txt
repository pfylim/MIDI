Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.

I wanna roll inside your soul
To know the things that you need and feel
Every time that you're by my side
I can't get serious, because you got me.

Cold chill down my spine
No more tears, show me a smile

Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.

Deep inside I know you need it
Just let it out and get it on, you gotta feel it
Every time that you're by my side
Just think it over, I'll make it glad

Cold chill down my spine
No more tears, show me a smile
Cold chill down my spine
No more tears, show me a smile

Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.

Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby
Baby baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
Baby, baby, why can't we just stay together, yeh, yeh, yeh.
