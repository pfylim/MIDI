  1. ACHY BREAKY HEART - BILLY RAY CYRRUS
  
  You can tell the world
  You never was my brother
  You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
  Oh, you can tell your friends
  Just what a fool I've been
  And laugh and joke about me on the phone.
  
  You can tell my arms
  Go back into the farm
  You can tell my feet
  To hit the floor
  Oh, you can tell my lips
  To tell my fingertips
  They won't be reaching out
  For you no more.
  
  Don't tell my heart  My achy breaky heart
  I just don't think   He'd understand
  And if you tell my heart My achy breaky heart
  He might blow up  And kill this man.
  Ooh.
  
  You can tell your ma
  I moved to Arkansaw
  Oh, you can tell your dog
  About my leave
  Or tell your brother Cliff
  Whose fist can tear my lip
  He never really liked me anyway.
  
  Oh, tell your analyst
  Tell anything you please
  Myself already knows I'm not OK
  Oh, you can tell my eyes
  To watch out for my mind
  It might be walking out on me today
