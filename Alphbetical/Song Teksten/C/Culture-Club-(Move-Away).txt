CULTURE CLUB - MOVE AWAY

Movin' movin' move away

Spirits change the conversation
Stepping stones across the land
I never wanted to be a hero
I never wanted to be a man

I hurt you darlin'
I made you cry
I hurt you darlin'
Don't ask me why

Refrain:
Move move move away from me darlin'
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move move move away from me darlin'
I never said I'd understand
(But) If I could say this was judgement day
You know I'd be a millionaire

I'm prepared to wear my sorrow
Everywhere we go in town
Ain't no need to beg or borrow
While you're there to drag me down

I hurt you darlin'
I made you cry
I hurt you darlin'

Refrain: ...

Whispered justice right
Move away I need you so
I can't let go

I hurt you darlin'
I made you cry
I hurt you darlin'
Don't ask me why

Move move move away from me darlin'
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move move move away from me darlin'
I never said I'd understand

Move move move away from me darlin'
I never said I'd hold your hand
But if I could say this was judgement day
I'd be a millionaire, oh
