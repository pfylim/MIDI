Singer : CATS 
Title  : MARIBAJA

I remember still, how I heard you say
Well I'm off today
Isn't it a lovely day to take you for a ride
Show our countryside
Nothing on your mind just easy going
And though it wasn't meant at all to fall
in love at once
The beauty of the place just stole my heart
I had never seen a paradise before

Maribaja Maribaja like a little Himalaya
How I love you Maribaya
When I think of you I sigh out
Maribaja Maribaja made me feel a maharajah
How I miss you Maribaja I cry out

I remember still, how you said that name
Ev'ry time the same
When I asked you say it once again it
sounds so nice
A name for paradise
Then I realized, how you did look at me
And though it wasn't meant at all to fall
in love at once
The only persons there where were you and me
I was Adam and the other was Eve
