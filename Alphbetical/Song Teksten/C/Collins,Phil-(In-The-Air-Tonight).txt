Title  : IN THE AIR TONIGHT
Artist : PHIL COLLINS

(Words & music: Phil Collins)

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
And I been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord

Well, if youtold me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

Chorus:
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord

Well, I remember, I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget, it's the first time, the last time
We ever met
But I know the reason why you keep the silence up
No, you don't fool me, the hurt doesn't show
But pain still grows
It's no stranger to you and me
