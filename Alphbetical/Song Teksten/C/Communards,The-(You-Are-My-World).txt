There is nothing boy that can stop my course
I will hold you tight never let you go
tomorrow's party will never end
like a bud in spring our love will bloom and grow.

You eyes to me are precious stones
on a face that's made of solid gold
when I hold your hand I want to cry
and your loving arms to protect me
from the cold you are my world.

The soul inside now belongs to you
I'm drowning in a love so deep
we will overcome those ups and downs
so happiness is forever ours to keep.

I will follow you to the end of time
I will be the blood  flowing through your veins
I will ride with you till the end of the line.
You will be my everything; my world
you are, you are, you are, you are.
Oh boy; you are my world.
