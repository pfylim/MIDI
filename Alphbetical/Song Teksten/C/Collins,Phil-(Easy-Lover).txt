PHILIP BAILEY & PHIL COLLINS - EASY LOVER


Easy lover, she'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other, before you know it,
You'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover, she'll take your heart,
But you won't feel it
She's like no other, and I'm just trying to make you see

She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You better forget it, you'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it, ooh you'll regret it

No you'll never change her
So leave her, leave her
Get out quick, 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

Refrain:
She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
Like no other, before you know it
You'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart
But you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
Better forget it, you'll never get it
And she'll say that there's no other
'til she finds another
Better forget it, ooh you'll regret it

Now don't try to change her
Just leave her, leave her
You're the only one, seeing is believing
It's the only way, you'll ever know

Refrain: ...
