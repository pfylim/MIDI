Title  : SAME OLD STORY
Artist : RANDY CRAWFORD

(Words & music: W. Jennings/Joe Sample)

Chorus:
Same old story, same old song
Goes all right, 'til it goes all wrong
Now you're going, now you're gone
Same old story, same old song

One hand will take, one hand will give
That's all we know and that's how we live
One day hello, next day goodbye
And ev'ry just stays high

Chorus: ...

One builds you up, one tears you down
To some you're a saint, to others you're a clown
What can ya do, just see it through
And hold on to what is left of you
