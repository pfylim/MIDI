DO YOU REALLY WANT TO HURT ME - CULTURE CLUB


Give me time to realize my crime
let me love and steal
i have danced inside your eyes how can i be real

Refrain:
   Do you really want to hurt me
   do you really want to make me cry

Precios kisses words that burn me
lovers never ask you why in my heart
the fire's burning choose my colour find a star
precios people always tell me that's a step
a step too far

Refrain:
   
Words are few i have spoken
i could waste a thousand years wrapped in sorrow
words are token come inside and catch my tears
you've been talking but believe me
if it's true you do not know
this boy loves without a reason
i'm prepared to let you go

If it's love you want from me
then take it away
everything is not what you see
it's over today

It's a celebration.
Celebrate good times, come on,
let's celebrate.
come on and celebrate - tonight.
