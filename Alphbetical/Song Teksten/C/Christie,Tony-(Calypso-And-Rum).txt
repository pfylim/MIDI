
3. Calypso And Rum - Tony Christie

We gonna fly away to sunny weather
On the beach all day
The time has come for us to be together
Dance the night away
We will be making love under the moonlight
Shining on the sand
I will take you to wonderland.

CHORUS:
Calypso and rum into the night
Calypso and rum holding you tight
And everybody will say
Calypso and rum every day
Calypso and rum make you feel nice
Calypso and rum sugar and spice
And everybody will say
Calypso and rum everyday.

We're gonna leave our worries far behind us
Life has just begun
We're gonna go where nobody will find us
Following the sun
And when we reach our magic destination
We're without a care
Mix with music when we are there.

Calypso and rum into the night
Calypso and rum holding you tight
And everybody will say
Calypso and rum every day.
And when the sun goes down
We're gonna hit the town together
And we will never stop
Until we dance our cares away.

Rum rum hey hey hey
Everybody will say.

CHORUS
(REPEAT 3X
