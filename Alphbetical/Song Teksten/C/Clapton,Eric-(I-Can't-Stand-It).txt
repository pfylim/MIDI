You've been told, so maybe it's time that you learned.
You've been sold, maybe it's time that you earned.
I can't stand it. You're foolin' around.
I can't stand it. You're running around.
I won't stand it. Foolin' around with my heart.
I'll explain, I feel like I'm bein' used.
Make it plain, so you don't get confused.
I can't stand it. Foolin' around.
I won't stand it. You're  running around.
I can't stand it. 
I can't stand it. You're running around,
I can't stand it. You're foolin' around;
I can't stand it. You're playin' around with my heart.

It was time. Time for me to let you know.
Ain't no crime, no crime to let your feelings show.
I can't stand it. You're runnin' around,
I can't stand it. You're playin' around;
I can't stand it. You're foolin' around,
I can't stand it. Your running around,
I can't stand it. You're playin' around,
I can't stand it. Foolin' around, 
I can't stand it. Runnin' around,
I can't stand it. Runnin' around, I won't stand it.
You're runnin' around, I won't stand it.
You're foolin' around, I won't stand it.
You're playin' around, I won't stand it.
You're runnin' around with my heart.
You're foolin' around with my heart, my heart.
Runnin' around with, foolin' around with my heart.
Foolin' around, I can't stand it.
Running around, I won't stand it.
Foolin' around, I won't stand it.
Foolin' around, I won't stand it.
Foolin' around, I can't stand it.
Runnin' around, I can't stand it.
Foolin' around, I can't stand it.
Runnin' around it. Runnin' around it.
Runnin' around it. Runnin' around it.
Runnin' around it. Run, run, run, runnin' around it.
