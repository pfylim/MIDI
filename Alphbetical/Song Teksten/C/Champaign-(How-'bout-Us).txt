Title  : HOW 'BOUT US
Artist : CHAMPAIGN

(Words & music: Dana Walden)

Ooh short and sweet
No sense in draggin' on past our needs
Let's don't keep it hangin' on
If the fire's out, we should both be gone

Chorus:
Some people are made for each other
Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us?
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Tell me, can we?

Now, don't you get me wrong (What you're saying to me baby)
'Cause I'm trying now to end it all (Let's start something new)
It's just that I've seen (What have you seen)
Too many lovers hearts lose their dreams (We won't lose it)

Chorus: ...

How 'bout us, how 'bout us baby
How 'bout us, how 'bout us baby
