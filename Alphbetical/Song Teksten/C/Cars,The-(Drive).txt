           Drive ( The Cars )


Who's gonna tell you when it's too late ?
Who's gonna tell you things aren't so great ?

Refr. You can't go on thinking nothing's wrong .
      Who's gonna drive you home tonight ?

Who's gonna pick you up when you fall ?
Who's gonna hang it up when you call ?
Who's gonna pay attention to your dreams ?
And who's gonna plug their ears when you scream ?

Refr. You can't go on thinking ...

Who's gonna hold you down when you shake ?
Who's gonna come around when you break ?

Refr. You can't go on thinking ...

You know you can't go on thinking nothing's wrong ...
