  9. One Night In Bangkok - Chess
  
  Bangkok oriental setting
  And the city don't know what the city is kept
  The cr me de la cr me of the chess world
  And the show with everything but Yul Brunner
  Time flies doesn't seem a minute
  Since the Tyrolean bars had the chess bards in it
  All changed don't you know that when you planned this level
  There's no ordinary venue
  It's Iceland or the Philippine or Hastings
  Or this place.
  
  One night in Bangkok
  And the world's your oyster
  The bars and temples but the booze ain't free
  You finally got it every golden oyster
  And if your lucky then the god is a she
  I can feel an angel sliding up to me.
  
  One town's very like another
  When your head's down over your pieces brother
  It's a drag (it's a bore) it's really such a pity
  To be looking at the board not looking at the city
  What do you mean?
  You've seen one crowded polluted stinking town
  Deep down swollen, sleep
  Summer set up in the summer set mostly
  Get tired you're talking to a tourist
  Whose every moves among the purest
  I get my kicks above the waistline sunshine.
  
  One night in Bangkok makes a hard man bumble
  That must be between despair and ecstasy
  One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
  Can't be too careful with your company
  I can feel the devil walking next to me. 
  
  Siam's going to be the witness
  To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
  This grips me more than would a muddy old river
  Or a reclining Buddha
  Thank god I'm only watching the game
  Controlling it
  I don't see you guys rating
  The kind of mate I'm contemplating
  I'd let you watch I would invite you
  But the queens we use would not excite you
  So you'd better go back to your bars your temples
  Your massage parlours.
  
  One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
  The bars and temples but the booze ain't free
  You finally got it in every golden oyster
  A little flesh a little history
  I can feel an angel sliding up to me
  One night in Bangkok makes a hard man bumble
  Not much between despair and ecstasy
  One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
  Can't be too careful with your company
  I can feel the devil walking next to me.
