
11. THE SPIRIT - CENTORY & TURBO B.

I've been on this journey for years
But now I am stronger than ever
Because I have unlocked the secrets
Of the spirits.

Oona eya ah
Oona eya ah
Oona eya ah
Oona eya ah

Oona eya ah eya ah
Oona eya ah eya ah
Oona eya ah eya ah
Oona eya ah eya ah

Like the three in a row my haunt you
Mercy taught you
You know that I want you
No feel
The real feel holy feel check it
You know that I'll wreck it
I know you expect it

So want deliver
Make a body shiver
Pull up the rug
Like rabbits on a river
'Cause I'm a survivor
And if your smears broke back
The picture like my driver
And I softly
Looking like span in the back
Back up off me
'Cause I got the fury
Label the mad man
Woman was victory.

All I want to do
Is do what I like
Rock the mike
And make you dance all night
So don't be afraid
When you hear it
It breaks the spirit.

Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit.

Oona eya ah eya ah (aia eya)
Oona eya ah eya ah (aia eya)
Oona eya ah eya ah (aia eya)
Oona eya ah eya ah (aia eya)


Can I get on
Can I get on
I'm not that strong
I'm not taking that pawn
Like get the bomb
I bash and smash you
With a hit roller
Thick like two thin grits
Dig it.

Spirit of fire
Let me burn on
Spirit of earth
Keep me strong
Spirit of the wind
Give me swiftness
Fare enough
Want to let me float
Can I get a witness,

Two good source of my power
People I devour
Bring it up
Like a hot shower
I got to go on
Wicked like branding my ticket
Bring your money
Get with it
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you hear it?
Can you hear it?
Let the soul hold the spirit
Sing.

Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit.

Oonga eya ah eya ah...

Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit
Can you feel the spirit.

Oonga eya ah eya ah...
