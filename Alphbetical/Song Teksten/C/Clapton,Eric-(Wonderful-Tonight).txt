ERIC CLAPTON - WONDERFUL TONIGHT

(Words & music: Eric Clapton)

It's late in the evening
She's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
And brushes her long blonde hair

And then she asks me
Do I look all right?
And I say yes
You look wonderful tonight

Refrain:
Wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
Then the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't
Realize how much I love you

We go to a party
And ev'ry one turns to see
This beautiful lady
Is walking around with me
And then she asks me
Do you feel all right
And I say yes
I feel wonderful tonight

Refrain: ...

It's time to go home now
And I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her
As I turn out the light
I say my darling
You are wonderful tonight

Refrain: ...
