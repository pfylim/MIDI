well, the Southside of Chicago
is the badest part in town
and if you go down there you better
just beware of a man name of Leroy Brown.
Now Leroy more than trouble, 
you see he stand 'bout sixfoot four.
All the downtown ladies call him "tree-top lover",
all the man just call him "Sir".

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, 
the baddest man in the whole damned town;
badder than old King Kong
and meaner than a junkyard dog.

Now Leroy he a gambler
and he like hi fancy clothes.
And he like to wave his diamond rings
in front of ev'rybody's nose.
He got a custom Continental,
he got a Eldorado, too.
He got a thirty two gun in his pocket for fun,
he got a razor in his shoe.

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, 
the baddest man in the whole damned town;
badder than old King Kong
and meaner than a junkyard dog.

Well friday 'bout a week ago,
Leroy shoot in'dice
and at the edge of the bar sat a girl 
name of Doris and oh, that girl looked nice.
Well, he cast his eyes upon her,
and the trouble soon began,
and Leroy Brown, he learned
a lesson 'bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man.

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, 
the baddest man in the whole damned town;
badder than old King Kong
and meaner than a junkyard dog.

Well, the two men took the fightin', 
and when they pulled them from the floor
Leroy looked like a jigsaw puzzle 
with a couple of pieces gone.

And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, 
the baddest man in the whole damned town;
badder than old King Kong
and meaner than a junkyard dog.

yes, you were badder than old King Kong,
and meaner than a junkyard dog.
