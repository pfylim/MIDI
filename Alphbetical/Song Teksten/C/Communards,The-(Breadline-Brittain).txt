This Breadline Britain
this free and promised land
where the rich don't give a damn
people getting hungry 
and people getting poor.
People getting destitute and more.
This is Breadline Britain.

Oh, you've got to understand
where evil's in command
where money buys only pipedreams
and a workers life is damned.
Democracy and freedom 
are a far off foreign land.

Where the sick don't stand a chance
where fascism leads a new dance
where they'd privatise your mother
if given half a chance.
This is Breadline Britain
you've got to make a stand

Breadline, breadline, breadline Britain.
Breadline, breadline, breadline Britain.
This free and promised land.
