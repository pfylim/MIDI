SAM COOKE - WONDERFUL WORLD

Don't know much about history
Don't know much biology
Don't know much about a science book
Don't know much about the French I took
But I do know that I love you
And I know that if you loved me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Don't know much about geography
Don't know much trigonometry
Don't know much about algebra
Don't know what a slide rule is for
But I do know one and one is two
And I know that if you loved me too
What a wonderful world this would be

Now I don't claim to be an 'A' student
But I'm trying to be
For maybe by being an 'A' student baby
I can win your love for me
