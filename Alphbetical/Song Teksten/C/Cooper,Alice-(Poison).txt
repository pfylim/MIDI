ALICE COOPER - POISON

(Words & music: Desmond Child/Alice Cooper/John McCurry)

Your cruel device
Your blood like ice
One look could kill
My pain your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I wanted too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are better than poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains

Your love so hot
Your web I'm caught
Your skin so wet
Black lace I'm sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins
I wanna hurt you but your lips are better than poison
I wanna touch you but you're under my skin
I wanna kiss you but your lips are better than poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison

One look could kill
My pain your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch (don't touch)
I wanna hold you but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I wanted too much (too much)
I wanna taste you but your lips are better than poison
You're poison running through my veins
You're poison
I don't wanna break these chains
Poison
