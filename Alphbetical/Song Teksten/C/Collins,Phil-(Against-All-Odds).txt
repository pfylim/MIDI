PHIL COLLINS - AGAINST ALL ODDS

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just like the memory of your face
Now take a look at me now
'Cos there's just an empty space
But to wait for you
Is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a look at me now
Yes I'll be standing there
And you coming back to me
Is against all odds
It's the choice I've got to take

Take a look at me now
