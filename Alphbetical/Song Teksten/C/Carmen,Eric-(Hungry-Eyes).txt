Title  : Hungry Eyes
Singer : Eric Carmen


I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
Darlin' tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

CHORUS:
With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I want to hold you so hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about
Darlin' tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

CHORUS

Now I've got you im my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be
