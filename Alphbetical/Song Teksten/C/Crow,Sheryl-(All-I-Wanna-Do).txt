1. All I Wanna Do - Sheryl Crow

Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.
All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die
Says the man next to me I don't know where
Just … propos of nothing he says his name's William
But I'm sure he's Bill, Billy or Mack or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
And we are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
At the bar that faces the giant car-wash
The good people in the world are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts and suits
They drive their shining Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company and the record store too
But they're nothing like Billy and me
'Cause all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do
Is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match in an oversize pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before he's blowing and cursing them out
He's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his one end
But all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do
Is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
A day and a night and the car-wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
all I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do
Is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do
Is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard.
