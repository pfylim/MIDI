Title  : I WANT YOUR LOVE

(Words & music: Bernard Edwards/Nile Rodgers)

Chorus:
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

Do you feel like you ever want
To try my love and see how well it fits?
Baby, can't you see when you look at me
I can't kick this feelin' when it hits
All alone in my bed at night
I grab my pillow and squeeze it tight
I think of you and I dream of you
All the time, what am I gonna do?

Chorus: ...

Some time don't you feel like you 
Never really had a love that's real?
Well, here I am and who's to say
A better love you won't find today?
Just one chance and I will show you love
Like no other two steps above
On your ladder I'll be a peg
I want your lovin', please don't make me beg

Chorus: ...

I'll share my dreams and make you see 
How really bad your love I need
I want your love, I need your love
Just like the birds need the sky above
I'll share my dreams and make you see 
How really bad your love I need
