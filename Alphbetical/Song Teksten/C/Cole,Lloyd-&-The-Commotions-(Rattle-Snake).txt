LLOYD COLE & THE COMMOTIONS - RATTLESNAKES

Jodi wears a hat, although it hasn't rained for six days
She says a girl needs a gun these days, hey
On account of all the rattlesnakes

REFRAIN 1:
She looks like Eva Marie Saint in 'On The Waterfont'
She reads Simone de Beauvoir in her American circumstance

She is less sure if her heart has come to stay in San Jose
And her never borne child still haunts her as
she speeds down the freeway
As she tries her luck with the traffic police
Out of boredom more than spite
She never finds no trouble because she tries too hard
She's obvious despite herself

REFRAIN 2:
She looks like Eva Marie Saint in 'On The Waterfont'
She says all she needs is therapy - yeah!
All you need is love is all you need

Jodi never sleeps because there are always
needles in the hay
She says, a girl needs a gun these days, hey on
account of all  the rattlesnakes

REFRAIN 1: ...

Her heart, her heart's like crazy paving upside
down and back-to-front
She says, ooooh, it's hard to love when love was
your great disappointment
La la lal la la la la la ...
