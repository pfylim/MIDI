First , when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream ,
That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind.
All alone I have cried silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel , made of stone.

Well, I hear the music ,close my eyes,
Feel the rhythm , wrap around,take a hold of my heart.
What a feeling, bein's believin' ,
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life.
Take your passion and make it happen.
Pictures come alive , you can dance right through your life.

Now , I hear the music , close my eyes,
I am rhythm - in a flash it takes hold of my heart.
What a feeling , bein's believin'.
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life.
Take your passion and make it happen.
Pictures come alive , now I'm dancing through my life.

What a feeling. - What a feeling.I am music now.
Bein's believin',I am rhythm now.
Pictures come alive , you can dance right through your life,
What a feeling.I can really have it all.
What a feeling.I can really have it all...
