Ev'rybody dance now
Ev'rybody dance now
Give me the music

Ev'rybody dance now
Ev'rybody dance now
Do da da do da da
--------------------------------------------------------
Back with the parce
My jam is live and I'm best
And I don't waste time
Off the mic with a dope
Rhyme jump tothe rhythm jump
Jump to the rhythm jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make
You shake your pants
Take a chance
Come on and dance
--------------------------------------------------------
Move next in line
Groove want me all right
Come on let's sweat baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you sweat
Sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
--------------------------------------------------------
Pause take a breath
And go for yours
On my command
Now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat
'Til you bleed
Is that dope enough indeed
I paid the price to control the dice
I`m more precise to the points
I'm free
Let the music take control
Of your heart ans soul
Unfold your body is free
And behold
Dance 'til ya can't dance
'til
you can't dance no more
Get off the floor and get above
Then come back and upside down
Easy now let me see
You move ...
Groove ...

Ev'rybody dance now
Ev'rybody dance now
Give me the music
Give me the music
Ev'rybody dance now
Ev'rybody dance now
