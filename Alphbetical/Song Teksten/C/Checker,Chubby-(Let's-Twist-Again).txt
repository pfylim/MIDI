Title  : LET'S TWIST AGAIN

Let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah let's twist again
Like we did last year
Don't cha remember when
Things were really hummin'
Yeah let's twist again
Twistin' time is here

A-roun'n'a-roun'n up 'n down
We go again
Oh baby make me know you love me so
And then, let's twist again
Like we did last summer
Yeah let's twist again
Like we did last year
