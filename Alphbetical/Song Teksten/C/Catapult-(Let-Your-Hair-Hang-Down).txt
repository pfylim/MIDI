Title  : LET YOUR HAIR HANG DOWN

Spend my time in a rock and roll spot
Dirty mean thoughts are mine
Second hand are all I have
I am working on a dead line

My buddy told me not to do like this
Boozing and hanging around
He said to me don't be loose
Get your feet back on the ground

Refrain:
Hey! get around
Let your hair hang down
If you don't know how
I'll show you now
Swing out of bounds
Be the talk of the town
That's the way to let
Your hair hang down

Refrain: ...

Please don't tell me how to live
I'll do it in my way
Life's so short enjoy it now
Live from day to day
