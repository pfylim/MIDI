1. A GIRL LIKE YOU - EDWYN COLLINS

I've never known a girl like you before
Now, just like in a song from days of yore
Here you come knocking, knocking on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before
Give me just a taste so I want more
And my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you caught me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before
Make me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to can, I'm talking metaphorically
Hope that I'm talking allegorically
Know that I'm talking about the way I feel
And I've never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before
Has the old times changed so much
Don't seal that I belong
Too many poorest singers
Not enough poorest songs
And now you've come along
Yes, you've come along
And I've never met a girl like you before
It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah
It's all right, yeah (to fade)
