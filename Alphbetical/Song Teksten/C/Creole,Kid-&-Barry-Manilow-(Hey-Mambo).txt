B: 
Nobody knew who he really was
But they called him Mambo when he played

K:
He became the King
King of Latin swing

together:
And oh, the music that he made

Hey Mambo, did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo, did she know what she beget?

K:
They used to come in their fancy threads
And he always turned them inside out

B:
They would jam the floor

Together:
They would beg for more

B:
And when they got it they would shout

Together:
Hey Mambo, did your mama teach you that
Hey Mambo, did she know what she beget?
Take it away
