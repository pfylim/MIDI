Title  : Hey Baby
Singer : Bruce Channel


CHORUS:
Hey, hey baby
I wanna know
If you'll be my girl

When I say you walking
Down the street
I said  that's the kind of
Gal I'd like to meet
She's so pretty
Lord, she's fine
I'm gonna make her mine all mine

CHORUS

When you turned and
Walked away
That's when I want to say
Come on baby give me a whirl
I wanna know if you'll be my girl

CHORUS
