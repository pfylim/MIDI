Title  : SAVE THE LAST DANCE FOR ME

(Words & music: Doc Pomus/Mort Shuman)

You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

Refrain:
But don't forget
Who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darling save the last dance for me

Oh I know
That the music is fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
While we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

Refrain: ...

Baby don't you know I love you so
Can't you feel it when we touch
I will never ever let you go
I love you oh so much

You can dance
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone
Can he take you home
Please you must tell him no

Refrain: ...
