                      TEARS IN HEAVEN
   
  Would you know my name, if i saw you in heaven
  Would it be the same, if I saw you in heaven
  I must be strong, and carry on
  Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven

  Would you hold my hand, if I saw you in heaven
  Would you help me stand, if i saw you in heaven
  I'll find my way tghrough night and day
  Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven

  TIME CAN BRING ME DOWN, TIME CAN BEND YOUR KNEES
  TIME CAN BREAK YOUR HEART, HAVING BEGGING PLEASE,BEGGING PLEASE

  Would you hold my hand, if i saw you in heaven
  Would you help me stand, if I saw you in heaven
  Beyond the door, there's peace I'm sure
  And I'll know there'll be no more tears in heaven

  Would you know my name, if i saw you in heaven
  Would it be the same, if I saw you in heaven
  I must be strong, and carry on
  Cause I know I don't belong, here in heaven

  Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven...........
