                 Rhythm of the falling rain


Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
tellin'me just what a fool I've been
I wish that I could hold it let me cry and then
dont't let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
looking for a brandnew start
but little does she know that when she left that day
along with her she took my haert

Rain won't you tell her that her love ain't fair
for her to steel my heart away when she don't care
I can't stick another 'cause my heart's somewhere far away

Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain.....
