I watch your window
I shake so scared.
Spying from my room
with nervous unrest
Night after night your fingers caressing
the skin that is so fair you slowly undress.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
I know that you know that I'm here each night
watching and praying the time is now right.
for me to undress and caress you
until then I'll just sit here and dream.

Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
cold the night, cold the night.

Soon my love.
Soon my secret lover.
Soon my love.
Soon my secret lover.
Soon my love.
Soon my secret lover.
Soon my lover.

I watch your window
I shake so scared.
Spying from my room
with nervous unrest.
Night after night your fingers caressing
the skin that is so fair you slowly undress.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Soon we will be together
until then so cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Ooh it's so cold without you
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
Cold the night.
forever ours to keep.
