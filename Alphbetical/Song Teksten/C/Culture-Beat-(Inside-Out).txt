6. INSIDE OUT - CULTURE BEAT

You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
No doubt that I am open in total disarray
Scary that I have found for what I have been hoping
Yet I choose to play
The pull of the fantasy of bliss pulls me to your presence
Silly to fear what I've missed
Thoughts into my essence
I'm inside out
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out
And I don't have the slightest doubt
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
Love shall not evade me
Pursue it I shall
Hearts entwine my mission
The tolling of the bells
Lonely when you found me
Depressed I am no more
The games of daze have ceased
Love you to the core
I'm inside out
You turn me inside out
Turn me inside out
You tell me what it's all about 
(Inside out)
To make the tears run dry
You turn me inside out (inside)
And I don't have the slightest doubt
'Cause I can see
'Cause I can see
You can see
You can see
What's really inside of me
What's really inside of me
Inside out
I can see 
You can see
What's really inside of me.
