Title  : SEVEN ELEVEN

Seven eleven

Double your money in a little time
Don't be shaky it's not a crime

Seven eleven

Come on try it, don't be shy
Put in your money and roll the dice

The looser cries he crept out
There's the winner hear him shout

Refrain:
Tonight surprise surprise
Lady Luck is on your side
The more you stake, the more you make
You just gonna get it tonight

Refrain: ...

Seven eleven

And in the end you hit the jack
Hear them whisper behind your back

Seven eleven

You stake again, there's no return
You loose it all, will you ever learn

The looser cries he crept out
There's the winner hear him shout

Refrain: ...

(solo)

Refrain: ...(2x)...
