Something inside of me's out of control
I can't contain it so just let it go
baby I'm so sold on you can't you see
what you're doing to me.

Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.

Baby I waited here counting the days
hoping and praying and blueing away.

Now that you're here with me all of
my dreams have come true.

Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
(I got you, I got you)
Yeah, yeah.

Could it be magic this feeling inside
Baby you move me in every way.
All of these things that you do
feel so good. Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, ooh.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.

Something inside of me's out of control.
Baby can't stop it so just let it go.
Baby for you I'd go down on my knees and I'd pray.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
Now that I've got you in my hands
won't let you slip away.
