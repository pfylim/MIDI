Title  : MY FORBIDDEN LOVER

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

Chorus:
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other
My forbidden lover
I don't want no other

I fell in love
And I didn't want to do it 'cause I knew
That your love wasn't true
You try to hide
That sinister appearance and the lies
When those alibis
You give your love
To anyone who asks, yes you do
And I knkow that it's true, ooh
But still I care
And I want to see you there when I need
Yes indeed
You are

Chorus: ...

I can't resist
That very string urge to have you, dear
Oh please come here
Just let me love you
Anytime and anyplace we dare
We'll just let them stare
You want to love
Everybody and everything you can
You're the typical man
Yet still and all
I'm at your back and call when you need
Yes indeed
You are

Chorus: ...
