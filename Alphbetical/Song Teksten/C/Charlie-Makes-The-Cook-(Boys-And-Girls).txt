BOYS AND GIRLS - CHARLIE MAKES THE COOK



I like to watch the sun go down
At the end of a beautiful day
Neon lights of the city glow
And I'm dressed up 
   ready to play

In the street 
There's a rhythm
   that's moving round me
And the night is young
And the party's only just begun

All you beautiful people
All you beautiful boys and girls
We're having a party tonight
All over the world
All you boys and girls

Call your friends to let them know
Where everybody's going to be
It's at a nightclub in Soho
And we're all in ecstasy

Take control of your body
   your mind and soul
It's a holiday
Let the music play the night away

All you beatiful peoople...

Boys and girls
All you boys and girls

Take control of your body ...

All you beautiful people ...
