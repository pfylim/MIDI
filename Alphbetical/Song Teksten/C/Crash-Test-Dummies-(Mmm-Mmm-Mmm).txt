  ONCE THERE WAS THIS KID WHO
  GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT
  AND COULDN'T COME TO SCHOOL
  BUT WHEN HE FINALLY CAME BACK
  HIS HAIR
  HAD TURNED FROM BLACK
  INTO BRIGHT WHITE
  HE SAID THAT IT WAS FROM WHEN
  THE CARS HAD SMASHED SO HARD

  ONCE THERE WAS THIS GIRL WHO
  WOULDN'T GO AND CHANGE
  WITH THE GIRLS IN THE CHANGE ROOM
  AND WHEN THEY FINALLY MADE HER
  THEY SAW BIRTHMARKS ALL OVER HER BODY
  SHE COULDN'T QUITE EXPLAIN IT
  THEY'D ALWAYS JUST BEEN THERE
  
  MMM MMM MMM MMM

  BUT BOTH GIRL AND BOY WERE GLAD
  THAT ONE KID HAD IT WORSE THAN THAT
  
  'CAUSE THEN THERE WAS THIS BOY WHOSE
  PARENTS MADE HIM COME DIRECTLY HOME
  RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL
  AND WHEN
  THEY WENT TO THEIR CHURCH
  THEIR JOCK HAD LURCHED ALL OVER THE CHURCH FLOOR
  HE COULDN'T QUITE EXPLAIN IT
  THEY'D ALWAYS JUST GONE THERE
