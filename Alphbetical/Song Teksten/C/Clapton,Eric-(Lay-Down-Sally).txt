There is nothing that is wrong in wanting you to stay with me.
I know you've got somewhere to go, but won't you make yourself at home, 
and stay with me ?
And don't you ever leave.

Lay down Sally and rest here in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to ?
Lay down Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long 
just to talk to you.

The sun ain't nearly on the rise, and we still got the moon and stars above.
Underneath the velvet skies, love is all that matters; 
won't you stay with me ?
And don't you ever leave.

Refrain

I long to see the morning light colouring your face so dreamily.
So don't you go and good-bye; you can lay your worries down and
stay with me.
And don't you ever leave.

Refrain
