CUTTING CREW - (I JUST) DIED IN YOUR ARMS

Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can't find
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed the cats in her cradle
Who would have thought that a boy like
Me could come to this

Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, should've walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this
Oh the surface I'm a name on the list
I try to be discreet, then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many tomes

Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, should've walked away

It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over, the moment has gone
I followed my heart not my head
I know I was wrong

Oh I just died in your arms
