STYLE COUNCIL - SHOUT TO THE TOP

I was half in mind, I was half in need
And as the rain came down I dropped to my
knees and prayed
I said, Oh, heavenly thing, please clean my soul
I've seen all on offer and I'm not impressed at all

I was half way home I was half insane
And ev'ry shop window I looked in
Just looked the same
I said, Now send me a sign to save my life
'Cause on this moment in time
There's nothing certain in this life of mine

You see, it's a frightening thing
When it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked
I might as well stay and promise myself each
and every day

That when you're knocked on your back
And your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom
There's nothing else but to shout to the top
Oh, we're gonna shout to the top
Oh, we're gonna shout to the top
Hey we're gonna shout to the top

You see it's a frightening thing
When it dawns upon you
That I know as much as the day I was born
And though I wasn't asked
I might as well stay and promise myself each
and every day

We're gonna shout to the top, shout (5x)
Shout to the top, shout

So when you're knocked on your back
And your life's a flop
And when you're down on the bottom
There's nothing else but to shout to the top
Shout
Oh, we're gonna shout to the top
We're gonna shout to the top, shout
And when you're knocked on your back
and your life's a flop
