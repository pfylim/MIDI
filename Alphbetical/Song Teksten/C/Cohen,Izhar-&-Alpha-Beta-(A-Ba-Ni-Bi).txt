Title  : A-BA-NI-BI

(Words & music: Zach/Izhar Cohen)

Chorus:
Aba ni bo no bo ne be
Aba ni bi no bo ne be na bo na ba (2x)

Oh when I was a little child
My days were happy free and wild
But when I loved I couldn't say
The words I wanna say today

The words were always spinnin' in my head
I used to whisper them at night in bed
And when I loved I didn't try to hide
Those magic words I heard inside

Chorus: ...

Love is kind
Love is all around
It's a lovely sound
Lost and found

Love is free
Love's been good to me
I'm in love, I'm so bright because the language
Of love is inside

Chorus: ...

I want to say the words of yesterday
I wanna love you in the same old way
The words of love are coming close to shore
So let me say them more and more

Aba ni bi no bo ne be
Aba ni bi no bo ne be na bo na ba (5x)
