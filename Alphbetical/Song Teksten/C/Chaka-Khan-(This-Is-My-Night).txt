CHAKA KHAN - THIS IS MY NIGHT

Ah ah tonight
I'm putting on my make-up it's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me
I'm ready and I'm willing to pull out happy feelings
Something special's in the air for me
The night is mine (is mine) I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel is my pocket ride
It feels so right this mirror's telling no lies
Gonna let this magic shine

Refrain:
This is my night (tonight) I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

Refrain: ...

I feel like winning I don't know the reason
Something's telling me let it ride
Got me rocking and reeling I don't know what the deal is
Something special I just can't describe
The night is mine (mine) I'm gonna keep it just right
On the way to paradise
It feels so fine (fine) feels just like the first time
Going all the way this night

Refrain: ...(2x)...

This is my night (come out) this is this is my night
This is my night
This is my my my my my my my my night
This feels so right the nearest step in your life
I'm gonna let this magic shine let it shine let it shine

Refrain: ...

Let it shine
This is my night my night (tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)

Refrain: ...
