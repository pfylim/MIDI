12. YESTERDAY ONCE MORE - CARPENTERS

Intro (3/4 Takt Piano): 

Vers 1:
When I was young  I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs.
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile
Those were such happy times  and not so long ago,
How I wondered where they'd gone.
But they're back again  just like a long lost friend,
All the songs I love so well:

1.Refrain:
Every "Sha-la-la-la", every "Wou-ou-ou-ou" still shines
Every "Shing-a-ling-a-ling" that they're startin' to sing 
-so fine
When they get to the part  where he's breakin' her heart
It can really make me cry!
Just like before - it's yesterday once more
(Chor: Shoo-bi-doo vang-vang, shoo-bi-doo vang-vang)

Vers 2:
Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had makes today seem rather sad 
- so much has changed..
It was songs of love that I would sing to then
And I'd memorized each word.
Those old melodies  still sound so good to me
As they melt the years away:

2.Refrain:
Every "Sha-la-la-la", every "Wou-ou-ou-ou" still shines
(Chor: Movies, oldies but goodies)
Every "Shing-a-ling-a-ling" that they're startin' to sing 
- so fine! 
All my best memories  come back clearly to me
Some can even make me cry!
Just like before - it's yesterday once more
(Chor: Shoo-bi-doo vang-vang)

3.Refrain:
Every "Sha-la-la-la", every "Wou-ou-ou-ou" still shines.
Every "Shing-a-ling-a-ling" that they're startin' to sing
- so fine ! 
Every "Sha-la-la-la", every "Wou-ou-ou-ou" still shines.
Every "Shing-a-ling-a-ling" that they're. (Fade out).
