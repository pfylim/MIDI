3. ONE SWEET DAY - MARIAH CAREY

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say.
Now it`s too late to hold you
`Cause you`ve flown away.
So far away.

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile.
Feeling and knowing you hear me.
It keeps me alive, alive.

Chorus
And I know you`re shining down on me
From heaven.
Like so many friends we`ve lost
Along the way.
And I know eventually we`ll be together
One sweet day.

Darling I never showed you.
Assumed you`d always be there.
I, I took you presence for granted
But I always cared.
And I miss the love we shared.

Chorus

Although the sun will shine the same
I`ll always look to a brighter day.
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray.

Chorus 2x

Sorry I never told you 
All I wanted to say.
