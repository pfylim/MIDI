Title  : BABY, WHAT A BIG SURPRISE

(Words & music: Peter Cetera)

Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only fakin' it
And like before
My heart was takin' it

Chorus:
Baby, what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes, oh-woh

Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today
You softly changed my mind

Chorus: ...

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
And you came to stay, ooh
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way, hey yeah

Now and then, just like before
I think about the love
I've thrown away
But now it doesn't matter anyway

Chorus: ...5x...
