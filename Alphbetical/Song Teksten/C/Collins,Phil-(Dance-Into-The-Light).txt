Strophe
C                 F           G
It`s there in the eyes of the children
F         C                      F      G F
And their face is smiling in the windows.
C               F           G
You can come on out from a long time ago
F      C                F      G F
Brush away the tears of freedom
Am                     F       C
Now we hear there`s no turning back.
   F         C
We have each other.
   F        C     G
We have one voice.
Dm              G       C
Hand in hand we lay the track.
            F
Because the train is coming
             C
To carry you home

Refrain
         G          C  F G
Come and dance with me.
            F       C            F G
Come on and dance into the light.
F C F G           F       C           F G F
Ooh     everybody dance into the light.

C                   F
There`ll be no more hiding

In the shadows of fear.

There`ll be no more change to hold you.
                    F      G           F
The future is yours - you hold the key.
            C                  F      G F
There`ll be no more walls with freedom.
Am             G        C
Now we hear we won`t go back.
   F        C
We have one word.
   F        C
We have one voice.
Dm                 G    C
Side by side we`re not afraid
            F
Because the train is coming
             C
To carry you home
