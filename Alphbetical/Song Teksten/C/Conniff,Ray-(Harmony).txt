Singer : RAY CONNIFF 
Title  : HARMONY

The time has come, let us begin
With all our voices joining in
To sing of love and brotherhood
People doing what they should do

Help their fellow men be free
And fill this land with harmony
The young and old, the rich the poor
Making sounds never heard before

Refrain:
Harmony, harmony, let's all join in
Harmony, sing away the hurt and fear
A brand new day will soon be here

Like a shepherd guards his sheep
Watch you children as they sleep
Like a potter turns his clay
Help us shape a better day and

Let us sing a song of love
There's one thing I'm certain of
Love will fill the hearts of men
Peace will come on earth once again

Refrain: ...
