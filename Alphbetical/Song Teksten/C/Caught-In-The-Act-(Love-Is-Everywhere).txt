5. Love Is Everywhere - Caught In The Act

Love is everywhere
To you I swear
Can't you feel 
You don't have to be alone
Love is everywhere
And I'll be there
Turn around 
Whenever you need someone.

I used to be lonely
Never played the game of love
Since I looked into your eyes
You are all I am thinking of
Now I can't believe it
But this miracle is true
Everywhere I turn my head 
I can't see no one but you
Smiling faces all around me
Come on and join the ride
Come on come on.

Love is everywhere
To you I swear
Can't you feel 
You don't have to be alone
Love is everywhere
And I'll be there
Turn around 
Whenever you need someone.

Tonight 
Baby can you feel my love 
Tonight
Baby can you feel my love
Tonight.

Love is a fire
Burning deep inside your soul
Your emotions are running wild
Better let it take control
We got the power
We're the people of today
If we give a little more 
We can find a better way
I can't forget the way you kissed me
I want you here tonight
Come on come on come on come on now

Love is everywhere
To you I swear
Can't you feel 
You don't have to be alone
Love is everywhere
And I'll be there
Turn around 
Whenever you need someone.

Tonight
Baby can you feel my love
Tonight (Love is everywhere)
Baby can you feel my love
Tonight (Can you feel my love around you?)

Baby can you feel, can you feel my love?

Love is everywhere
And I'll be there
Turn around
Whenever you need someone
Tonight
Baby can you feel my love?
Tonight (Love is everywhere)
Baby can you feel my love?
Tonight (Can you feel my love is all around?)
Baby can you feel my love? (It's all around it's all around).
