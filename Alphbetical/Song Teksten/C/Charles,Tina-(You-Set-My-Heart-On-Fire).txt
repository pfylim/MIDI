Title  : YOU SET MY HEART ON FIRE

Once my life was just a lonely room
With no one to take away my gloom
Waiting for someone to come
And fill my life with love oh sweet love
And set my heart on fire
Burning up the flame of love
Higher higher than the stars above
I need someone to turn me wilder wilder
Than the raging storm
Ooh I need somebody to turn me on the flame of love

Every cloud must have a silver lining
You came along my knight in armor shining
All my life I've been knockin' on doors
Now I'm so glad the door that opened was yours
Ooh pretty baby
I'm turning out your flame of love

And set my heart on fire
Burning up the flame of love
Higher higher than the stars above
I need someone to turn me wilder wilder
Than the raging storm
Ooh I need somebody to turn me on the flame of love
