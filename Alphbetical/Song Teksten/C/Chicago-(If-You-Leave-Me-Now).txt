Title  : IF YOU LEAVE ME NOW

(Words & music: Peter Cetera)

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh, no baby, please don't go
And if you leave me now
You'll take away the very heart of me
Ooh, no baby, please don't go
Oh, girl, I just want you to stay

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away
We've come too far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way
When tomorrow comes then we'll both regret 
The things we said today

If you leave me now
You'll take away the biggest part of me
Ooh, no baby, please don't go
Ooh, girl, I've got to have you by my side
Sweet mama, I just got to have your love inside me
