I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad
I long to try something I've never had
never had no kissing
ooh what have I been missing ?
Lover man oh where can you be ?
The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own.
Got the moon above me
got no-one to love me

I've heard it said that the thrill
of romance can be like a heavenly dream.
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll
soon make love to me, strange as it seems.

Somedays we meet and you'll try all my tears.
Then whisper sweet little things in my ears.
Hugging and a-kissing
ooh what have I been missing ?
Lover man oh where can you be ?
