Titel:             MANY RIVERS TO CROSS

Interpret/Text:    JIMMY CLIFF

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Many rivers to cross
but I just can't seem to find
my way over
wandering I am lost
as I travel along
the white cliffs of dover.

Many rivers to cross
and it's only my mind
that keeps me alive
well I've been licked and washed up for years.

And I merely survived
because of my pride.

And this loneliness won't leave me 'lone
it's such a drag to be on your own
my woman left me
and she didn't say why
well I guess I have to try.

So I guess I have to try, try
many, many, many, many rivers to cross
but just where to begin
I'm playing for time.

There have been times
I found myself
sitting in Limbo
oh no, oh no
for a lifetime.

Many rivers to cross
but I just can't seem to find
my way over.

Wandering I am lost
as I travel along
the white cliffs of dover.
