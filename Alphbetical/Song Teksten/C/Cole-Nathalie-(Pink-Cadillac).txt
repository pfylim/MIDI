NATALIE COLE - PINK CADILLAC

(Words & music : Bruce Springsteen)

You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do
Well baby, you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well come on over here and hug me
And baby I'll spill the facts
Well honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that, 
I love you for your

Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of
Your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac

Well now way back in the bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Into doing something they know is wrong
Well they tempt you man with silver and
They tempt you sir with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man I ain't going for that, I know it was her

Now some folks say it's too big and uses
Too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old and that it
Goes too fast
But love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger
Than a Subaru
Hey man there's only one thing and one
Car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it honey
We can park it out back and have a party
In your

Pink Cadillac, crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a saturday night
Honey I just wonder what you do there in back of
Your pink Cadillac, pink Cadillac
