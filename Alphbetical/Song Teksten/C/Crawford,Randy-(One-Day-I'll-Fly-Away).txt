Title  : ONE DAY I'LL FLY AWAY
Artist : RANDY CRAWFORD

(Words & music: W. Jennings/Joe Sample)

I make it alone, when love is gone
Still you made your mark, here in my heart

Chorus:
One day I'll fly away
Leave you love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When will love be through with me

I follow the night, can't stand the light
When will I begin, my life again

Chorus: ...

Why live life from dream to dream
Dread the day that dreaming ends
