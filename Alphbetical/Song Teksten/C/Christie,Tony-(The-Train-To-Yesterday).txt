You said it must end and now you've gone
But I still pretend our loves go on.
So guess where I went by train last night
I went to meet you and I held you tight.

Last night I took the train to yesterday
And soon again my arms were holding you.
Though life has lost it's meaning,
You can't stop me from dreaming,
So,I spend all my nights with you.

I went to paris where I met you
Excited to see the things we knew.
The lights by the Seine were still so bright
We sat there again and we kissed all night.

Last night I took the train to yesterday,...
