  12. WORLD IN YOUR HANDS (CULTURE BEAT)
  
  CHORUS:
  
  YOU CAN WALK LIKE WATER
  SHINE LIKE A DIAMOND
  RING THE BELLS OF FORTUNE
  IF YOU DARE
  YOU CAN MAKE ANY MOVE YOU
  WANNA MAKE
  TAKE EVERYTHING THAT YOU CAN
  IF YOU DARE
  JUST THINK THE WORLD IS IN YOUR
  HANDS (4-mal)
  
  STRESS ON MY MIND THINK I'LL END IT
  ALL
  PEOPLE TELL ME TO STAND TALL
  BUT I DON'T WANNA LIVE GOT NOTHING
  TO GIVE
  THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND FROM WHERE
  I COME
  MY PAST NOT A PRETTY ONE
  SCARS NEVER STARS NOW I'M READY TO
  QUIT
  AND LET THIS LIFE BE DONE
  SOME TELL ME TO HOLD ON TELL ME TO
  BE STRONG
  BUT THE BATTLE'S TOO LONG
  NO FIGHT LEFT IN ME BUT THEY DON'T
  COMPREHEND IT
  THAT MY WILL IS ALL GONE
  NOTHING TO GRASP
  HOPE IS A PAST AND MY FAITH IS IN THE
  TRASH
  SO SAVE THE LOVE THAT YOU THINK I
  NEED
  I' GOING OUT WITH A BLAST
  
  REPEAT CHORUS
  
  TROUBLES GOT ME DOWN NEVER GOT A
  BREAK
  JUST PAIN AND HEARTACHE
  NOT LOOKING FOR A REASON TO GO ON
  NO MORE
  I'VE HAD ALL I CAN TAKE
  TIRED OF THE SAME OLD THING SAME
  OLD SCENE
  DEATH MUST NOW BE KING
  I GIVE UP I DON'T WANT TO LIVE UP TO
  THE WICKED HOPES OF SOCIETY
  SOME SAY EXCEL BUT I STILL
  FAIL SO WELL
  JUST CALL ME A PRO
  REASONS FOR FAILING TRUTH
  BE KNOWN
  I REALLY DON'T CARE TO KNOW
  IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON TIME TO BE
  GONE FAREWELL TO MY KING
  JUST WANT TO END THIS LOSING TREND
  WITH A BULLET AND A SHOT OF GIN
  
  REPEAT CHORUS
  
  JUST THINK THE WORLD IS IN YOUR
  HANDS (FOUR TIMES)
