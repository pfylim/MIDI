THE COMMODORES - GOING TO THE BANK

She knows I want her
She knows I need her
She knows she got my love
But I'm apprehensive
She's so expensive
Girl just can't get enough
I'm the one who does 9 to 5
Hustling for my bread
While she's deciding what dress to buy
Laying around in my bed

Refrain:
Going to the bank
She got me, going to the bank
She keeps me running to the bank
She got me, got me

Drives my Mercedes
Lunch with the ladies
She loves the finder things
What have I created
Now I'm afraid to
See what tomorrow brings
She don't know what it does to me
Trying a keep her in line
If love is just a big charge account
Why'd it have to be mine

Refrain: ...

J.D.: Hello
Teller: Oh hi can I help you today
J.D.: Yeah I'd like to make another withdrawal
Teller: Again?
J.D.: Yeah again
Teller: Um, well... as you know by now
There is a substantial penalty for early 
Withdrawal

She knows I love her
Knows how I need her
She knows I really care
I can't afford her
I should've taught her
I ain't no billionaire
Gotta get her to understand
Soon the well will be dry
If she don't love the simple things
Maybe I'm the wrong guy

Refrain: ...

J.D.: She thinks she saves me money
Buying everything on sale
But she believes in quantity
Now I'm afraid to open my mail

Now the girl's gotta look good for me
But this is going too far
'Cause she won't feel so beautiful
When they repossess my car
