Title  : A RAINY NIGHT IN GEORGIA
Artist : RANDY CRAWFORD

(Words & music: Tony Joe White)

Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a-fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin': it's alright

Neon signs a-flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

Chorus:
A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just go to do your own thing

I find me a place in a boxcar
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest, and I'm alright

Chorus: ...
