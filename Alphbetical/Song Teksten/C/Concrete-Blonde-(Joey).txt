Title  : Joey
Singer : Concrete Blonde


Joey, baby - don't get crazy
Detours, fences ... I get defensive
I know you've heard it all before -
So I don't say it anymore
I just stand by and watch you
Fight your secret war
Although I used to wonder why -
I used to cry till I was dry
Still sometimes I get a strange pain inside
Oh, Joey, if you're hurting so am I

Joey, honey - I got some money
All is forgiven, listen, listen
And if I seem to be confused
I didn't mean to be with you
And when you said I scared me too
But we got lucky once before
And if you're somewhere out there
Passed out on the floor
Oh Joey, I'm not angry anymore
