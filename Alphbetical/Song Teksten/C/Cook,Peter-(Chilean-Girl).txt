Title  : CHILEAN GIRL

(Words & music: P. Cook)

It's no use to run away from tomorrow and today
You have to face it
All your problems, all your pain
Put them on the last train
With a one way ticket

Refrain:
Put out the lights
Close your eyes
And listen to my song
Listen to the words I wrote for you
And suddenly you'll find yourself
Together with the one who really loves you
Chilean girl
Who really loves you, Chilean girl
The one who loves you, Chilean girl
Though you're far away from here
In my mind and heart you are near
I wanna touch you

And if you are sometimes insecure
Lovely girl you can be sure
I am always with you

Refrain: ...
