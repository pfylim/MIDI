  CALL MY BABY LOLLIPOP
  TELL YOU WHY
  HER KISS IS SWEETER THAN AN APPLE PIE
  AND WHEN SHE DOES HER SHAKY ROCKIN' DANCE
  MAN, I HAVEN'T GOT A CHANCE
  
  I CALL HER
  
  (CHORUS)
  
  SWEETER CANDY ON A STICK
  HUCKLEBERRY, CHERRY OR LIME
  IF YOU HAD A CHOICE
  SHE'D BE YOUR PICK
  BUT LOLLIPOP IS MINE
  
  (CHORUS)
  
  CRAZY WAY SHE THRILLS ME
  TELL YOU WHY
  JUST LIKE A LIGHTNING FROM THE SKY
  SHE LOVES TO KISS ME TILL I CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT
  GEE, MY LOLLIPOP IS GREAT
  
  I CALL HER
  
  
  (CHORUS REPEAT 1 TIME)
  
  OH LOLLIPOP
