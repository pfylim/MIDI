Titel:            IF LEAVING ME IS EASY

Interpret:        PHIL COLLINS



I read all the letters, I red each word that you've sent to me
and though it's past now, and the words start to fade
all the memories I have, still remain

I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no-one knows
oh sure my friends all come around, but I'm in a crown and on my own
it's 'cos you're gone now, but your heart, still remains
and it'll be here if you come again
you see, I'd heard the rumours, I knew before you let me know

but I didn't belive it, not you,
no you would not let me go
seems I was wrong, but I love, I love you the same
and that's the one thing that you can't take away but just
remember...



(repeat and fade)
if leaving me is easy,
going back is harder
 long enough, you'll do it
hang in long enough.
