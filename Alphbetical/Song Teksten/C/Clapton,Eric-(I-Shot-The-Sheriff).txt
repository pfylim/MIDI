      I shot the Sheriff            Eric Clapton


I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy
I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy.

All around in my home town
They're trying to track me down
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy.
But I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I swear it was in self-defence
I shot the sheriff, and they say it is a capital offence.

Sheriff John Brown always hated me
For what I don't know
Every time that I plant a seed
He said kill it before it grows
He said kill it before it grows
I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy.

Reflexes had got the better of me
and what is to be must be
Every day the bucket goes to the well
One day the bottom will drop out
Yes, one day the bottom will drop out
And I say:

I shot the sheriff, but I didn't shoot no deputy.
