Title  : ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN

(Words & music: Castricum/Krom/Kruisman)

I'd rather be a stranger
Than one of the president's men
I ain't no palace pal, oh no

I'd rather be a teenage tiger
Than shaking hands with congress men
I'm on the run for a first lady like you

It didn't come from way up above
It wasn't written in the national law
That you're a princess in faded blue jeans
And I'm in love

I wanna hold you
I'm gonna love ye
You're so flashy, I'd say you shoot

I don't have to rape or murder
I don't have a pistol or a knife
I don't have to bug you to get you into my life

Id' rather be a teenage tiger
Than one of the president's men
I ain't no palace pal, oh no

I wanna love ye
I'm gonna hold ye tight
You're so flashy
I'd say you shoot
I wanna love ye
I wanna hold ye tight
You're shooting me right back to my roots
