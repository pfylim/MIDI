1. SOLDIER, SOLDIER - CAPTAIN JACK

Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
I`m here for you in every town.
Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
I`m here for you in every town.

Mama told Mary not to go downtown.
Too many lovely boys hanging around.
Mary didn`t listen. She went anyway.
There she met a boy who took her away.
Mmm

Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
I`m here for you in every town.

Chorus
Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
There`s no sixpack on the ground.
There`s no sixpack on the ground.
Soldier, soldier don`t look up.
Soldier, soldier don`t look up.
There`s no hawk gonna pick you up.
There`s no hawk gonna pick you up.

Mama is worried and she gets real loud.
Soldiers are a dirty crowd.
Don`t be mad. I love him so.
It`s my life and I had to go.

Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
I`m here for you in every town.

Chorus

Three month later all was well.
In my dreams I hear the wedding bells.
Six month later all was done.
We had a little son. We are having fun.
Mama don`t think twice.
Soldiers can`t be nice.

Soldier, soldier don`t look down.
I`m here for you in every town.

Chorus 2x
