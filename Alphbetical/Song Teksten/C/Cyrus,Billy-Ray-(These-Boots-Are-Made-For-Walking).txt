And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.

You keep lyin when you ought to be truthin
And you keep losin when you ought to not bet
You keep samin when you ought to be a' changin
Now what's right is right
But you ain't been right yet

And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.
