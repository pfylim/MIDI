13. Zombie - The Cranberries

Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly tired
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see it's not me
It's not my family
In your head in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head
They are crying

In your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie
What's in your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie
Oh oh tu-tu-tu-tu-tu...

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head in your head
They're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs
And their bombs and their guns
In your head in your head
They are dying

In your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie
What's in your head in your head
Zombie zombie zombie
Oh oh oh oh...
