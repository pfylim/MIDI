       One More Dance In Blue        Howard Carpendale                         
                          
                        
            
Stopped to rest, I'd been driving all night, smoked a cigarette,
Turned out the dash board lights and then I saw her.
Her eyes sent shivers running down my spine,
The wind was singing through the telephone lines, then I saw her.

She looked so much like you,
She smiled the way you do, I was so alone.
She laughed a little wild like a crazy crazy child
A long long way from home.
And with a voice so clear she whispered in my ear :

One more dance in blue,
One more night with you till the morning light.
One more dance in blue,
I'll come back to you, it'll be alright.
And I'll back for you after one more dance in blue.

Took her in my arms and I held her tight,
Magic in the way that we danced all nihght, can you feel it ?
She said : Take my hand, we can follow the light,
Burning like a fire in the dead of the night, can you feel it ?

Stopped to rest, I'd been driving all night, smoked a cigarette.
