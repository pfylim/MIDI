Title  : SAILING
Artist : CHRISTOPHER CROSS

(Words & music: Christopher Cross)

It's not far down to paradise
(It's not far back to sanity)
At least it's not for me
And if the wind is right
You can sail away
And find tranquility
(And find serenity)
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

It's not far to neverneverland
No reason to pretend
And if the wind is right
You can find the joy
Of innnocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles
Just you wait and see
Believe me

Chorus:
Sailing, takes me away
To where I've always heard it would be
Just a dream
And the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

Fantasy it's get the best of me
When I'm sailing
All caught up in the reverie
Ev'ry word is a symphony
Won't you believe me

Chorus: ...
