We never talked about it
but I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
but I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cos I love you, but I can't take any more
there's a look I can't describe in your eyes
yes we could try, like we tried before
when you kept on telling me those lies

Do you remember... ?

There seemed no way to make up
'cos it seemed your mind was set
and the way you looked it told me
it's a look I know I'll never forget

You could've come over to my side
you could have let me know
you could have tried to see the distance between us
but it seemed too far for you to go

Do you remember... ?

Through all of my life
in spite of all the pain
you know people are funny sometimes
'cos they just can't wait
to get hurt again

Tell me do you remember... ?

These are things we won't recall
feelings we'll never find
it's taken so long to see it
cos we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
more important to say
but I love you, wasn't one of these things
and now it's too late

Do you remember... ?
