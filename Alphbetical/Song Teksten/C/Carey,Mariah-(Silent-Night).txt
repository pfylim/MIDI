11. SILENT NIGHT - MARIAH CAREY

Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round you virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh love's pure light
Radiant beams from
The holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Oh Jesus Lord at Thy birth

Sleep
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly place
Sleep in heavenly place
Sleep in heavenly place
Peace
Sleep
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly place
