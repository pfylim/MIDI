TAKE THE CHANCE
GIVING ALL THAT YOU CAN
'COS HE DOESN'T FEEL A THING OF YOU
YOU CAN TRY TO MOVE ALONG
SO NOTHING WILL GO WRONG
MAYBE HE WILL BE BACK
TO SEARCH FOR YOU
BACK ON TRACK IT'S ME YEAH, FIXXIT
I PROVED MY POINT NOW WE MIX IT
YEAH THE A-DOUBLE I STAR FRESH AND I GOT
2GETHER
2 MAKE THE TRACK FLOW BETTER
THAT'S WHY WE STAND STRONG
NOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S UP
IF I'M ON THE MOVE I CAN'T STOP
THE BEAT IS SIMPLE BUT YOU CAN'T REFUSE IT

THAT'S WHY I LOVE MUSIC

'COS HE DOESN'T FEEL A THING FOR YOU
YOU CAN TRY TO MOVE ALONG
SO NOTHING WILL GO WRONG
MAYBE HE WILL BE BACK
TO SEARCH FOR YOU
AGAIN AND AGAIN I KEEP GOING WITH THE SWING
