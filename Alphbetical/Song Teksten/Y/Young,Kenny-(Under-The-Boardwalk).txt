When the sun beats down and melts the tar upon the roof.
And your shoes get so hot, 
you wish your tired feet were fire proof.

Under the Boardwalk down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby's where I'll be.
Under the Boardwalk out of the sun,
under the Boardwalk havin' some fun,
under the Boardwalk people walkin above,
under the Boardwalk we'll be makin' love,
under the Boardwalk.

From the park you hear the happy sound of carousel.
And you can almost taste the hotdogs 
and French fries they sell.

Under the Boardwalk down by the sea
on a blanket with my baby's where I'll be.
Under the Boardwalk out of the sun,
under the Boardwalk havin' some fun,
under the Boardwalk people walkin above,
under the Boardwalk we'll be makin' love,
under the Boardwalk.
