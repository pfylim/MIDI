PAUL YOUNG - EVERY TIME YOU GO AWAY

Hey if we can solve any problems
Why do we lose so many tears
Oh so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same theme
But can't you see
We've got ev'rything going on and on and on

Refrain:
Ev'ry time you go away
You take a piece of me with you oh
And ev'ry time you go away
You take a piece of me with you oh

(You) go on and go free
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
But does it mean that much to me
I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause can't you see
We've got ev'rything baby
Even though you know

I can't go on singing the same theme
'Cause baby can't you see
We've got ev'rything going on and on and on
