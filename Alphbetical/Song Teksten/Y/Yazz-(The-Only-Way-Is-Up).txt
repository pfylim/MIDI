YAZZ - THE ONLY WAY IS UP

(Words & music: G. Jackson/J. Henderson)

Ah oh
We've been broken down
To the lowest turn
Been on the bottom line
Sure ain't no fun
But if we would be evicted
Ha from our homes
We'll just move somewhere else
And still carry on

Ah (hold on) hold on (hold on) hold on
(Hold on) ooh ah baby
(Hold on) hold on (hold on)
Ooh ooh eah eah (yeah)

Refrain:
The only way is up baby
For you and me now
The only way is up baby
For you and me now

Ah yeah
Now we may not know ah ah
Where our next meal is coming from
But with you by my side
I'll face what is to come
Oh boy I wanna thank you
Yeah for loving me this way
Things may be a little hard now
But we'll find a brighter day

Ah yeah (hold on)
Hold on (hold on) hold on
(Hold) ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Hold on) hold on (hold on)
Won't be long ah yeah (yeah)

Refrain: ...

Ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah
The only way is up baby
Talking 'bout the only way
Talking 'bout the only way is up baby
Talking 'bout the only way
Talking 'bout the only way is up baby

Hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on)
(Hold on) hey
(Hold on) hold on (hold on)
Won't be long no no babe

Refrain: ...2x...
