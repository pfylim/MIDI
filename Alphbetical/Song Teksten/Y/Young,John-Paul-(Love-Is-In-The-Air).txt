Title  : LOVE IS IN THE AIR

(Words & music: Vanda/Young)

Love is in the air
Everywhere I look around
Love is in the air
Every sight and every sound
And I don't know if I'm being foolish
Don't know if I'm being wise
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when I look in your eyes

Love is in the air
In the whisper of a tree
Love is in the air
In the thunder of the sea
And I don't know if I'm just dreaming
Don't know if I feel sane
But it's something that I must believe in
And it's there when you call out my name

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
Ooh, ooh

Love is in the air
In the rising of the sun
Love is in the air
When the day is nearly done
And I don't know if you're illusioned
Don't know if I see true
But you're something that I must believe in
And you're there when I reach out for you

Love is in the air
Love is in the air
