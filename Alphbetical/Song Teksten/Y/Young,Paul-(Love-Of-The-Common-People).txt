Title  : Love Of The Common People
Singer : Paul Young


Living on freefood tickets
Water in the milk from the hole
In the roof where the rain came through
What can you do
Ooh, tears from your little sister
Crying 'Cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh, but you know she'll get by
Because she's living

Chorus:
In the love of the common people
Smile from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
And mama's gonna love her just as much as she can
As she can

It's a good thing you don't have busfare
It would fall thru the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground
You walk into town to find a job
Tryin' to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come thru
And it chills you to the bone
Boy, you better go home where it's warm

Chorus

Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You take 'em in stride for family pride
You know that faith is your foundation
And with a whole lot of love
And a warm conversation and of course
There's prayer making you strong where you belong
Where you can live

Chorus
