                             GROOVIN'                        

     As performed by: The Young Rascals     1967 Downtown Music Co.                                     


     Groovi-in'...on a Sunday afternoo-oon........
     Really-y,...couldn't get away too soo-oon........
     I can't imagine any--thing that's better,..
     the world is ours when ever..we're to-gether..
     There ain't a place I'd like to be, it's there-ere, oh!

     Movin'...down a crowded avenue-ue........
     Doin...anything we'd like to do........
     There's always lots of things that..we can see-ee...
     We can be anyone we'd like to be-e..
     There's all those happy people we could meet, just!

     Groovin'...on a Sunday afternoo-oon........
     Really-y,...couldn't get away too soon,...no-no-no-no!....
     ah-ha-ha...ah-ha-ha...ah-ha-haaa-----aah--haa

     We'll keep on spendin' sunny days this way-ay..(aaah--aah)
     We're gonna talk and laugh our..time a-way-ay..(aha--haa)
     I feel it comin' closer day by day..
     Life will be ecstasy, you and me, an' let's leave!

     Groovin'...on a Sunday afternoo-oon........
     Really-y,...couldn't get away too soon...no-no-no--no!.....
     groovin',..ah-ha-ha-ha..groovi-in',...groovin'.....
