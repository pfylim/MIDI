SYDNEY YOUNGBLOOD - IF ONLY I COULD

(Words & music: S. Youngblood/R. Hamm/M. Stabb/C. Zundel)

Everybody all around the world
Stand up all my brothers
Joining our hands
United we're stronger
Fighting for our peace
Caring about loved ones
Trusting ourselves
Sharing our feelings
Believe me

If only I could I'd make this world a better place
If only I could I'd make this world a better place
Ooh believe me, believe me, believe me, believe
If only I could

I think about the implications
When alone between the sheets
When all the huggin' and kissin'
Is tearing my heart apart
All people standin' hand in hand
Celebratin' all different colors
Joining together
Sharing their feelings
Please believe me

Ooh believe me, believe me, believe me, believe
If only I could I'd make this world a better place
If only I could I'd make this world a better place
If only I could

Mmm believe me, believe me, believe me, believe
If only I could
