Title  : HOT SHOT

(Words & music: A. Kahn/K. Borusiewicz)

When I'm sitting home
And I'm all alone
And I don't hear no phone
I need a hot shot

When I'm with the crowd
And we're feeling proud
Had the music loud
I need a shot

My fire is burning
It's getting real hot
You know that I need me a shot

When I'm off the street
And I feel the beat
That drives me out my seat
I need a shot

When it's late at night
And I ain't feeling right
And there ain't no man in sight
I need a hot shot

My fire is burning
It's getting real hot
You know that I need me a shot

I need hot shot
Hot shot, hot shot, shot
Hot shot, hot shot, shot
