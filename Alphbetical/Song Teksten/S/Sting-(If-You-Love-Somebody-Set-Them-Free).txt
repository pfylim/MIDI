STING - IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY SET THEM FREE


Free free set them free oh oh
Free free set them free oh
Free free set them free
Free free set them free

If you need somebody (free free set them free)
Call my name (free free set them free)
If you want someone (free free set them free)
You can do the same (free free set them free)
If you want to keep something precious
(free free set them free)
Got to lock it up and throw away the key
(free free set them free)
If you want to hold on to your possession
Don't even think about me (free free set them free)

If you love somebody, if you love someone
If you love somebody, if you love someone
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)

If it's a mirror you want just look into my eyes
Or a whipping boy someone to despise
Or a prisoner in the dark tied up
in chains you just can't see
Or a beast in a gilded cage that's
all some people ever want to be

Refrain:
If you love somebody (love somebody)
If you love someone (love someone)
If you love somebody (love somebody)
If you love someone (love someone)
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)
Set them free (free free set them free)

You can't control an independent heart
(can hold but you can't keep)
Can't tear the one you love apart
(can love but you can't keep)
Forever conditioned to believe that we can't live
We can't live here and be happy with less
So many riches so many souls
Everything we see that we want to possess

If you need somebody
Call my name
If you want someone you can do
You can do, you can do the same
If you want to keep something precious
You got to lock it up and throw away the key
If you want to hold on to your possessions
Don't even think about me

Refrain: ...

Set them free (free free set them free)
