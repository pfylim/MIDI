Title  : STRAY CATS STRUT
Artist : STRAY CATS

(Words & music: Dave Edmunds/Brian Setzer)

Black and orange stray cats, sitting on a fence
Ain't got enough dough to pay the rent
I'm a flat broke, but I don't care
I struck right by with my tail in the air

Chorus:
Stray cats strut
Stray cats
All feel a Casanova
He's great outside
Gets a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man
Getting my dinner from a garbage can

I don't bother chasing mice around
Well done
I slipped down the alley, looking for a fight
Howlin' tot the moon at a hot summer night
Singing the blues while the lady gets cry
Miaauw, stray cat
You're a real wrong guy
I wish I could be as Kevin Wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style

I don't bother chasing mice around
I slipped down the alley, looking for a fight
Howlin' to the moon  on a hot summer night
Singing the blues while the lady gets cry
Miaauw, stray cat
You're a real wrong guy
I wish I could be as Kevin Wild
But I got cat class and I got cat style
