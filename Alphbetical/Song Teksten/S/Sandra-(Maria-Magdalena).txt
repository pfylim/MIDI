    Maria Magdalena       Sandra 


You take my love , you want my soul .
I would be crazy to share your life ,
why can't you see what I am ?
Sharpen your senses just like a knife ,
hurt me and you'll understand :

Refr. I'll never be Maria Magdalena
      ( you're a creature of the night )
      Maria Magdalena 
      ( You're a victim of the fight )
      ( you need love )
      promise me delight 
      ( you need love )
     
      I'll never be Maria Magdalena ...

Why must I lie , find an advice .
When will you wake up and realize
I can't surrender to you .
Live for affection and win the price ,
I know those ugly games , too .

Refr. I'll never be Maria Magdalena ...
      I'll never be Maria Magdalena ...

Oooh , Oooh , Oooh , ...

Refr. I'll never be Maria Magdalena ...
