Title  : LAY BACK IN THE ARMS OF SOMEONE

(Words & music: Nicky Chinn/Mike Chapman)

If you want my sympathy
Just open your heart to me
You'll get whatever you'll need
You think that's too high for you
Oh but baby, I would die for you
When there's nothing left
You know where I'll be

Refrain:
You lay back in the arms of someone
You give in to the charms of someone
You lay back in the arms of someone you love
You lay back in the arms of someone
When you feel you're a part of someone
You lay back in the arms of someone you love

So baby, just call on me
When you want all of me
I'll be your lover, I'll be your friend
There is nothing that I won't do
'Cause baby, I just live for you
With nothing to hide
No need to pretend

Refrain: ...

You think that's too high for you
Oh but baby, I would die for you
When there's nothing left
You know where I'll be

Refrain: ...
