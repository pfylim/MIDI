Title  : NO NO, SHERIFF

(Words & music: K. Dandy)

Sheriff:
This is the sheriff speaking
C'mon out boy, you're surrounded
Just give yourself up

Gangster:
You son of a bitch
Come in and get me

Emly:
People call him a bad man
But I can call him love
My my my sweet love
My my my sweet love

Sheriff:
Now don't be a damned fool
Come out with your hands in the air

Emly:
They never gave him a fair break
Never give him love
My my my sweet love
My my my sweet love

Chorus:
I said no no no sheriff
Don't shoot my guy
No no sheriff please don't
No no sheriff don't shoot my guy
He's the one I love
He's the one I love
Sheriff, please I beg you

Sheriff:
Sorry ma'am it's my duty

Emly:
All they gave him was bad times
When he needed love
My my my sweet love
My my my sweet love

Chorus: ...2x...

Sheriff:
Now listen boy and listen good
If you don't come out in ten seconds
I'll get you some dynamite 
And blow you to kingdom come

Chorus: ...4x...
