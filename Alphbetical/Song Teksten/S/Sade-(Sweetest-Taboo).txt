SADE - SWEETEST TABOO

If I tell you, if I tell you now
Will you keep on loving me
If I tell you, if I tell you how I feel
Will you keep bringing out the best in me

You give me
You give me the sweetest taboo
You give me
You give me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
That is you
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
You're giving me something that's taboo

You give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me the sweetest taboo
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
I'd do anything for you
I'd stand out in the rain
Anything you want me to do
Don't let it slip away

There's a quiet storm
And it never felt like this before
There's a quiet storm
I think it's you
There's a quiet storm
And it never felt this hot before
You're giving me something that's taboo
You can give me the sweetest taboo
That's why I'm in love with you
You give me
You're giving me the sweetest taboo
Too good for me

You've got the biggest heart
Sometimes I think you're just too good for me
Every day it's Christmas
And every night it's New Years Eve
