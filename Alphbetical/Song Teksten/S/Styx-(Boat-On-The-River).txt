4. BOAT ON THE RIVER - STYX

Take me back to my boat on the river
I need to go down, I need to calm down
Take me back to my boat on the river and I won't cry out anymore.
Time stands still as I gaze in the water
Trees ease me down, touchin' me gently
The water that flow pass my boat on the river
So I don't cry out anymore.
Oh, the river is wise, the river it touches my life
Like the waves on the sand
Long roads lead to tranquillity base
Where the frown on my face disappears
Take me down to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out anymore.
Oh, the river is deep, the river it touches my life
Like the waves on the sand,
Long roads lead to tranquillity base
Where the frown on my face disappears
Take me down to my boat on the river
I need to go down, wouldn't you let me go down
Take me back to my boat on the river
And I won't cry out anymore
And I won't cry out anymore
And I won't cry out anymore
