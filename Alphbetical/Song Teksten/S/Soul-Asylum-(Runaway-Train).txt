                      R U N A W A Y  T R A I N

  Call you up in the middle of the night

  Like a firefly without a light

  You were there like a blowtorch burning

  I was a key that could use a little turning

  
  So tired that I even couldn't sleep

  So many secrets I couldn't keep

  Promised myself I wouldn't weep

  One more promise I couldn't keep


  It seems no one can help me now

  I'm in too deep there's no way out

  This time I have really led myself astray


  RUNAWAY TRAIN NEVER GOING BACK

  WRONG WAY ON A ONE WAY TRACK

  SEEMS LIKE I SHOULD BE GETTING SOMEWHERE

  SOMEHOW I'M NEITHER HERE NOR THERE


  Can you help me remember how to smile

  make it somehow all seem worthwhile

  How on earth did I get so jaded

  Life's mystery seems so faded


  I can go where no one else can go

  I know what no one else knows

  Here I am just drowning in the rain

  With a ticket for a runaway train


  Everything seems cut and dry, day and night, earth and sky

  Somehow I.........just don't believe it

  R E F R E I N

  Bought a ticket for a runaway train

  Like a madman laughing in the rain

  Little out of touch,little insane

  Just easier than dealing with the pain


  R E F R E I N


  RUNAWAY TRAIN NEVER COMING BACK

  RUNAWAY TRAIN TEARING UP THE TRACK

  RUNAWAY TRAIN BURNING IN MY VEINS

  RUNAWAY BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS THE SAME
