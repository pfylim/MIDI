  13. STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA (B. SPRINGSTEEN)
  
  
  I WAS BRUISED AND BATTERED
  I COULDN'T TELL WHAT I FELT
  I WAS UNRECOGNIZABLE TO MYSELF
  I SAW MY REFLECTION
  IN A WINDOW
  I DIDN'T KNOW MY OWN FACE
  OH BROTHER ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE ME
  WASTIN' AWAY
  ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA
  
  I WALKED THE AVENUE
  'TIL MY LEGS
  FELT LIKE STONE
  I HEARD THE VOICES OF FRIENDS
  VANISHED AND GONE
  AT NIGHT I COULD HEAR
  THE BLOOD IN MY VEINS
  BLACK AND WHISPERING AS THE RAIN
  ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA
  
  AIN'T NO ANGEL
  GONNA GREET ME
  IT'S JUST YOU AND I
  MY FRIEND
  MY CLOTHES
  DON'T FIT ME NO MORE
  I WALKED A THOUSAND MILES
  JUST TO SLIP THIS SKIN
  
  THE NIGHT HAS FALLEN
  I'M LYIN' AWAKE
  I CAN FEEL MYSELF
  FADING AWAY
  SO RECEIVE ME BROTHER
  WITH YOUR FAITHLESS KISS
  OR WILL WE LEAVE EACH OTHER
  ALONE LIKE THIS
  ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA
