Title  : CONTACT

(Words & music: Puhan Dickerson)

Across the crowded disco room through a maze of fancy people
She sat so quiet and all alone, gonna catch the disco fever
And then she raised her head, her eyes caught mine
And that was all that I needed in her eyes
I saw the need for love, warm soft pleading eye to eye contact
Eye to eye contact, eye to eye contact, you and me
I was lookin' at you, you were lookin' at me

Across the crowded room here eyes told me a story
My heart was beating like a drum
I fought my way over
I never took my eyes away from yours
Not even a moment
What I saw in your eyes made me realize
You I wanted
Eye to eye contact, eye to eye contact, you and me
I was lookin' at you, you were lookin' at me
