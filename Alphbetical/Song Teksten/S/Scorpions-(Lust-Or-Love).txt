The innocence is gone
but still I'm holding on
searchin' for love that lasts forever
lookin' for a place
where love can hide away
takin' a chance it's now or never.

Maybe it's time to draw the line
there's just one thing that's on my mind.

Is it lust, is it love
whatever it is I can't get enough
is it lust, is it love
when I look around tell me who can I trust
is it love.

Lovers come and  go
sometimes it's hard to know
if this will be a night to treasure
when the damage has been done
and the hurting has begun
you'll justify a moment's pleasure.

Maybe it's time to draw the line
there's just one thing that's on my mind.

Is it lust, is it love
whatever it is I can't get enough
is it lust, is it love
it ain't nothin' that I can't rise above
is it lust, is it love
when I look around tell me who can I trust
is it love, is it love
lust or love.

Maybe it's time to draw the line
there's just one thing that's on my mind.

Is it lust, is it love
whatever it is I can't get enough
is it lust, is it love
it ain't nothin' that I can't rise above
is it lust, is it love
still lookin' for more, it's never enough
is it lust, is it love
when I look around tell me who can I trust
is it love, is it love, is it love,
is it love, is it love.
