CROSS MY BROKEN HEART - SINITTA


t look like I was
    a fool about him
My friend told me he would
   break my heart
I just kept thinking that he
   really loved me
And hed never wanna see us break apart

But last night I was talking
   with my best friend
She said she had something
   to say to me and then

   She told me secret
   I promised that I'd keep it
   Cross my heart and
       hope to die
   The boy she was meeting
   Was my guy he was cheating
   Cross my broken heart
       And said goodbye

It seems like I was
   so wrong about you
It looks like I'm
   gonna get hurt again
And I'm gonna have to get by
   without you
Right back here on my own again

'Cause last night I was talking
   with my best friend
She said she had something 
   to say to me and then

   She told me secret
   I promised that I'd keep it
   Cross my heart and
       hope to die
   The boy she was meeting
   Was my guy he was cheating
   Cross my broken heart
       And said goodbye

Promise a secret
Promise a secret
Promise a secret
Promise a secret
Promise a secret
