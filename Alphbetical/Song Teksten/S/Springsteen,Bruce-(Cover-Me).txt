The times are tough now
just getting tougher
this old world is rough
it's just getting rougher
cover me
come on baby, cover me
well I'm looking for a lover who will
come on in and cover me.

Promise me baby you won't let them
find us
hold me in your arms
let's let our love blind us
cover me
shut the door and cover me
well I'm looking for a lover who will
come on in and cover me.

Outside's the rain, the driving snow
I can hear the wild wind blowing
turn out the light
bolt the door
I ain't going out there no more
this whole world is out there
just trying to score
I've seen enough I don't want to see any more
cover me
come on and cover me
I'm looking for a lover who will
come on in and cover me.
Looking for a lover who will
come on in and cover me.
me and Wayne might do.
