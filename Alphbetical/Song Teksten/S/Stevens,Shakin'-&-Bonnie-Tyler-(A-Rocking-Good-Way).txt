SHAKIN' STEVENS & BONNIE TYLER - A ROCKING GOOD WAY

If you're gonna give me good kisses like that
Honey don't you know I'm gonna give them right back
'Cause that's a kissing good way
That's a kissing good way
To mess around and fall in love

Ooh if you're gonna start out hugging me tight
Don't mess around, come and hug me right
'Cause that's a hugging good way
That's a hugging good way
To mess around and fall in love

You know you called me on the phone
Just because I was alone
Ah, you came around a-wooing
You better ask somebody if you don't
know what you're doing

Now that you've kissed me and you rocked my soul
Don't come round knocking rock'n'roll
'Cause that's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way
To mess around and fall in love
Don't fall in love
Don't fall in love

Well now you called me on the phone
And just because I was alone
You came around wooing
Ah, you better ask somebody if you
don't know what you're doing

Ah, you kiss me and you rock my soul
Don't come around knocking rock'n'roll
'Cause that's a rocking good way
Shaky, that's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way to mess
around and fall in love, yeah
It's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way
Mmmm, that's a rocking good way
That's a rocking good way to mess
around and fall in love
