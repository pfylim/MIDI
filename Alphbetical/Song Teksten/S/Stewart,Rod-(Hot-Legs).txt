Title  : HOT LEGS

(Words & music: Rod Stewart)

Who's that knocking on my door
It's gotta be a quarter to four
Is it you or them coming 'round for more
Well you can love me tonight if you want
But in the morning make sure you're gone
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, though you're still at school
I love you, honey

Got a most persuading tongue
You promise all kinds of fun
But what you don't understand
I'm a working man
Gonna need a shot of vitamin A
By the time you're finished with me
I'm talking to you
Hot legs, you're an alley cat
Hot legs, you can scratch my back
Hot legs, bring your mother too
I love you, honey

Reckon how my daddy felt
In your jet leg suspender belt
Seventeen years old instead of sixty four
You got legs right up to your neck
You're making me physical wreck
I'm talking  to you
Hot legs, in your satin shoes
Hot legs, though you're still at school
Hot legs, you're making me a fool
I love you, honey

Hot legs, making your marks
Hot legs, keep your hands to yourself
I love you, honey

Hot legs, you're wearing me out
Hot legs, you can scream and shout
Hot legs, you're still at school
I love you, honey
