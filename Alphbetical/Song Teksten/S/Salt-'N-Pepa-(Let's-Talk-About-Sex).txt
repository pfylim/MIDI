Refrain

Let's talk about sex, baby, let's talk about you and me,
let's talk about all the good things, all the bad things that may be,
let's talk about sex, let's talk about sex,
let's talk about sex, let's talk about sex.

Let's talk about sex for now, to the people at home or in the crowd,
it keeps comin' up anyhow.
Don't be quoi, oh boy, a mad boy, that's stupid,
'cause anyone is stupid, now !
Talk about sex on the radio and video-show, many people, anything goes.
Let's tell it like it is and how it could be,
how it was and of course how it should be.
Don't you think it's dirty, have a toy,
pin up the needle, press 'tall and turn the radio on.
For that stuff is an, oh dammin', allright thing, come on, spin !

Refrain


Sprechgesang

She hadn't all the bad, so she should have been glad,
but she was mad and sad and feeling bad,
thinkin' about the things that she never had,
no love just sex, bothered next with a cheque and the notes,
the last night was dope.

Refrain


Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me up, come on, all the ladies,
Let's talk about sex, allright.
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me up, come on, all the ladies,
Let's talk about sex, allright.
You're pell, I don't think they play this on the radio,
Ehm, why not, everybody have sex,
I mean everybody should be makin' love,
Come on, I know guys you would't make love to.
