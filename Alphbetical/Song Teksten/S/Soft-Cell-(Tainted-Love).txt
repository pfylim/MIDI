                 Tainted Love              Soft Cell 


Sometimes I feel I've got to run away , I've got to get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me.
The love we share seems to go nowhere ,
And I've lost my light for I toss and turn - I can't sleep at night.

Refrain 

Once I ran to you , now I'll run from you ,
This tainted love you've given -
I give you all a boy could give you.
Take my tears and that's not living -
OH , tainted love - tainted love .

Now I know I've got to run away , I've got to get away.
You don't really want it any more from me -
To make things right you need someone to hold you tight,
And you'll think love is to pray but I'm sorry I don't pray that way.

Refrain 

Once I ran to you ...

Don't touch me please - I cannot stand the way you tease.
I love you though you hurt me so,
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go. Tainted love - tainted love ...
