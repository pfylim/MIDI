I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
yes I would, if I could, I surely would.
Hm hm.
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail 
yes I would, if I only could, I surely would.
Hm hm.
Away I'd rather sail away like a swan that's
here and gone.
A man gets tied up to the ground he gives the
world it's sadest sound,
it's sadest sound, hm hm.

I'd rather be a forest than a street
yes I would, if I could, I surely would.
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
yes I would, If I only could, I surely would.
