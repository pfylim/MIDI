9. She's A River - Simple Minds

Shadow let go There's something you should know I just found my
New direction and I hope you like the key like the air that led me to
It She's the wind that sucked me through it She's a river and she's
Turning there in front of me.
Stand back - get back she'll paint your blue skies black She gives
Bullet proof protection She's got a resurrection feel when I'm
Scared and 'bout to lose She gives me travelling shoes She's a river
And she's turning there in front of me
And I go blind Wasting my time the rivers in front of me that's
Where I'm goin' to be
Shine on, get on twilight from dusk and dawn she's the spirit of
Creation she's the last change guarantee got a myriad of poses
Sweet miracles and roses She's a river and she's turning there 
In front of me
Shine on, muove on cos when I find my state of mind
The river's in front of me
Move on let it go
They say that every heaven's got a thousand rooms so take me on
That freedom ride my heart is like a hunter's in the silent moon my
Nerves feel electrified meet me on the staircase by a darkened room
Light me like a naked flame the voice of mother nature states
All things must pass
Nothing here can remain they say that every heaven's got a
Thousand rooms so take me on that freedom ride
You rise me like a building to the very top Rush me to the end of
Time you fill me full of danger you gave me future shock then you
Leave me wasted dying
Stand back get back move on She's a river, she's a river
