             This Time I Know It's For Real                               
                          
                                    
What would I have to do to get you to notice me, too ?
Do I stand in line one of a milion admiring eyes ?
Walk a tightrope way up high, write you name across the sky.
                                    
I'm going crazy just to let you know,
You'd be amazed how much I love you so, oh baby,
When I get my hands on you I won't let go, 
This time I know it's for real !

Should I write or call your home ? Shout it out with a megaphone !
Radio, TV news, got to find a way to get the message to you.
To say I love you with a neon sign, anything to make you mine,

I'm going crazy just to let you know,
If I wait too long for you I might explore, oh baby.
I've been around the blockenough to know,
This time I know it's for real !

Ooh baby - this time, this time, this time, this time -
Oh baby - this time, this time, oh baby.
Walk a tightrope way up high,
Write your name across the sky.
