Title  : THE SHOW MUST GO ON

Baby, although I chose this lonely life
It seems it's strangling me now
All the wild men with big cigars
and gigantic cars
They're all laughing at me now
Oh I've been used, oh hoo!
I've been taken for a fool
Oh what a fool
I broke all the rules, oh yeah!
But I won't let the show go on

Baby there's an enormous crowd of people
and they're all after my blood
I wish maybe they'd tear down the walls
of this theatre and let me out
Let me out!
Oh, I've been blind, oh yeah
I've wasted time, wasted
wasted so much time
Walking on the wire, the wire
But I won't let the show go on
Baby I wish you'd help me escape
And help me get away
Leave me outside my address
Far away from this masquerade
I've been so used
I've been so abused
I've been a fool, I broke all the rules
I've been so used, oh and abused
But I won't let the show go on
No, I won't let the show
No, I won't let the show go on
