Title  : WE'LL GO OUT TONIGHT
Artist : DANIEL SAHULEKA

(Words & music: Daniel Sahuleka)

Got to meet some people
Got to hear some jokes now
We'll go to get out of this ol' groove
Every once in a while everybody needs a change
Another mood, another groove got to be arranged
And when I see those idle people
They are all dressed up, ready for tonight
Gotta get away, out of this lonely mood
I gotta be one of these tonite

Chorus:
We'll go out tonight
And it's about time
Things will be alright
Well it's about time
We'll go out tonight
And it's about time
Things will be alright

Gonna start with my lady
A brand new life again
Gonna have some fun while the night is young
Been sitting around too long in this little town
Gonna see the city lights and boogie down
And all those times of having bad luck
I just have to learn to hide myself
Almost forgotten there is a tomorrow
Can't stay forever with my sorrow

Chorus: ...

We've been too long about ourselves
We've been locked up in our shells
But now the moment has arrived
Come on, we're going out tonight
