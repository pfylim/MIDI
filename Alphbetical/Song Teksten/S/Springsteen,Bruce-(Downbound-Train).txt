I had a job, I had a girl
I had something going mister in this world
I got laid off down at the lumber yard
our love went bad, times got hard
now I work down at the carwash,
where all it ever does is rain
don't you feel like you're a rider on a
downbound train.

She just said "Joe I gotta go, we had it
once we ain't got it anymore"
she packed her bags left me behind
she bought a ticket on the Central Line
nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining
I feel her kiss in the misty rain
and I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train.

Last night I heard your voice
you were crying, crying
you were so alone
you said your love had never died
you were waiting for me at home
put on my jacket, I ran through the woods
I ran till I thought my chest would explode.

There in the clearing, beyond the highway,
in the moonlight,
our wedding house shone
I rushed through the yard
I burst through the front door
my head pounding hard.

Up the stairs I climbed, the room was dark,
our bed was empty
then I heard that long whistle whine
and I dropped to my knees,
hung my head and cried.

Now I swing a sledge hammer on a
railroad gang knocking down them cross
ties; working in the rain
now don't it feel like you're a rider on a
downbound train.
