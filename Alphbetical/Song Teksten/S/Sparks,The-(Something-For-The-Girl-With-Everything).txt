Title  : SOMETHING FOR THE GIRL WITH EVERYTHING

Something for the girl with everything
See the writing's on the wall
You bought the girl a wall
Complete with matching ballpointpen
You can breathe another day
Secure in knowing she won't break you (yet)
Something for the girl with everything

Have another sweet my dear
Don't try to talk my dear
Your tiny little mouth is full
Here's a flavour you ain't tried
You shouldn't try to talk
Your mouth is full
Something for the girl with everything

Three wise men are here
Three wise men are here
Bearing the gifts to aid amnesia
She knows everything
She knows everything
She knew you way back
When you weren't yourself
Something for the girl with everything

Here's a really pretty car
I hope it takes you far
I hope it takes you fast and far
Wow the engine's really loud
Nobody's gonna hear a thing you say
Something for the girl with everything

Three wise men are here
Three wise men are here
Where you should they leave
These imported gimmicks
Leave them anywhere
Leave them anywhere
Make sure that there's
A clear path to the door

Something for the girl with everything (4x)
Three wise men are here (4x)

Here's a partridge in a tree
A gardener for the tree
Complete with on-i-tho-lo-gist
Careful, careful with that crate
You wouldn't want to dent Sinatra, no
Something for the girl
Who has got everything

Hey come out and say hello
Before our friends all go
But say no more than just hello
Ah, the little girl is shy
You see of late she's been quite speechless
Very speechless, she's got everything
