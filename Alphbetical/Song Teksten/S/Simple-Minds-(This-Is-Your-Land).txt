SIMPLE MINDS - THIS IS YOUR LAND

This is your land, it's the way it was planned
Sky to the sea something to se
Old ancient town to the old people ground
I wanna know something to go

refrain:
This is your land
Laid out in your hand
This is your land
Wherever I go
Way down here I know
This is your land
Oh churches'n'steeples big city people
I wanna know something to hold
Walk down the track to the old railroad track
I wanna leave something to see

refrain: ...

Money can't buy me money can't buy me
I've got time, time is on my side

You don't know what you've got
Till the whole thing's gone
The days are dark and the road is long
And when you walk away the hope is gone
Tell me what is right what is wrong
Is this the way it was planned

Ah this is your land
Take it in your hand
This is your land
Wherever I go
Way down here I know
This is your land
Ah this is your land
Take it in your hand
This is your land
Wherever I go
Way down here I know
This is your land
