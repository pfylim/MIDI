SPLIT ENZ - MESSAGE TO MY GIRL

I don't want to say I love you
That would give away too much
It's hip to be detached and precious
The only thing you feel is vicious
I don't want to say I want you
Even though I want you so much
It's wrapped up in conversation
It's whispered in a hush
Though I'm frightened of the word
Think it's time that it was heard

Refrain:
No more empty self possession
Vision swept under the mat
It's no new year's resolution
It's more than that

And now I wake up happy
Warm in a lover's embrace
No one else can touch us
While we're in this place
So I'll sing to the world
This simple message to my girl

Refrain: ...

No there's nothing quite as real
As the touch of your sweet hand
I can't spend the rest of my life
Buried in the sand
