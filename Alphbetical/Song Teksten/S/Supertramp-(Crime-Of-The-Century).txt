Now they're planning the crime of the century
well what will it be,
read all about theit schemes and adventuring,
yes it's well worth the fee,
go roll up and see
how they raped the universe,
How they've gone from bad to worse.

Who are these men of lust green and glory
rip off the masks and let's see.
But that's not right oh no what's the story
but there's you and there's me.
a little bit sad ?
Oh no.

Oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la 
oo  la la la la
