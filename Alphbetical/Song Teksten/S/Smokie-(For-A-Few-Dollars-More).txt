Rich girl she buys her dreams it's a rich world behind the scenes
green eyes they tell it all the more she takes the harder they fall
now she ain't easy and she ain't tough
she's had it good but then she's had it rough
and I guess it don't come to much are
with all she's got she aint got enough so she'll
cry just a little for a few Dollars more
she'll lie just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door
you know she'll die just a little for a few Dollars more
even fly just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door
strange things can happen to you
when you've got so much you've got nothing to do
oh what do you know how do you get there 
when there's nowhere to go

SOLO 1: 

And so you wonder just what she'll do
she's never know love but then she's never know you
and it's too bad those sad green eyes are so full of questions
and so full of lies and she'll cry just a little 
for a few Dollars more
she'll lie just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door
you know she'll cry just a little for a few Dollars more
she'll lie just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door

SOLO 2 :

you know she'll cry just a little for a few Dollars more
she'll lie just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door
you know she'll cry just a little for a few Dollars more
even fly just a little like she's done it before
she'll take it she'll fake it for a few Dollars more
she'll show you her heart then she'll show you the door
for a few Dollars more
