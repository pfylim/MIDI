This time we're really breaking up
this time we've said way too much,
this times for all time
how about this time ?

This time there'll be no goodnight kiss
this time is for ever
this time I find that I'm really losing you
my heart is broken now
it really doesn't matter anyhow
now that you've gone away
I only live from day to day.

This time there'll be no goodnight kiss
this time is for ever
this time I find that I'm really losing you
my heart is broken now
it really doesn't matter anyhow
now that you've gone away
I only live from day to day.

This time there'll be no goodnight kiss
this time is for ever
this time I find that I'm really losing you.
