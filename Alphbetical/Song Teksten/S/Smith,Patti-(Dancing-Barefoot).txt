Singer : PATTI SMITH 
Title  : DANCING BAREFOOT

(Words & music: Patty Smith/I. Kral)

She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the rude connection
She is connecting with me

Chorus:
Here I go, well I don't know why
I flow so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taken over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me
Make me come on
Like some heroine

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating
On he the chosen of she

Chorus: ...

She is recreation
She is intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation
That he is levitation with she

Chorus: ...

Oh God, I fell for you
Oh God, I fell for you
Oh God, I fell for you
