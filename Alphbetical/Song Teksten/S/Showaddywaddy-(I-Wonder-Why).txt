Title  : I WONDER WHY

(Words & music: Melvin Anderson/Ricardo Weeks)

I wonder why I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do

I told my friends that we would never part
They laughed and said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part

Bong, bong, bong
Ooooh, ooooh
Bong, bong, bong, bong
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop

When you're with me I'm sure you're always true
When I'm away I wonder what you do
I wonder why I'm sure you're always true, always true
