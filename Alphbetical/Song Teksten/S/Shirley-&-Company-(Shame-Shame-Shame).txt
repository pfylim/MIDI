Title  : SHAME SHAME SHAME

(spoken)
Oh, it feels so good
And I want you to know about it
See I want you to feel it too
So just listen to me baby

(girl)
Can't stop me now
Hear what I say
My feet want to move so
Get out my way
I'm gonna have my say
I'm going to ev'ry discotheque
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance, ooh
Till the break of day, I say

(both)
Shame shame shame, aah
Shame on you, if you can't dance too
I say shame shame shame shame shame shame
Shame shame on you if you can't dance too

(boy)
Don't stop the motion if you get the notion
You can't stop the groove, 'cause you just won't move
Got my sunroof down, got my diamond in the back
Put on your shaky wig woman
If you don't I ain't comin' back
I say shame shame shame aah
Shame on you, if you can't dance too
I say shame shame shame shame shame shame
Shame shame on you if you can't dance too

If you don't want to go
Remember one monkey don't stop no show
Body needs action
Ain't gonna blow
Yes I'm going out and find a dancin' man
If you really think you're fast try to catch me
If you can
I say shame shame shame aah
Shame on you, if you can't dance too
I say shame shame shame shame shame shame
Shame shame on you if you can't dance too
