Title  : ON THE BORDER

(Words & music: Al Stewart)

The fishing boats go out
Across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms
Across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
And turns the rifles into silver
On the border

On my wall the colors
Of the maps are running
From Africa the winds
They talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting
On the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change
From day to day
No on e notices the customs slip away

Late last night
The rain was knocking on my window
I moved across the darkened room
And in the lampglow I thought
I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing
On the border

In the island where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air
You feel too will

The fishing boats go out
Across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms
Across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
And turns the rifles into silver
On the border
