Title  : LIES
Artist : STATUS QUO

(Words & music: Francis Rossi/Bernard Frost)

I had another drink
After another drink
And then I tried to crawl to the door
I had another smoke
After another joke
And then I couldn't take anymore
It didn't change a thing
Not any single thing
When someone tried to tell me for sure

I heard another voice that said I wasn't in a dream
I read a word of two about everything
I never knew the way that I ought to have been
They never told me a thing about it
I never did know a thing about it

And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes
They won't go away
And the times that I've tried 
Are the times that I find
They don't show today
But you make me feel so good

I woke up after four
Still lying on the floor
Waiting to be carried away
I woke up once again
A little after ten
Will things be any better today
It doesn't change you see
It only changes me
Will someone try t tell me I'm sure

I'm gonna hear a voice and I know it isn't in a dream
I'm gonna read the lines again and look between
I never knew the way that it ought to have been
They never told me a thing about it
I never did know a thing about it

I'm going back to school
I'm gonna check the rules
Anbd see if I get carried away
I'm going back again
I'm gonna try again
Don't listen what the people might say
It doesn't change a thing
Not any single thing
Will someone try to tell me I'm sure
