Title  : Don't Forget About Me
Singer : Simple Minds


Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone, dancing
You'll know it'll be me
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Giving me everything inside and out
Love's strange so real in the dark
Think of the tender things
That we were working on
Slow change may pull us apart
When the light gets into your heart baby

Chorus:
Don't you forget about me
Don't don't don't don't
Don't you forget about me

Will you stand above me
Look my way, never love me
Rain keeps falling (2x)
Down down down
Will you recognize me
Call my name or walk on by
Rain keeps falling (2x)
Down down down, hey...
oooh...

Don't you try and pretend
It's my beginning we'll win in the end
Or harm you or touch you defenses
Vanity insecurity ooh

Don't you forget about me
I'll be alone, dancing
You know it baby
Going to take you apart
I will put us back together at heart baby

Chorus

As you walk on by
Will you call my name
When you walk away
Oh will you walk away
Will you walk away
Oh call my name
Will you call my name
La la la la la la la, etc.
