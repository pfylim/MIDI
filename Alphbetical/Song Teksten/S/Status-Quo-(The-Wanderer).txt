STATUS QUO - THE WANDERER

Well I'm the type of guy
That would never settle down
Where pretty girls are
Well you know that I'm around
I kiss'em and I love'em
'Cause to me they're all the same
I hug'em and I squeeze'em
They don't even know my name
The call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around around around around

Oh, well now there's Flo on my left
And there's Mary on my right
And Janie is the girl
That I'll be with tonight
And when she asks me
Which one I love the best
I tear open my shirt
And show her Rosie on my chest
'Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around around around around

Well I roam from town to town
I got thru life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron
I'm going nowhere

Refrain:
Well I'm the type of guy
That likes to roam around
I'm never in one place
I go from town to town
And when I find myself
Falling for some girl
Yeah I hop into that car of mine
And drive around the world
'Cause I'm the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around around around around

Well I roam from town to town
I got thru life without a care
And I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron
I'm going nowhere

Refrain: ...

They call me the wanderer
Yeah, the wanderer
I roam around around around around
