Vers 1:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Know, know, know him is to love, love, love him.
Just to see him smile.
Makes my life worth while. To know, know, know him
ist to love, love, love him.
And Ido, and I do, and I do.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Why can't he see how blind he can be ?
Some day he'll see that he was meant for me.
(Oh Oh !)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
So I'd be good to him and I'd bring love to him.
Ev'ryone says there'll come a day when I'll walk along side of him.
Yes, yes, to know him is to love, love, love him.
And I do, and I do, and I do
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Vers 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Why cant he...
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So know, know, know him is to love, love, love him;
And I do, and I do, and I do, and I do , and I do.
