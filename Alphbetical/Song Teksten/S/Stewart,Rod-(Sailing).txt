Singer : ROD STEWART 
Title  : SAILING

I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
I am sailing stormy waters
To be near you to be free
I am flying, I am flying
Like a bird 'cross the sky
I am flying passing high clouds
To be with you to be free

Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away
I am dying forever trying
To be with you who can say
Can you hear me, can you hear me
Through the dark night far away
I am dying forever trying
To be with you who can say

I am sailing, we are sailing
Home again 'cross the sea
We are sailing stormy waters
To be near you to be free

We are free, oh Lord to be near you
To be free, oh Lord to be free
