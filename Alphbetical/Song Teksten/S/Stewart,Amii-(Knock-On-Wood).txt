Title  : KNOCK ON WOOD

(Words & music: Steve Cropper/Eddy Floyd)

I don't wanna lose this good thing that I;ve got
But if I do I wil surely lose the lot
I suppose it's better to give it up, I know
Just like thunder lightning
The way your love is striking
I'd better knock on wood

I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinnin' baby
But baby I'm a tracne
'Cos your love is better than any love I know
Just like thunder lightning
The way your love is striking
I'd better knock on wood baby

I'ts no secret that woman fills my lovin' cup
She sees to it that I get enough
Just one touch from her, you know it do so much

Like thunder lightning
The way your love is striking
I'd better knock on wood
