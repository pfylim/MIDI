Title  : BABE

(Words & music: Dennis de Young)

Babe, I'm leaving I must be on my way
The time is drawing near
My train is going, I see it in your eyes
The love the need your tears
But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing your

Chorus:
'Cause you know it's you babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe that it's true
Babe, I love you

Chorus: ...

Babe, I'm leaving I'll say it once again
And somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while
'Cause I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
But please believe me, my heat is in your hands
'Cause I'll be missing you

Babe I love you
Babe I love you
