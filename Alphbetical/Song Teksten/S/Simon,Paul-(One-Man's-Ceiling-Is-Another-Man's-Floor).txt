Titel:        ONE MAN'S CEILING IS ANOTHER MAN'S FLOOR

There's been some hard feelings here
about some words that were said
there's been some hard feelings here
and what is more
there's been a bloody purple nose
and some bloody purple clothes
that were messing up the lobby floor
it's just apartment house rules
so all you 'partment fools.
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor.
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor.

There's been some strange goin's on
and some folks have come and gone
and the elevator man don't work no more
I heard a racket in the hall
and I thought I heard a fall
but I never opened up my door
it's just apartment house sense
it's like apartment rents.
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor.
Remember: one man's ceiling is another man's floor.

And there's an alley
in the back of my building
where some people congregate in shame
I was walking with my dog
and the night was black with smog
when I thought I heard somebody
call my name.
