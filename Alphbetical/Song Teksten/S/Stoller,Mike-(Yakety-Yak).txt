Take out the papers and the trash,
or you don't get no spending cash.
If you don't scrub that kitchen floor,
You ain't gonna rock 'n' roll no more.

Yakety yak ! Don't talk back.

Just finish cleaning up your room.
Let's see that dust fly with that broom.
Get all that garbage out of sight,
or you don't go out Friday night.

Yakety yak ! Don't talk back.

You just put on your coat and hat.
And walk yourself to the laundry mat. 
And when you finish doing that,
bring in the dog and put out the cat.

Yakety yak ! Don't talk back.

Don't you give me no dirty looks.
Your father's hip, he knows what cooks.
Just tell yourhoodlum friend outside,
You ain't got time to take a ride.

Yakety yak ! Don't talk back.
Yakety yak !
Yakety yak !
