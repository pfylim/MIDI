When a man loves a woman can't keep his mind on nothin' else.
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found.
If she's bad he can't see it, she can do no wrong;
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down.
When a man loves a woman spend his very last dime.
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs.
He'd give up all his comforts,
Sleep out in the rain.
If she says that the way in ought to be.

Well this man loves you woman
I gave you ev'ry thing I had.
Tryin' to hold on your high class love,
Baby please don't treat me mad.

When a man loves a woman
Very deep in his soul.
She can bring him such misery.
If she plays him for a fool
He's the last one to know;
Lovin' eyes can never see.
When a man loves a woman
He could never do her wrong.
He'd never want some other girl.
Yes, when a man loves a woman,
I know how he feels.
'Cause baby, baby, baby you're my world.
