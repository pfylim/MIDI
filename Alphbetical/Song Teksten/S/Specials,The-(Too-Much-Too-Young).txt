Title  : TOO MUCH TOO YOUNG

(Words & music: The Specials)

Chorus:
You've done too much, much too young
Now you're married with a kid
When you could be having fun with me

You've done too much, much too young
Now you're married with a son
When you should be having fun with me

Ain't he cute, no he ain't
He's just another burden on the welfare state

Chorus: ...

Call me immature, call me a poster
I'd love to spread manure in your bed of roses
Don't wanna be rich, don't wanna be famous
But I'd really hate to have the same name as you

Chorus: ...

You've done too much, much too young
Now you're chained to the cooker
Making currant buns for ten

Ain't you heard of starving millions?
Ain't you heard of contraception?
Do you really wanna programme of sterilisation?

State control of the population
No!
It's in your living room
Keep a generation gap
Try wearing a cap
