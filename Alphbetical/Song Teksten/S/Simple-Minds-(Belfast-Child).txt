SIMPLE MINDS - BELFAST CHILD

When my love said to me meet me down by the Gallow Tree
For it's sad news I bring
About this old town and all that it's suffering
Some say troubles ar abound
Some day soon they're going to pull the old town down
One day we'll return here
When the Belfast Child sings again

Brothers, sisters where are you now
As I look for you right through the crowd
For all my life here I have spent
With my faith in God and Church and the Government
Some say troubles are abound
Some day soon they're going to pull the old town down
One day we'll return here
When the Belfast Child sings again
When the Belfast Child sings again

Come back Billy, won't you come on home
Come back Mary, you've been away so long
The streets are empty and your mother's gone
The girls are crying and it's been oh so long
And your Father's calling com on home
Won't you come on home, come on home

Come back people you've been gone a while
And the war is raging through the Emerald Isle
But what's flesh and blood man
That's flesh and blood
The girls are crying but all's not lost
The streets are empty 'cause the streets are cold
Won't you come on home
Won't you come on home
The streets are empty... Life goes on

One day we'll return here
When the Belfast Child sings again
When the Belfast Child sings again
