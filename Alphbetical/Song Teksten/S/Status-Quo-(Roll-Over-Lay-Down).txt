Singer : STATUS QUO 
Title  : ROLL OVER LAY DOWN

When I got home that night early one morning
Seeing the note written in ink pinned to the door
Taking a drink cool from the fridge walk from the table
I drank a toast you were the most the night before

Refrain:
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over it's a long way where I've been
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over lay down

When I get home tomorrow night after this morning
Show me the care you showed in the note the night before
Maybe I won't take a drink from the table
Reckon that I'll lay me straight down on the floor

Refrain: ...
