Title  : ONLY A FOOL

(Words & music: Slinger Franciso)

Why do I keep fooling myself
When I know you love someone else
Only a fool breaks his own heart

I pretend that I don't see
When you walk with him down the street
Only a fool breaks his own heart

Chorus:
I have to admit it
Even though you hurt me so, girl
I can't forget it
If I were a man, I'd let you go
It's no use trying to hang on
To a love already gone
Only a fool breaks his own heart

Chorus: ...2x...
