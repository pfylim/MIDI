8. KISS FROM A ROSE - SEAL

Payaya (papa) parapararara (papa) payaya
Payaya (papa) parapararara (papa) payaya.

There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me
The love remained a drug that's the high enough to appear
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large
And the light that you shine can't be seen.

Baby, I compare to a kiss from a rose on a grave
Ooh, the more I get of you stranger it feels the air
And now that your rose's in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grave.

Payayaparapararara (pa... payaya).

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is unhealthy, babe
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large 
And the light that you shine can't be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave
Ooh, the more I get of you stranger it feels the air
And now that your rose's in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grave.

I've (I've) been (been) kissed by a rose on the grave
I've (I've) been kissed by a rose on the grave
I've (I've) been (and if I should fall) kissed by a rose on the grave
I've (I've) been kissed by a rose on the grave.

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me is unhealthy, baby
But did you know that when it snows
My eyes become large 
And the light that you shine can't be seen.

Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grave
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels the air
 Now that your rose's in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grave
Yes, I compare you to a kiss from a rose...
