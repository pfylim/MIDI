  I believe in woman My Oh My
  I believe in lovin' My Oh My
  Don't woman need a man 
  Try and catch one if you can
  I believe in woman My Oh My

  We all need someone to talk to My Oh My
  We all need someone to talk to My Oh My
  You need a shoulder to cry on
  Call me I'll be standing by
  We all need someone to talk to My Oh My

  We all need a lotta lovin' My Oh My
  Yeh a whole lotta lovin' My Oh My
  I can lend a helping hand
  If you ain't got nothing planned
  We all need some lovin' My Oh My

  So let's all swing together My Oh My
  We can all swing together My Oh My
  You've got troubles of your own
  No need to face them all alone
  We can all swing together My Oh My

  So let's all pull together My Oh My
  Yeh let's all pull together My Oh My
  We can ride the stormy weather
  If we all get out and try
  So let's all pull together My Oh My
  Yeh let's all pull together My Oh My
