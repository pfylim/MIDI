SADE - WHEN AM I GOING TO MAKE A LIVING?

Ooh ahhha ahhha oooh

When am I going to make a living?
Ooh, it's going to take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving, yeah
While the sharks are wheeling and dealing

Gotta wake up and tell yourself
There's no end to what you can do
Can't waste your body and soul
If you allow them to
This is the time to start
Believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

When am I going to make a living?
Ooh, it's going to take a while before I give in
See the people fussing and thieving, yeah
Too many lies no one is achieving

Haven't I told you before
We're hungry for a life we can't afford
There's no end, to what you can do
If you give yourself a chance to prove

We're hungry but we won't give in (7x)

Ooh, there's no end to what you can do
Don't waste your body and soul
If you allow them to
Ooh, start believing in yourself
Put the blame on no one else

When am I going to make a living?
85's going to take a while
Before I give in, yes it is
I'm sick and tired of scratchin' and livin'
I am hungry, but I'm not, going to give in, noo

Hungry but we won't give in (7x)

Hungry, but we're going to win
