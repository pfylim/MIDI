Title  : DON'T SLEEP AWAY THE NIGHT
Artist : DANIEL SAHULEKA

(Words & music: Daniel Sahuleka)

Tomorow's near, never I felt this way
Tomorow, how empty it will be that day
It tastes so bitter
Or are thesse the tears that I hide?
To know that you're my only light
I love you, oh I need you, oh yes, I do

Chorus:
Don't sleep away the night, my baby
Please stay with me, at least till dawn
It hurts to know another hour has gone by
'Cause every minute is worthwhile

How many lonely days are there waiting for me?
How many seasons will flow over me?
Till the emotions make my tears run dry
At the moments I should cry
I love you, oh I need you, oh yes, I do

Chorus: ...
