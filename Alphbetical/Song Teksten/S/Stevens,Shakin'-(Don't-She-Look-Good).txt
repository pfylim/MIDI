I know she looks good when her lips start to shake
you know you're alright babe there ain't no mistake
don't she look fine when she gives you the sign
for you to come over and have yourself a good time.

Well she knows what's on your mind
there aint no use in lyin'
what she wants is natural love,
I can't blame you for tryin'.

Well you know you can't dance when it gets close to three
well if you wanna take her home have yourself a party
well she can tempt you with a smile that'll drive you wild
you know she's all grown up she ain't no young child.

Well she knows what's on your mind
there aint no use in lyin'
what she wants is natural love,
I can't blame you for tryin'.

When she's standing in line you can spot her everytime
that's for sure
and ain't it mighty fine when she says she's all mine.
Not yours.
