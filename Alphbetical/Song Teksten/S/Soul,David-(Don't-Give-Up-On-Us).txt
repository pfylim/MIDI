Title  : DON'T GIVE UP ON US

(Words & music: Tony Macauly)

Don't give up on us baby
Don't make the wrong seem right
The future isn't just one night
It's written in the moonlight
And painted on the stars

Don't give up on us baby
We're still worth one more try
And though we put a last one by
Just for a rainy evening
When maybe stars are few
Don't give up on us
I know we can still come through

Don't give up on us baby
Lord knows we've come this far
Why can't we stay the way we are
The angel and the dreamer
When sometimes plays a fool
Don't give up on us
I know we can still come through

I nearly lost my head last night
You've got a right to stop believing
There's still a little love left even so
Don't give up on us
