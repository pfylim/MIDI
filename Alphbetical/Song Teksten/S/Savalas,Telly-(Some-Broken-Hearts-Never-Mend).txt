Title  : SOME BROKEN HEARTS NEVER MEND
Artist : TELLY SAVALAS

(Words & music: Wayland Holyfield)

Coffee black cigarette
Start this day like all the rest
First thing every morning that I do
Is start missing you

Chorus:
Some broken hearts never mend
some mem'ries never end
Some tears will never dry
My love for you will never die

Rendez-vous in the night
A willing woman to hold me tight
In the middle of love's embrace
I see your face

Chorus: ...2x...
