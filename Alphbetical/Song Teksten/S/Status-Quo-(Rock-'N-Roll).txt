STATUS QUO - ROCK'N'ROLL

Never thought I'd ever worry for me to be alone
Playing hero far too many
Times I should have known

Refrain:
It could loose you while you sleep at night
Twelve hours blues is now alright
Now it's up to you, try and find the reason to
Rock'n'roll in every song
Rock'n'roll in everyone
It's rock'n'roll'n'rock'n'rock'n'roll
It's rock'n'roll'n'rock keep rolling on
Waiting all the time to find
Radio plays ol' Caroline
They say you get there in the end
We can pray
We can pray
What we say
What we say
What we say
Makes a difference in the end

Rushing always in a hurry I try to give it up
Everything we do is funny it's never good enough

Refrain: ...
