Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------------
All around my hat, I will wear the green willow.
And all around my hat, for a twelve month and a day.
And if anyone should ask me, the reason why I'm wearing it,
it's all for my true love who's far far away.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fare thee well cold winter
and fare thee well cold frost,
nothing have I gained but
my own true love I've lost,
I'll sing and I'll be merry
when occasion I do see,
he's false deluding young man,
let him go farewell he.

Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------------
All around...
------------------------------------------------------------

The other night he brought me
a fine diamond ring,
but he thought to have deprived me
of a far better thing,
but I being careful
like lovers ought to be,
he's false deluding young man,
Let him go farewell he.

Refrain:
------------------------------------------------------------
All around...
------------------------------------------------------------

The Quarter pound of reason,
and a half a pound of sense,
a small sprig of time
and as much of prudence,
you mix them all together
and you will plainly see,
he's a false deluding young man,
let him go farewell he.

Refrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------
All around...
-------------------------------------------------------------
