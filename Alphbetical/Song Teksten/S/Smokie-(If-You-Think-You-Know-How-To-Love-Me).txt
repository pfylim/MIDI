Title  : IF YOU THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO LOVE ME

A breathless drive on a down-town street
A motorbike ride in the midday heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run through we'd run, it still burned our eyes
Oh yes, we may walk on the wild wild side of life
And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise you can take my hand
And show me a way to understand

Refrain:
So if you think you know how to love me
And you think you know what I need
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way
Yes if you think you know how to love me
And you think you can stand by me
And if you really really want me to stay
You've got to lead the way

A reckless night in a nameless town
Then we moved out of sight with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept knowing we'd be safe
Now you may think you can walk on the wild wild side with me
But there's a lot I can learn
And a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands
It's up to you to make me understand

Refrain: ...
