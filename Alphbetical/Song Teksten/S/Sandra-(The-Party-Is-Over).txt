Title  : THE PARTY'S OVER

The lights are low
That party's going on
And he who's mine, 
He doesn't seem to miss me
I feel alone
I think that I'll go home
But if I stay
At least I hear him

The party's over now
The party's over now
At least I dream it's over now
He's sitting next to me
And we do both agree our life ain't bad at all
Yes, the party's over now
One of those bad dreams suddenly
Came over me
But now I feel at ease

The lights go out
The party's going on
And he who's mine
Seems really to enjoy it
I hear him whisper sweet words
But not to me
I wonder am I really dreaming

The party's over now
The party's over now
At least I dream it's over now
He's sitting next to me
And we do both agree our life ain't bad at all
Yes, the party's over now
One of those bad dreams suddenly
Came over me
But now I feel at ease
