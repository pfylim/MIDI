12. SHUT UP (AND SLEEP WITH ME) - SIN WITH SEBASTIAN

Shut up, and sleep with me c'mon why don't you sleep with me
Shut up, and sleep with me aha, why don't you sleep with me (Ad Lib.)

I like your body not so much I like your mind
Infact you're boring, pretendin' of being of my kind
You keep on talkin' of some girls that I don't know
When will you shut up or where will we go?

Here I am, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?
Here I am, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?

Chorus: Shut up, and slep with me, c'mon....

Don't you listen to those old contemptions
not hide to suppress your real intentions
you're open-minded, and listen what they keep on sayin'
Don't be afraid of doin' what you're best at.
Shut up, shut up, shut up shut up

Here I am, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?
Here I am, you're free
Why don't you sleep with me?

Chorus: Shut up, and slep with me, c'mon....
