13. When Do I Get To Sing "My Way" - The Sparks

No, no use in lecturing them or in threatening them, they will just say who you are
Is that a question or not and you see that the plot is predictable not new
But you're still stunned at the things you will do

No, no use in taking their time or in wasting two times on a call to god knows who
When all you feel is the rain and it's hard to be vain when no person looks at you
So just be gracious and wait in the queue

So when do I get to sing my way		So when do I get to sing my way
When do I get to feel like Sinatra felt		when do I get to feel like Sid Vicious felt
When do I get to sing it my way		when do I get to sing my way
In heaven or hell		in heaven or hell

Yes, it's a tradition they say like a bright Christmas day and traditions must go on
And though I say "yes I see" no I really don't see, is my smileyface still on
Sign your name with an x, mow the lawn

So when I sing my way...
They'll introduce me "hello, hello" woman seduce me and champagne flows
Then the lights go low there's only one song I know
There this home which once was serene, now is home to the scream and to flying plates and shoes
But I have no souvenirs of these crackerjack years, not a moment I could choose
And noone offer that I could refuse

So when do I get to sing my way...
