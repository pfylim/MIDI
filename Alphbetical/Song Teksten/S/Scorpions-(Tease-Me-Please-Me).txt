I've been around the world
I've known a lot  of girls
livin' and lovin'
it's hard to keep them all in line
I've seen a lot of sights
so many crazy nights
crusin' and boozin'
it's awonder that I'm still alive.

Never wasted any time
never missed a beat
total satisfaction
always guaranteed.
Tease me
please me
no one needs to know
tease me
please me
before I have to go.

Spread the word around
the boys are back in town
reelin' and rockin'
we're rollin' with it win or lose
the girls are dressed to kill
just lookin' for a thrill
slidin' and glidin'
sometimes they make it hard to choose.

I never wasted any time
never missed a beat
total satisfaction
always guaranteed.
Tease me
please me
no one needs to know
tease me
please me
before I have to go.
Tease me
please me
we'll take it nice and slow
tease me
please me
just let the feeling grow.
