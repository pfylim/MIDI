THE S O S BAND - BORROWED LOVE

What could make me think that I could
Live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never live on
Borrowed love

It's three-o-one in the morning
Another sleepless night
I feel your presence with me
And it doesn't feel right
And it starts flowing thru me from my
feet right to my hand
Then I scream calling out your name
I want you back in my bed, my bed

What could make me think that I could
Live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never live on
Borrowed love

Like a drummer always beating the
inside of my soul
Hidden feeling always seeking the
touch they knew so well
In the place that matter

What could make me think that I could
Live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never live on
Borrowed love

I can't eat, I can't sleep
Think 'bout who you're with
Are you happy making me crazy
You were the best I ever had

What could make me think that I could
Live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never live on
Borrowed love

Love the pain of too much pleasure is
All so clear to me after you go
Nothing but ache to fill my emptiness
emptiness, emptiness

What could make me think that I could
Live on borrowed love
Now I see that I could never live on
Borrowed love
