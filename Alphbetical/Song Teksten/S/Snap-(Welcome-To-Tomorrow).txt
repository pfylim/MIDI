12. WELCOME TO TOMORROW - SNAP

Welcome into my house
Come alone and follow me
To a place you've never been
A mystic fantasy
Take a ride and go with me
In a time and space
I'll show you things
That you never knew
Existed in another place

Chorus:
Ah I wanna know
Ah I wanna know
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow

Welcome into my house
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome into my life

Welcome into my house
Come alone and follow me
To a place you've never been
A mystic fantasy
Take a ride and go with me
In a time and space
I'll show you things
That you never knew
Existed in another place

Hocuspocus turn around
Ain't no magic on the ground
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
Welcome to tomorrow
