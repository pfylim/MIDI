Singer : THE SHIRTS
Title  : LAUGH AND WALK AWAY

(Words & music: Lamonica/Racioppo)

I haven't found the formula 
To measure my distress
The tick tock of my heart clock
Tells my mind I'm so depressed

I searched behind the mirrors and
I broke down all the walls
Is it something rare and new 
Or is it something old?

My job, it takes me everywhere
But I ain't seen a thing
At eight miles an hour
Rolling hills all seem the same

I've searched the mountains and the streams
But I can't find a clue
Is it something old and worn
Or is it something new?

Chorus:
I go where I go
I go where I go
I don't know
Such a silent world and an empty road
Behind that world is a pot of gold

I woke up from a deep, deep sleep
And out the door I went
I didn't bother to turn back
My feet were sore and red
I searched behind the mirrors and 
I broke down all the walls

Is it something revenue or is it something new?
I go where I go
I go where I go
I don't know
It's such a silent world and an empty road

Chorus: ...

I'm sick of greedy people
Who just want a piece of me
They're all so clever and so bright
And modern to the T.

You smell them from a mile away
But I don't really care

When it comes down to the facts
I laugh and walk away (7x)
