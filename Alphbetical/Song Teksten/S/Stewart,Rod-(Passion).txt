Title  : PASSION
Artist : ROD STEWART

(Words & music: Rod Stewart/Chen/Grainger/Savigar/Cregan)

Somebody somewhere
In the heat of the night
Looking pretty dangerous
Running out a patience

Tonight in hte city
You won't fid any pity
Hearts are begin twisted
Another love cheated

In the bars and cafes, passion
In the streets and alleys, passion
A lot of pretending, passion
Everybody's searching for passion

Chorus:
Once in love you're never outta danger
One hot night spent with a stranger
All you wanted was somebody to hold on to
Passion (4x)

New York, Moscow, passion
Hong Kong, Tokyo, passion
Paris and Bangkok, passion
A lotta people ain't got passion

Chorus: ...(2x)...

Hear it on the radio, passion
Read in the paper, passion
Hear in the churches, passion
See it in the schoolyards, passion

Alone in your bed atnight
It's half pas midnight, passion
As you turn out your sidelight, passion
Something ain't right, passion

There's no passion
There's no passion
There's no passion
I need passion
You need, passion
We need, passion
Can't live without, passion
Can't live without, passion
Can't live without, passion
Even the president needs passion
Everybody I know needs some passion
Some people die and kill for passion
Nobody admits they need passion
Some people are scared of passion
