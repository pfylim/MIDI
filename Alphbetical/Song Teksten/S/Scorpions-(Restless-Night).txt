Blackout in London
just slip'n slide
Blackout in London
I'm just about to lose my mind
big time in Paris
time's gonna fly
big time in Paris
it's c'est la vie for me tonight.

Here I go
to take the one and only road I know
in my life
here I go
another place to bare my heart and soul
restless night.

Hot shot in Dallas
a wild horse to ride
hot shot in Dallas
I don't know how but I survived
Rock hard in Rio
pure sex and crime
it's just too much to take tonight.

Here I go
to take the one and only road I know
in my life
here I go
another place to bare my heart and soul
restless night.

Red hot in Moscow
turn back the tide
red hot in Moscow
the eagle rocks the bear tonight
die hard in Tokyo
Lexington nights
die hard in Tokyo
I baraly made it out alive.

Here I go
to take the one and only road I know
in my life
here I go
another place to bare my heart and soul
restless night.
