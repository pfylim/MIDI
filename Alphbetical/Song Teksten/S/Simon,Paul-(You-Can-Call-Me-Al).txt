PAUL SIMON - YOU CAN CALL ME AL

(Words & music: Paul Simon)

A man walks down the street
He says why am I soft in the middle now
Why am I soft in the middle
The rest of my life is so hard
I need a photo opportunity
I want a shot of redemption
Don't want to end up a cartoon
In a cartoon graveyard
Bonedigger, bonedigger
Dogs in the moonlight
Far away my well lit door
Mr Beerbelly, Beerbelly
Get these muts away from me
You know I don't find this stuff
Amusing any more

Refrain:
If you'll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me 
You can call me Al

A man walks down the street
He says why am I short of attention
Got a short little span of attention
And wo my nights are so long
Where's my wife and family
What if I die here
Who'll be my role model
Now what my role model is gone gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some roly poly little bat-faced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

Refrain: ...

Call me Al

A man walks down the street
It's a street in a strange world
Maybe it's the third world
Maybe it's his first time around
He doesn't speak the language
He hold no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound the sound
Cattle in the market place
Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen and Hallelujah

Refrain: ...

Call me na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na na na

If you'll be my bodyguard
I can call you Betty
