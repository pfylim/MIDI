Title  : MY FRIEND STAN

My friend Stan's got a funny old man
Oh yeh oh yeh!
He makes him work all night till he can't do it right
Oh yeh, ah ah!
And from the way you blacked my eye
I know that you're the reason why
And from the way you fixed his tie
I see you're getting to him, gettin' to him

My friend Jack's got an ache in his back
Oo oo, oh yeh!
The doc said he'd be fine if he'd just take his time
Oh oh, mm mm
And from the way you blacked my eye
I know that you're the reason why
And from the way you fixed his tie
I see you're getting to him, gettin' to him

My friend Pete says his body is weak
Oh yeah ah ah!
He told me he can't sleep and his temp'ratures steep
Oh yeh oh yeh!
And from the way you blacked my eye
I know that you're the reason why
And from the way you fixed his tie
I see you're getting to him, gettin' to him
