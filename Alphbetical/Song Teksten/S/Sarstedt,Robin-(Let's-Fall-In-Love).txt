Title  : LET'S FALL IN LOVE

(Words & music: Ted Koehler/Harold Arlen)

I have a feeling
It's a feeling I'm concealing, I don't know why
It's just a mental
Incidental sentimental alibi
But I adore you
So strong for you 
Why go on stalling
I am falling, love is calling, why be shy

Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance, why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes, and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try to make a go of it

We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it while we are young
Let's fall in love

Love fails you never
His endeavour is for ever, fate to defy
Comes to you stealing
With his feeling and appealing lullaby
He made me care for
You dear, therefor
While he delighting
That he's plighting and uniting you and I

Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it
Let's take a chance, why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes, and make our own paradise
Little we know of it, still we can try to make a go of it

We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love, why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it while we are young
Let's fall in love
