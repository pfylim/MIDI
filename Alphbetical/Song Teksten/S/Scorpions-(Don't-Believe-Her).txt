Out for a thrill
got time to kill
just livin' up my dreams
for heaven's sake
she's on the make
a twisted vicar's queen
and then one night we took a ride
she was all over me
outrageous
just ain't real
I was too wasted to see.

Before you get in too deep
and you get burned by the heat
oh yeah
she'll take you there
you know it happened to me.
She'll make you heart break
she'll give you fever
she'll tell you everything but don't believe her
a perfect stranger
she knows the game
she'll promise heaven on earth
but don't believe her.

Out on the streets of broken dreams
where no one ever wins
just when you thought you'd made a start
you're back where you begin.

Before you get in too deep
and you get burned by the heat
oh yeah
she'll take you there
I think you know what I mean.
She'll make you crazy
she's such a teaser
say you're the only one but don't believe her
she deals in danger
the girl's insane
she'll promise heaven on earth
but don't believe her.
