(Words & music: Don Everly/Phil Everly)

Chorus:
Don't want your love anymore
Don't want your kisses that's for sure
I die each time I hear this sound
Here he comes, Cathy's clown

I got to stay in tall
You know a man can't crawl
For when you now she's telling lies
And let some passing by
He's not a man at all

And when you see me shed a tear
And you know it is sincere
Don't you think it's kinda sad
That you treated me so fine
Now don't you even care

Chorus: ...

I got to stay in tall
And when you see me shed a tear
You know a man can't crawl
When you know it is sincere
For when you kow she's telling lies
And let some passing by
Is not a man at all
Oh don't you even care

Chorus: ...

Here he comes: Cathy's clown
Here he comes: Cathy's clown
Here he comes: Cathy's clown
Here he comes: Cathy's clown
