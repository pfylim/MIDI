SIMPLE MINDS - GHOSTDANCING

(Words & music: Ken/Burchill/MacNeil)

Cities buildings falling down
Satellites come crashing down
Oh I see them falling out the skies like eagles
Mirrored glass and shattered egos
But in the corner of the world
We meet to laugh and drink and plan our sequels
'Cause in the alleyways and bars down town
Shining up from here to there can we go ah
The city comes to life at night
See the city walls are heaving
Ooh if these old city walls should crash
Amid the rubble find us breathing

Come see what you see in me
'Cause boy I believe in you
Come see what you're seeing
All gone just ghostdancing
Going all the way through

You talk about the Lebanon
You tell me 'bout the dawn in Eden
Ooh you talk about South Africa
I tell you about the Irish children
You say one more Polish knight
Could come and blow away the doors to freedom
And mother Ethiopia could blow away the tears we see run
Oh blow them away, blow blow away
We will blow them away oh blow blow away
Blow blow away blow blow away

Come see what you see in me
'Cause boy I believe in you
Come see what you're seeing
They've all gone just ghostdancing
Going all the way through
Going all the way through
Going all the way through

You know I believe in you
Oh yes I believe
You know I believe in you
You said you believe oh yeah
I believe going all the way through yeah
Going all the way through
Going all the way through
Come and take me back home
Come on and take me away away away
Ghostdancing

Oh the car pulled up the girl she jumped in
The boy he wore a medal that was shining from his skin
Windows pulled up the radio's tuning in
She's hitting for the stars she's hitting for the moon

She said one last kiss while you look across the land
Move me into overdrive and take me by my hand
The car went broke the rebels saw smoke
And they all went to heaven in a stupid fantasy
Go take me away

Oh away
Come on and take me away
