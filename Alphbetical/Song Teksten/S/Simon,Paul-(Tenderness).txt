Titel:        TENDERNESS

Interpret:    PAUL SIMON

What can I do
what can I do
much of what you say is true
I know you see through me
but there's no tenderness
beneath your honesty.

Right and wrong
right and wrong
never helped us get along
you say you care for me
but there's no tenderness
beneath your honesty.

You and me were such good friends
what's your hurry ?
You and me could make amends
I'm not worried
I'm not worried.

Honesty
honesty
it's such a waste of energy
no you don't have to lie to me
just give me some tenderness
beneath your honesty
you don't have to lie to me
just give me some tenderness.
