                           I DREAMED A DREAM 

 I dreamed a dream in time gone by
 When hope was high and life worth living
 I dreamed that love would never die
 I dreamed that God would be forgiving

 Then I was young and unafraid
 When dreams were made and used and wasted
 There was no ransom to be paid
 No song unsung,no wine untasted

 But the tigers come at night
 With their voices soft as thunder
 As they tear your hope apart
 As they turn your dream to shame..................

 He slept a summer by my side
 He filled my days with endless wonder
 He took my childhood in his stride
 But he was gone when autumn came

 And still I dreamed he'd come to me
 That we would live the years together
 But there are dreams that cannot be
 And there are storms we cannot weather

 ................
 I had a dream my life would be
 ...............
 So different from this hell I'm living,so different now from what it seemed
 Now life has killed the dream...I dreamed
