     Saragossa Medley III  


Sunday morning up at the log
I think I take a walk in the park
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful day
I've got someone waiting for me
And then I see her , I know that she'll sing
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful day

Ha ha ha it's a beautiful sunday
This is my my my beautiful day
When you say say say that you love me
Oh oh oh my my my it's a beautiful day

Cecilia you're breaking my heart
You're shaking my confidence daily
Oh Cecilia I'm down on my knees
I'm beggin' you please to come home , come on home
(2 Mal )

A sun grows up a car goes by
It's nearly 1 a.m. and here am I
Hitchin' a ride , hitchin' a ride
Gotta get me home , by the morning light

I got no fare to ride a train
I'm nearly drownin' in the pourin' rain
Hitchin' a ride , hitchin' a ride
Gotta get my home to baby's side
ride ride ride hitchin' a ride
ride ride ride hitchin' a ride

Ha ha said the clown
As the King lost his crown
With the mighty Queen tired and romanced
Ha ha said the clown
Is it bringing you down
That you blust your jams

Come on without come on within
you not see nothing like a mighty Queen 
( 2 Mal )

Sunrise this is the last that I ever seen
Out in the quarter they ready for me
But I go to my love with no fear
Cause I did what I did for Maria

As I rolled into town with the sun going down
All the windows were borked there was noone around
For the new day I've come with my head and my gun
And be wagin' my part for Marie my fear is a part of Maria

Take a night for a night and a life for a life
And somebody must die for the dead of my wife
Yes I did what I did for Maria
I did what I did for Maria
