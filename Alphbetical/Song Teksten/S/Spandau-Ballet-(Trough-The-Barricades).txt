Mother doesn't know where love has gone
She says it must be youth
That keep us feeling strong
I see it in her face that's turned to ice
And when she smiles she shows
The line of sacrifice
And now I know what they're saying
As our sun begins to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
And through the barricades
Father made my history
He fought for what he thought
Would set us somehow free
They taught me what to say in school
I learned it off by heart
But now that's torn in two
And now I know what they're saying
In the music of parade
And we made our love on wasteland
And throught the barricades
Born on different sides of life
But we fear the same
And feel all of this strife
So come to me when I'm asleep
And we'll cross the lines
And dance upon the streets
And now I know what they're saying
As the drumps beginn to fade
And we made our love on wasteland
Ant through the barricades
Oh turn around and I'll be there
Well there's scar right through my heart
But I'll bare it again
Oh I thought we were the human race
But we were just another border-line case
And the stars reach down and tell us 
That there's always one escape
Oh I don't know where love has gone
And in this troubled land
Desperation keeps us strong
Friday's child is full of soul
With nothing left to lose
There's everything to go
And now I know what they're saying
It's terrible beauty we've made
So we make our love on wasteland
And through the barricades
And now I know what they're saying
As our hearts go to the graves
And we made our love on wasteland
Oh and through the barricades
