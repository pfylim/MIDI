SIMPLE MINDS - SANCTIFY YOURSELF

Is this the age of the thunder and rage
Can you feel the ground move 'round your feet
If you take one step closer, it'll lead to another
The crossroad above is where we meet
I shout out for shelter
I need you for something
The whole world is out, they're all on the street
Control yourself - love is all you need
Control yourself - in your eyes
Sanctify yourself, sanctify
Be a part of me, sanctify sanctify yourself
Sanctify, sanctify yourself, set yourself free

In pictures of living in bloodshot a vision
Sweet miracles and strange circumstances
I see the sun up, the showdown
The cool winds that blow down
On the big beat that life long romance is
You've got a gun in your hand
You're making self plans
Stay with me all through the night
Control yourself - love is all you need
Control yourself - open up your heart
Sanctify yourself

So you can't stop the world for a boy or a girl
Sweet victims of poor circumstances
But you can pour back the love
Sweeping down from above
Giving hope and making more chances

Well I hope and pray
That - maybe someday
You'll come back down here
And show me the way

Control yourself - love is all you need
Control yourself - open up your heart
Sanctify yourself
