Title  : BEAT THE CLOCK

(Words & music: Ron Meal/Russel Meal)

Well, I was born a little premature
Mom she just couldn't take no more
Had no time to learn to cry
Goodbye Mama, got to fly
Bye bye bye bye bye bye

Entered school when I was two
P.H.D.'d that afternoon
Never entered any sports
Didn't look too good in shorts
Got divorced when I was four

Chorus:
Well, I've seen ev'rything there is
I've done ev'rything there is
I've met ev'ryone but Liz
Now I've even met old Liz
No time for relationship
Skip the foreplay, let 'er rip
You gotta beat the clock (4x)

I did lots of traveling
Parts of me unraveling
The army then rejected me
Said I had two flat feet
Wore them out when I was three
Too bad there ain't then of you
Then I'd show you what to do
I could cheat on five of you
And be faithful to you too
But there's only one of you

Chorus: ...
