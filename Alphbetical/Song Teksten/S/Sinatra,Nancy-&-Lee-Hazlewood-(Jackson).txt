JACKSON - NANCY SINATRA & LEE HAZLEWOOD


We got married in a fever.
Hotter than a peppers sprout.
We‹ve been talking ‹bout Jackson.
Ever since the fire went out.
I‹m goin‹ to Jackson.
I‹m gonna mess around. Yeah.
I‹m goin‹ to Jackson.
Look out Jackson town.

Well, go on down to Jackson.
Go ahead and wreck your health.
Go play your hen you big talkin‹ man
Make a big fool of yourself, yeah, yeah,
Go to Jackson but go comb that hair.
I‹m gonna snowball Jackson.
Go ahead and see if I care.

When I breeze into that city.
All people gonna stoop and bow.
All them women gonna make me
Teach them what they don‹t know how.
I‹m goin‹ to Jackson.    
You‹re turn and loosen my coat.
‹Cause I‹m goin‹ to Jackson.
Goodbye, that‹s all she wrote.

They‹ll laugh at you in Jackson.
I doubt it- and I'll be dancing on a pony treck.
They‹ll lead you ‹round that town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs, yeah, yeah, yeah
Go to Jackson you big talkin‹ man.
And I‹ll be waitin‹ there in Jackson.
Behind my J penned plan.

We got married in a fever.
Hotter than a peppers sprout.
We‹ve been talking ‹bout Jackson.
Ever since the fire went out.
Goin‹ to Jackson.
And that‹s a natural fact.
We‹re goin‹ to Jackson.
Ain‹t never commin‹ back.

Repeat and fade out
