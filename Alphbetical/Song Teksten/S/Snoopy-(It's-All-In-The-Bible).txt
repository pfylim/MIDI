Title  : IT'S ALL IN THE BIBLE

(Words & music: J. Eggermont/Britnell/A. Treffers)

Ooh, aah, ooh, aah
Who made this world for us to play?
It's all in the bible
And who makes the sun come up every day?
It's all in the bible

The truth is there in black and white
It says: don't lie
It says: don't fight
Can't we see what's wrong or right?
Prophets wrote it all down
In the bible

It's all in the bible
It's all in the bible
It's all in the bible
Ooh, aah
The Garden of Eden must have been so fine
It's all in the bible
A land of honey, milk and wine
It's all in the bible

In paradise Eve was a queen
But snake in the grass
He looked real mean
Something Adam should have seen
Prophets wrote it all down
In the bible

It's all in the bible
It's all in the bible
It's all in the bible
Ooh, aah
It's all in the bible (9x)
