JOYCE SIMS - COME INTO MY LIFE

refrain:
Come into my life, I've got so much love to show you
Come into my life boy, I adore you
Come into my life, I've got so much love to show you
Come into my life boy, I adore you

Come into my life I'll open the door if you
Come into my life boy I adore you
And I will treat you right and I'll show you
Sweet mellow days that you want and need

For you hold the key to my life
Good times will flow if you
Make our love strong and tight together as one not two
We'll shine like diamond ice and I'll show you sweet mellow days
That you want and need

Because I can brighten up your days
And when you're feeling bad I'll put a smile on your face
Can you tell me what price must I pay
To make you see things my way
