Everyone starts one way or the other
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact
I don't let nothing hold you back
If the scatman can do it
So can you
Everybody's saying that the scatman stuns
But it never does a scat with a sense
But what you don't know
I'm gonna tell you right now
That the stunner and the scat
Is the same thing
You are the scatman
Where's the scatman?
I'm the scatman

Watching with the reason
And the politician reasons
Would try to change the seasons
If they could
The stay of the conditions
Solves my intuition
And it only makes me crazy
And a heart like wood
Everybody starts one way or another
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact
Don't let nothing hold you back
If a scatman can do it brother
So can you
I'm a scatman

Everybody starts one way or another
So check out my message to you
As a matter of fact
I don't let nothing hold you back
If the scatman can do it
So can you
I hear you all asking about the meaning of scat
Well I'm the professor
And all I can tell you
Is while you're still sleeping
The saints are still weeping
'Cause things you call dead
Haven't yet had a chance to be born
I'm the scatman.
