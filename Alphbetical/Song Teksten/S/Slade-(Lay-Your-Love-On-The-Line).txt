  Singer  : SLADE 
  Title   : Lay Your Love on The Line
  Written : By Dave Hill/Bill Hunt

  I hear the sound of rock'n'roll thunder
  I think you know the spell that I'm under
  I feel that something's playin' crazy with my heart
  Up in the sky the heavens are fallin'
  And all around the angels are callin'
  You're movin' mountains slowly and tearin' me apart

  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Say you're gonna ne mine

  If I could be a man for all seasons
  Give me your answer, give me your reasons
  I'd like to be a king, if only for a day
  I've seen the world and i know what I'm after
  One look from you and my heart's a disaster
  And every dream I've dreamed, would take your breath away

  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Say you're gonna be mine

  Solo Dave

  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Lay your love on the line
  Say you're gonna be mine
