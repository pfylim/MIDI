You know that it would be untrue
you know that I would be a liar
if I was to say to you
baby we couldn't get much higher.

Come on baby light my fire.
Come on baby light my fire.
Try to set the night on fire.

The time for hesitation is through
no time to wallow in the mire
try now we can only lose
and our love become a funeral pyre.

Come on baby light my fire.
Come on baby light my fire.
Try to set the night on fire.

You know that it would be untrue

Come on baby light my fire.
Come on baby light my fire.
Try to set the night on fire.

The time for hesitation is through
no time to wallow in the mire

and our love become a funeral pyre.

Come on baby light my fire.

Come on baby light my fire.
Come on baby light my fire.
