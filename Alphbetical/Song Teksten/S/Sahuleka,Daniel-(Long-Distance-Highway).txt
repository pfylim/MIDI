Title  : LONG DISTANCE HIGHWAY

(Words & music: Daniel Sahuleka)

Two hundred miles to go
With the sun so low
The night is drawing near
When I'm still far from you

The same old engine sounds
Make me lonelier
The many lights that pass me by
Are shining in my eyes

Chorus:
Long distance highway
It seems I'll never get there
Long distance highway
How many lines I've passed by
Long distance highway
Got no one to talk to
Still a hundred miles to go
To be with you

It seems there's no end
I'm tired, I'm so all alone
How many lines do I have to leave behind
Put on my radio
Impatience just ain't cool
Because the minutes goes to slow
And the hours too

Chorus: ...
