Title  : MARIAN COME BACK HOME

It was about ten, when I turned the radio on
I heard the newsman say
There was an accident on the road
The road my babe's driving on

Many wounded, many dead were found
Many cars all in the fire burned to the ground

She could be there lying
She could lay there dying

So I grabbed the phone and called the police
are there any names, please give me release

Marian come back home
You know I can't miss you
I'm all alone
Marian come back home
I hope you're alright
Please come home

The sergeant said I'm sorry
I can not help you yet
The most we can't identify
They're looking very bad
It's really very sad

Many wounded, many dead were found
Many cars all in the fire burned to the ground

She could be there lying
She could lay there dying

So I threw down the phone
'Cause I knew the police
Couldn't give no names
So I prayed on my knees

Marian come back home
You know I can't miss you
I'm all alone
Marian come back home
I hope you're alright
Please come home
