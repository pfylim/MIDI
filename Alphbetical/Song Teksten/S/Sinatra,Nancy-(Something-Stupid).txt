      Something Stupid      
                                                                                         
            
I know I stand the line until you think you have the time,
To spend a evening with me.          
And if we go some place to dance I know that there's a  chance,
You wan't belive it with me.        

And after it's we drop into a quiet little place,
And have a drink or two,
And then I go and start it on by saying something stupid,
Saying something stupid like I love you.

I can see it in your eyes that your disquise,
The same of lise you've heard the night before.
And now it's just a line to you from me it's true,
I've never see so right before.

A practice every day to find some deverlines,
To say to make the meaning come true,
But than I think I wait until the evening,
It's later then alone with you.

The time is right to perfum fills my head the stars,
With rhythm all the night so blue.
And then I go and start it on by saying something stupid,
Saying something stupid like I love you.
