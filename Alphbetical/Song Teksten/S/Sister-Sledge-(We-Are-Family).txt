Singer : SISTER SLEDGE 
Title  : WE ARE FAMILY

(Words & music: Nile Rodgers/Bernard Edwards)

Chorus:
We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Ev'ry one can see we're together as we walk on by
And we flock just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie
All the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a fam'ly dose

Chorus: ...

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
High hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight
No, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong
This is our fam'ly jewel

Chorus: ...
