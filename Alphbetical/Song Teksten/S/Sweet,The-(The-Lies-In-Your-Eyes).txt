Singer : SWEET 
Title  : THE LIES IN YOUR EYES

Ain't nobody gonna take my place 'cause
Ships and chains don't leave no trace
Solid gold brass got a plastic face
Ah

Break me, up every time you try to
Cool me off with a wink in your eye and
I don't eat from a tree in the sky no more

I can see you ain't fooling me
I ain't blind, the lies in your eyes don't disguise
The tears that you cry
I'm not blind the lies in your eyes don't disguise
But the lies  in your eyes

Big fat mouth, watch what you say 'cause
Sooner, later, you're gonna pay
Gone tomorrow here today
Ah

There ain't nobody gonna take my place
Sticks and stones don't leave no trace
I don't need your second face

I can see you ain't fooling me
I ain't blind, the lies in your eyes don't disguise
The tears that you cry
I'm not blind the lies in your eyes don't disguise
But the lies  in your eyes
