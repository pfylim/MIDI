Singer : SHEILA & THE BLACK DEVOTION 
Title  : SINGIN' IN THE RAIN

(Words & music: N.H. Brown/A. Freed)

I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain
What a glorious feeling
I'm happy again
I'm laughing at clouds
So dark up above
The sun's in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Let the stormy clouds chase
Ev'ry one from the place
Come on with the rain
I've a smile on my face
I'll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
And singin' just singin' in the rain
