Title  : SING FOR THE DAY

(Words & music: T. Shaw)

Hannah, you're with me in spirit
Wherever I go
To the ends of the earth
And all points between high and low
Each night by the stage you appear as you are
The ever intangible child
Ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey

Oh Hannah, I know that it's you
And you're leading me on
Hannah, you're my inspiration
My foundation of youth
And as your surrogate leader
I'm bound in your search for the truth

And yes, how the truth rushes out
When it's become honesty clear
I see your anxious and curious eyes
But Hannah, I need you as much as
You think you need me
Come to your window tonight
And we'll fly to your dreams
And we'll

Chorus:
Sing for the day, sing for the moment
Sing for the time of your life
Come for an hour, stay for a moment
Stay for the rest of your life

Hannah, don't fail me I need you
Like never before
Father time's at my back 
On my heels behind every door (and he says)
Son, when the youth has but gone from your face
Will she let you grow older with grace
Will she give you up for one younger than you
Oh Hannah, please tell me the things that he says are untrue
Hannah, I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there

Chorus: ...
