Interpret:       SIMON AND GARFUNKEL


1:
Are you going to Scarborough Fair.
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
Remember me to one who lived there
she once was a true love of mine.

2:
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt.
Parsley, sage, roesmary and thyme.
Without no seam or needlework
then she'll be a true love of mine.

3:
Tell her to find me an acre of land.
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
Between us coldwater and sandsill strands
then she'll be a true love of mine.
