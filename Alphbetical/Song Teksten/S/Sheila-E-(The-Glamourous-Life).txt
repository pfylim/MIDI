SHEILA E - THE GLAMOROUS LIFE

She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got big thoughts, big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes Sedan
What I think this girl
She really wants to be in love with a man

Refrain:
She wants to lead the glamorous life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the glamorous life
Without love it ain't much

Refrain: ...

She saw him standing in the section marked
If you have to ask you can't afford it lingerie
She threw him bread and said make me scream
In the dark what could he say
Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said I need a man's man, baby
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my hate

Refrain: ...
