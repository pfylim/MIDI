Singer : SUPERTRAMP 
Title  : BREAKFAST IN AMERICA

(Words & music: R. Davis)

Chorus:
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot
Take a jumbo 'cross the water
Like to see America
See the girls in California
I'm hoping it's going to come true
But there's not a lot I can do

Could we have kippers for breakfast
Mummy dear, mummy dear?
They got to have 'em in Texas
'Cause ev'ryone's a millionaire
I'm a winner, I'm a sinner
Do you want my autograph?
I'm a loser, what a joker
I'm playing my jokes up on you
While there's nothing better to do

Ba-ba-ba-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow-ba-ba-dow-di-dow-di-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow-ba-ba-dow-di-dow-di-dow
Na na na, na na na na na na

Chorus: ...

Ba-ba-ba-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow-ba-ba-dow-di-dow-di-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow
Ba-ba-ba-dow-ba-ba-dow-di-dow-di-dow
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh
Hey oh, hey oh, hey oh, hey oh
Na na na, na na na na na na
