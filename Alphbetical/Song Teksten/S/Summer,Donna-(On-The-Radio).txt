Title  : ON THE RADIO

(Words & music: Giorgio Moroder/Donna Summer)

Someone found a letter you wrote to me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name, but I knew just who they meant

Wo, I was so surprised and shocked and I wondered too
If by chance you heard it for yourself?
I never told a soul just how I've been feelin' over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air, on the

Chorus:
Radio, wo, on the radio
Wo, on the radio, wo, on the radio, wo

Now, don't think of strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear, is that you love me still
He fin'ly realized, he said it really loud on the

Chorus: ...

Sendin' a letter to tell them that I love you, too
If you hear it, maybe you will know
When you hear them read the line about love's return on the radio
You'll think about the two of us and you'll come home
Wh, if you knew just how I felt why'd you make me wait
Life goes on and one while you play with my heart
Don't hold out any longer, 'cause now I know how you really feel
'Cause I heard it really loud, they say it on the air, on the

Chorus: ...

Now, if you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sittin' here with the man I sent away long ago
He fin'ly realized, he said it really loud on the 

Chorus: ...

And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon
Wo, yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air, on the

Chorus: ...
