Title  : WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING
Artist : STATUS QUO

(Words & music: Francis Rossi/Bernard Frost)

Chorus:
It sounds so nice, what you're proposing
Just once or twice and not disclosing
And not disclosing how we really really feeling
What you're proposing
The other night as I was leaving
A'looks left and right and not believing
And not believing what I'm finally believing
What you're proposing

I'll get it right if I'm composing
But then I might be runny nosing
I might be runny, runny, runny, runny nosing
But you're supposing

Don't be so sure and just supposing
We yell for more and compromising
And compromising leads to really really feeling
And just supposing

Don't get me wrong, I'm only dreaming
It can't belong, I must be dreaming
I must be dreaming, dreaming, only, only dreaming
Am I just supposing
