No Earthly curch has ever blessed our union;
no state has ever granted us permission.
No fam'ly bond has ever made us two;
no company has ever earned commission.
No debt was paid, no dowry to be gained.
No treaty over borderland or power;
no semblance of the world outside remained
to stain the beauty of this nuptual hour.
The secret marriage vow is never spoken;
the secret marriage never can be broken.
No flowers on the alter;
no Bible oath to swear.
The secret marriage vow is never spoken;
the secret marriage never can be broken.
Ooo.
