CULT OF SNAP - SNAP


Groove is quick but thick no trick
words manifest lyrics lick
(hype as hype and snap made it hyper)
beat to the brain like a bullet from a sniper
when the loser smooth like a cruiser
beat the beat down i'm the big bruiser
on to off to off on and on this is the new
new breed of rap song to the t.o.p yes the top
i rock the spot hot
to be or not to be yes it i'll be
m.c. turbo b 
(smooth to the groove yes it's party)
peace of mind time to unwind trip and dip
slip the hip now grip
to the techno house of hip
(cause this is the cuit of snap)

Hard to hold it's burning cold
we make the jam broke the most
so it can't be sold took the vic stolen taken
move to the groove dancefloor shakin'
up and down you're spinning around
you check the sound hands in the air
feet on the ground party hard hard not to party
moving close (body to body)

I for one the only son the only child
not mild but the kid is wild
cult name it's turbo jump jump jump
jump and jam the cult of snap
as snap is in command
to the point correct and exakt this is the
cult of snap
