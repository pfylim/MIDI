Title  : YOU DON'T BRING ME FLOWERS

(Words & music: N. Diamond/M. Bergman/A. Bergman)

You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me lovesongs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door at the end of the day
I remember when you couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me

Now after loving me late at night
When it's good for you
And you're feeling all right
Well, you just roll over and
You turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural to talk about forever
But used to be's don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor till we sweep them away

And baby, I remember all the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh and I learned how to cry
Well I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie
You'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore
Well you'd think I could learn how to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers anymore
