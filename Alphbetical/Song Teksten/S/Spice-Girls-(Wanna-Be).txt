Yo I tell you what I want
What I really really want.
Don`t tell me what you want
What you really really want.
I tell you what I want
What I really really want.
Don`t tell me what you want
What you really really want.
I wanna I wanna I wanna 
I wanna I wanna 
Really really really wanna
Zig a zig ah.

If you want my future forget my past.
If you want wake up with me
Better make it fast.
Now don`t go wasting
My precious time.
Get your act together.
We could be just fine.

I tell you what I want
What I really really want.
Don`t tell me what you want
What you really really want.
I wanna I wanna I wanna 
I wanna I wanna 
Really really really wanna
Zig a zig ah.

Refrain
If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends.
Make it last forever.
Friendship never ends.
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give.
Tricking is too easy
But that`s the way it is.

What d`you think about that?
Now you know how I feel.
Say you could have all my love,
Are you for real?
I won`t be hasty.
I give you a try.
If you really bug me
Then Iïll say good`bye.

Yo I tell you what I want
What I really really want.
Don`t tell me what you want
What you really really want.
I wanna I wanna I wanna 
I wanna I wanna 
Really really really wanna
Zig a zig ah.
