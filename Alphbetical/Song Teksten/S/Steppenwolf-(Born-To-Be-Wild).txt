BORN TO BE WILD - Steppenwolf 

Get your motor running
Head out on the highway
Looking for adventure
And whatever comes our way.

Yeah darling, gonna make it happen
Take the world in a loving embrace
Fire all of your guns at once
And explode into space.

I like smoke and lightning
Heavy metal thunder 
Racing with the wind
And the feeling that I'm under.

Yeah darling, gonna make it happen
Take the world in a loving embrace
Fire all of your guns at once 
And explode into space.

Like a true nature's child
We were born, born to be wild
We can climb so high
I never want to die.

Born to be wild
Born to be wild.
