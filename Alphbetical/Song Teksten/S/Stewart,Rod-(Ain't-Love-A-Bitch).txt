Title  : AIN'T LOVE A BITCH

(Words & music: Rod Stewart/Gary Grainger)

Been in pain and I've been in shame
But ain't love a bitch
I been in fights, locked away for nights
But ain't love a bitch
Been tailed, impaled, strung up
'N' nailed, 'n' left without a stitch
I been scratched 'n' taxed, finally axed
But ain't love a bitch

Oh, I didn't understand till I was seventeen
She took me way up stairs and she wiped me clean
Oh, I didn't realize she made a first class fool out of me
Oh Maggie, if you're still out there, the rest is history

You're all alone in the freezin' cold by the underground
Your hands are numb and you're feelin' dumb 'cos you been let down
You thought you were rough and kinda tough and maybe out of reach
You're acting chic, playing hide and seek, but ain't love a bitch

Oh, I must state right here I been there before?
My eyes are closed and to my friends I still don't know the score
Oh, don't underestimate the strength of it
It may be unwise to analyze even the cause of it

You're driving home late one night and on the radio comes
An old familiar song you used to know so well

Oh, I can't comprehend this thing called love
Maybe it's a matter of act I just can't grow up
Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
(Just a boy) all I really wanna know
Is there one sweet angel that can make me smile?

Torrential rains, wars and hurricanes I wouldn't budge an inch
And your rent's unpaid and your team lose again
But ain't love a bitch
You can lose your job, your home and your head
But ain't love a bitch
Take it or leave it, some day you'll feel it
'Cos love is the bitch
