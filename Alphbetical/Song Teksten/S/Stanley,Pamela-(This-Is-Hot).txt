Title  : THIS IS HOT

(Words & music: Joachim Heider/Pamela Stanley)

This is hot, hot, hot, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is hot, hot, hot, yeah, yeah, yeah

Heaven waits before your eyes right here with me
I tell no lies and this is hot
The gypsy dancer in my soul is gone for good
That story's old and this is hot

And so my love as you will see
Your lucky day was meeting me
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot, oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot 'cause baby, I'm the one to set you free
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot, oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot 'cause baby, I'm the one to set you free

This is hot, hot, hot, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is hot, hot, hot, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've heard of all your fancy plays, exciting and romantic ways
And this is hot
And now we're standing face to face
I feel the charm of your embrace
And this is hot

And so my love before you try to stay with me
Here is my reply
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot, oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot 'cause baby, I'm the one to set you free
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot

Oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot 'cause baby I hold the key
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot, oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot 'cause baby, I'm the one to set you free
This is hot and don't you forget it
This is hot, oh, you'll never regret it
This is hot and babe, I hold the key

Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
