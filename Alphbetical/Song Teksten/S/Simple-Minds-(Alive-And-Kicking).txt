SIMPLE MINDS - ALIVE AND KICKING

You turn me on
You lift me up
And like the sweetest cup I'd share with you
You lift me up
Don't you ever stop, I'm here with you
Now it's all or nothing
'Cause you say you'll follow through
You follow me and I, I, I follow you

What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when the love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tide
What's it gonna take to make a dream survive
Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside
Who's gonna save you, alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, until your love is
Alive

You lift me up to the crucial top, so I can see
You lead me on till the feelings come
and the lights that shine on
But if that don't mean nothing like if someday
it should fall through
You'd take me home where the magic's form
And I'll be with you

What you gonna do when things go wrong
What you gonna do when it all cracks up
What you gonna do when your love burns down
What you gonna do when the flames go up
Who is gonna come and turn the tide
What's it gonna take to make a dream survive
Who's got the touch to calm the storm inside
Don't say goodbye, don't say goodbye
In the final seconds who's gonna save you?

Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, love is alive and kicking
Alive and kicking
Stay until your love is, love is alive and kicking
