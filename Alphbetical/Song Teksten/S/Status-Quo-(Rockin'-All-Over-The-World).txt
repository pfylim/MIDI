Singer : STATUS QUO 
Title  : ROCKIN' ALL OVER THE WORLD

(Words & music: John Fogerty)

Ah here we are and here we are
And here we go
On and on, and we're hittin' the road
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

Ah giddy up and giddy up
And get away
We're going crazy
And we're going today
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

Chorus:
And I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it
I la-la-la like it, la-la-la like
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

Gonna tell your mama
What you're gonna do
Come on out, get your dancing shoes
Here we go, rockin' all over the world

Chorus: ...4x...
