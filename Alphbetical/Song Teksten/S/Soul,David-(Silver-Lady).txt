Title  : SILVER LADY

(Words & music: Tony Macaulay/G. Stephan)

Tired of drifting, searching, shifting
From town to town
Every time I slip and slide a little further down
I can't make it if you won't take me back
After everything I put you through

Chorus:
But honey, you're my last hope
And who else can I turn to
Come on Silver Lady, take my word
I won't run out on you again
Believe me, oh I've seen the light
It's just one more night without you
Here I am, a million miles from home
Indiana wind and rain
Cut through me, I am lost and alone
Chilled to the bone, Silver Lady

Double talkers, back street walkers
At every turn, seedy motels, and no star hotels
Till I had to learn
That the one shining thing
In my life was the sweet love I had with you

Chorus: ...
