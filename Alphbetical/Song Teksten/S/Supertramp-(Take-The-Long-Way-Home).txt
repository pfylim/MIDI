So you think you're a Romeo
playing a part in a picture show,
well take the long way home,
take the long way home.
Cause you're the joke of the neighborhood,
why should you care if you're feeling good,
well take the long way home,
take the long way home.
But there are times that you 
feel you're part of the scenery,
all the greenery is comin' down, boy.
And then your wife seems to think you're
part of the furniture,
oh it's peculiar, she used to be so nice.

When lonely days turn to lonely nights
you take a trip to the city lights,
and take the long way home,
take the long way home.
You never see what you want to see,
forever playing to the gallery,
you take the long way home,
take the long way home.
And when you're up on the stage 
it's so unbelievable, unforgetable
how they adore you.
But then your wife seems to think 
you're losing your sanity,
oh it's calamity, oh is there no way out ? Oh !

Well does it feel that your life's become
a catastrophe,
oh it has to be for you to grow, boy.
When you look through the years and see
what you could have been,
oh what you might have been 
if you had had  more time.
So, when the day comes to settle down well,
who's to blame if you're not around ?
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home,
you took the long way home.

Ah, ah.
Long way home, long way home, long way home,
long way home, long way home, long way home,
long way home.
