History recalls how great the fall can be,
while ev'rybody's sleeping the boats put out to sea.
Born on the wings of time it seemed the answers
were so easy to find.
"Too late", the prophets cry, the island's sinking
let's take to the sky.

Called the man a fool, stripped him of his pride.
While ev'ryone was laughing up until the day he died.
Oh, tho' the wound went deep still he's calling
us out of our sleep my friends we're not alone,
he waits in silence to lead us all home.

So you tell me that you find it  hard to grow,
well, I know, I know, I know.
And you tell me that you've many seeds to sow, 
well, I know, I know, I know.

Can you hear what I'm saying ?
Can you see the parts that I'm playing ?
Holy man, rocker man, come on queenie,
joker man, spider man, blueeyed meanie.

So you found your solution, 
what will be your last contribution ?
Live it up, rip it up, why so lazy ? 
give it out, dish it out, let's go crazy, yeah !
