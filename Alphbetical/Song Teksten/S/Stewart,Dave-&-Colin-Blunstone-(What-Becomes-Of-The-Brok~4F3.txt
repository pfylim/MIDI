Title  : WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED
Artist : DAVE STEWART & COLIN BLUNSTONE 

(Words & music: James Dean/Paul Riser/William Weatherspoon)

As I walk this land with broken dreams
I have visions of many things
Love's happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

Chorus:
What becomes of the broken hearted?
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I'v got to find some kind of peace of mind

Maybe

The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tublin' down
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and prayin' for someone to care
Always movin' and goin' nowhere

Chorus:

Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone thought there's a growing need
All is lost here's not place for a beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now

Chorus: ...

I'll be searching ev'rywhere
Just to finde someone to care
I'll be looking every day I know I'm gonna find a way

Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching ev'rywhere
Looking for someone to share

Chorus: ...
