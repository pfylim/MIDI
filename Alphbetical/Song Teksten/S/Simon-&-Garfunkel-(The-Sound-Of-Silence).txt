Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again,
because a vision softly creeping,
left it's seeds while I was sleeping.
And the vision that was plated in my brain
still remains within the sound of silence.

I restless dreams I walked alone through narrow streets
of cobble stone, beneath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp.
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
split the night and touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw tenthousand people maybe more.
People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening.
People writing songs that voices never shared no one dared
disturb the sound of silence.

Fools, said I, you don't know silence like a cancer grows,
hear my words that I might teach you,
take my arms that I might reach you.
But my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed
in the wells of silence.

And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out it's warning
in the words that it was forming.
And the sings said the words of the prophets are written on the
subway walls and tenement halls.

And whisper in the sounds of silence.
