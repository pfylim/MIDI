Was a sunny day
not a cloud was in the sky
not a negative word was heard
from the people passing by
was a sunny day
all the birdies in the trees
and the radio's singing song
all the favorite melodies.

He was a navy man
Stationed in Newport News
she was a high school queen
with nothing left to lose.

Was a sunny day
not a cloud was in the sky
not a negative word was heard
from the people passing by
was a sunny day
all the birdies in the trees
and the radio's singing song
all the favorite melodies.

Her name was Lorelei
she was his only girl
she called him Speedoo
but his Christian name
was Mr. Earl.

Was a sunny day
not a cloud was in the sky
not a negative word was heard
from the people passing by
was a sunny day
all the birdies in the trees
and the radio's singing song
all the favorite melodies.
