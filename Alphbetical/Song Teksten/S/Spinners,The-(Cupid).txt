Title  : CUPID
Artist : THE SPINNERS

(Words & music: Sam Cooke)

Chorus:
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go
Straight to my lover's heart for me, for me
Cupid , please, hear my cry
And let your arrow fly
Straight to my lover's heart for me

Now, l don't mean to bother you, but l'm in distress
There's danger of me losing all of my happiness 
For I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
And this you can fix, oh

Chorus: ...
Now, Cupid, if your arrow makes her love
strong for me
I promise I will love here untill eternity
I know between the two of us her heart we
steel
Help me if you will, oh

Chorus: ...

Now, Cupid don't you hear me calling you,
Need you, Cupid !
