Singer : THE SPECIALS
Title  : GANGSTER

(Words & music: The Specials)

Why must you record my phone calls
Are you planning a bootleg lp?
Said you've been threatened by gangsters
Now it's you that's threatening me

Can't fight corruption with contricks
They use the law to commit crime
And I dread, dread to think what the future'll bring
When we're living in gangster time
(Don't call me scarface)
Don't offer us legal protection
They use the law to commit crimes
I dread to think what the future will bring
When we're living in real gangster time
(Bernie Rhodes knows, don't argue)

Can't interrupt while I'm talking
Or they'll confiscate all your guitars
And catch twenty two says if I sing
The truth they won't make me an overnight star
