Singer : BILLY SWAN 
Title  : I CAN HELP

If you've got a problem
I don't care what it is
If you need a hand
I can assure you of this
I can help
I've got two strong arms
I can help
It would sure do me good
To do you good
Let me help

It's a fact that people get lonely
Ain't nothing new
But a woman like you baby
Should never have the blues
Let me help
I've got two for me
Let me help
It would sure do me good
To do you good
Let me help

When I go to sleep at night
Your always a part of my dreams
Holding me tight telling me everything
I want to hear
Don't forget me baby
All you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you
I can do anything at all let me help
If your child needs a daddy I can help
It would sure do me good
To do you good
Let me help
