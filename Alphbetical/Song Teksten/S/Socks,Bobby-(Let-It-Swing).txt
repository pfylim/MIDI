BOBBY SOCKS - LET IT SWING

Look at me I'm climbing up a ladder
And I'm half-way bound with reaching for the stars
No I don't have time to swing no time for laughter
But a voice inside my head keeps singing loud

Refrain:
Let it swing
And let it rock'n'roll
Let it swing
And let the feeling take control
Oh ah oh
Let it swing and let it rock'n'roll

There's a guy on top
Who's sittin' find forever
Got the world and everything that's called the best
Now he don't say much
Unless there's room for talking oh oh
Just a sign above the door to his success

Refrain: ...

Now you don't have time to swing
No time for laughter oh oh
The voice inside your head keeps singing loud
singin' loud

Refrain: ...
