Singer : THE SWEET 
Title  : THE SIX TEENS

Where were you in '68
In '68 Julie was Johnny's date
Two kids growing together
Livin' each day as if time was slipping away
Oh they were just sixteen and their love
A teenage dream
They passed the time, they crossed the line
The line that ran between
Julie and Johnny now you've made it

But life goes on
You know it ain't easy
And you've just gotta be strong
If you're one of the sixteens
And life goes on, you know
You know it ain't easy

And you know you'll never go wrong
'Cos you're all part of the sixteen
Suzie and Davey got to make the big time
Maybe they can put it all together in a show
that lasts forever
Oh they would walk the strip at nights
And dream they saw their names in lights
On desolation boulevard they'll light the faded light
Suzie and Davey you can make it

So where were you in '68, when Bobby and Billy thought
That '68 was out of date
They look the flowers from their hair
And tried to make us all aware
Too bad - too late

So they lived from day to day
They tried to do it all their way
But '68 was '68, no matter what they say
Bobby and Billy, maybe you'll make it one day
