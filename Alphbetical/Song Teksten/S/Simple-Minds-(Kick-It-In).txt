SIMPLE MINDS - KICK IT IN

(Words & music: Simple Minds)

Love gives me poetry
Stays up all night and puts a curse on me
Oh anything you want
Turn round I'll take you there
I know it's gonna be
Take the shackles off me
This city's gone
I'm gone over there

Kick it in kick it in
Build it up and burn it down again
Kick it in kick it in
Burn down to the ground
Kick it in kick it in
Tell me 'bout the place you've been
I don't want it there's a fever going around

Take a walk downtown
See what's going down
If you want to find the hidden key
There's nothing here on me
Andy city anywhere
Any color I don't care
You belong to me
That's the way it's gonna be
Kick it in kick it in

Yeah kick it in kick it in
Raise it up and let it live again
Feel your body shake and take off
You could lie but keep it in
Keep me down here wonderin'
So what's it gonna be
Come on in

I like the shape you're in
You keep me wondering
Wondering, wondering
Eyes upon you black and brown
Spread your love all over town
Give me fire body heat
Say hello to me
I want to go anywhere
Andy color I don't care
Don't believe in all you see
And don't get caught up

Kick it in kick it in
Tell me 'bout this love you've been
Kick it in kick it in
Turn this life around
Kick it in kick it in
Shake the ghost from deep within
Close the door down
Don't let the demons in

Kick it in kick it in
I only want to be your friend
Put your hand in my hand
And take off with me

Listen baby I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going, going home
Come on walk to me

'Cause I know what I see
Kick it in
Kick it in, kick it in
Tell me 'bout the place you're in

I've gotta new gold dream
I'm moving on
I'm moving on
You're moving on
You're moving on, yeah
You're moving on, yeah
Kick it in oh kick it in
I'm moving on
