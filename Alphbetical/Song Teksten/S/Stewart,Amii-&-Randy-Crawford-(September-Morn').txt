
10. September Morn' - AMII STEWART & RANDY CRAWFORD

Stay for just a while
Stay and let me look at you 
It's been so long, I hardly knew it 
Standin' in the door 
Stay with me a while
I only wanna talk to you
We've travelled halfway 'round the world
To find ourself again
September morn'
We danced untill the night became 
A brand new day.
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic plays
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
Look at what you've done
Why you've become a grow-up girl
I still can hear you cryin'
In the corner of your room
And look how far we've come:
So far from where we used to be
But not so far that we've
Forgotten how it was before.
September morn'
Do you remember how we danced that night away?
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic plays
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn'
We danced untill the night became 
A brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic plays
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morn'
We danced untill the night became 
A brand new day
Two lovers playing scenes
From some romantic plays
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
September morning
Still can make me feel that way
