2. I FEEL LIKE BUDDY HOLLY - ALVIN STARDUST

Intro (10 Takte Pad-Synthesizer inkl. Auftakt Vers 1):

Vers 1:
I watched the planes come in  on the early morning flights
But I could not stand to see them land without you.
Now I'm thumbing through my fortyfives  on another endless night 
And the same old lines  going back in time
Tell me this is nothing new. 

1.Refrain:
Well, I feel like Buddy Holly 'cause it's "Raining In My Heart"
All the sad songs  take me back to you  now that we are apart ..
Now I know how  Paul McCartney felt when he got up to stay:
I wish it was "Yesterday"!

Bridge (9 Takte instrumental -Pad-Synthesizer- inkl. Auftakt Vers 2):

Vers 2:
So I sit here playing Solitaire, it's a game I know so well 
Ever since that day when you called to say "It's over!" 
Now I've made my reservation at the "Heartbreak Hotel" 
While I'm living without you, I'm thinking about you,
Like "Only The Lonely" do!

2.Refrain:
Well, I feel like  Buddy Holly 'cause its "Raining In My Heart" 
All the sad songs  take me back to you  now that we are apart ..
Now I know what  Paul Simon ment  by the words he found:
I wish I was "Homeward Bound"! ...

Bridge (3 Takte instrumental, incl. Auftakt 3. Refrain):

3.Refrain:
Well, I feel like  Buddy Holly 'cause it's "Raining In My Heart" 
All the sad songs  take me back to you  now that we are apart 
Now I know how  Paul McCartney felt  when he got up to say:
I wish it was "Yesterday"! 
I wish it was "Yesterday"! 
I wish it was "Yesterday"!
