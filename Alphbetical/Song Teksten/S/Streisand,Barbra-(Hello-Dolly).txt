                      Hello Dolly


Refrain

Hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly,
It's so nice to have you back where you belong.
You're looking swell, Dolly, we can tell, Dolly,
You're still glowin' you're still crowin'
You're still goin' strong.
We feel the room swayin' for the band's playin' 
one of our old fav'rite songs from way back when.

So take he wrap, fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas
Dolly'll never go away again!

Hello Dolly, well, ...

So golly gee, fellas, find her a vacant knee, fellas
Dolly'll never go away, Dolly'll never go away,
Dolly'll never go away again.
