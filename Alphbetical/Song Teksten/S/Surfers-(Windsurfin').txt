Ev'ry day when our homework is done
We go to the beach, gonna have some fun
The ocean is blue and the weather is fine
With the surfboard sailing all over the sea
It's a new sensation for you and me
I sure can say we'll have a wonderful time

Chorus:
Talkin', about surfin' surfin' windsurfin'
Surfin' surfin' windsurfin'
V-A-C-A-T-I-O-N and it's fun fun fun
Ev'rybody has fun fun fun
Ev'rybody has fun fun fun
Windsurfin' fun

Drivin' down the shore in daddy's Cadillac
With a little girl hanging around my neck
Sunset Boulevard, look out, here I come
And when the evening comes and the sun goes down
Surfer boys and girls coming from miles around
'Cause we're gonna have a real party tonight

Chorus: ...
