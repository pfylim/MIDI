Don't tell me your troubles.
I got trouble of my own,
don't tell me your troubles,
just leave me alone,
leave me alone,
go on home.
Tell it to a friend,
I got troubles of my own.
You say your sweetheart left you,
well watcha think about me ?
You got the same old heartaches,
and them same old miseries.

Leave me alone,
go on home.
Tell it to a friend,
I got troubles of my own.
Well it happens to the best of us,
that's what they say,
so take it boy, like a man,
and don't stand in my way.

You tell me that she's no good,
she's mean as she can be
it's written all over your lonesome face,
any heartbroke fool can see.
Leave me alone,
go on home.
Tell it to a friend,
I got troubles of my own, troubles of my own.

Well it happens to the best of us,
that's what they say,
so take it boy, like a man,
and don't stand in my way.

You tell me that she's no good,
she's mean as she can be
it's written all over your lonesome face,
any heartbroke fool can see.
Leave me alone,
go on home.
Tell it to a friend,
I got troubles of my own, troubles of my own.

Leave me alone,
go on home.
Tell it to a friend,
I got troubles of my own, troubles of my own.
I got troubles of my own, troubles of my own.
I got troubles of my own.
