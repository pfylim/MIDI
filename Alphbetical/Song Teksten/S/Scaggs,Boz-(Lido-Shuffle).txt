(Words & music: Boz Scaggs)

Lido missed the boat that day, he left the shack 
But that was all he missed, and he ain't coming back 
A tombstone bar in a jukejoint car he made a stop 
Just long enough to grab the handle off the top 
Next stop Chi-town Lido put the money down and let it roll 
 
He said one more job ought to get it 
One last shot 'fore we quit it 
One for the road 
 
Lido, wooooh, he's for the money, he's for the show 
Lido's a waitin' for the go 
Lido, wooooh 
He said one more job ought to get it 
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one more for the road 
 
Lido be runnin' havin' great big fun until he got the note 
Sayin' tow the line or blow it and that was all she wrote 
He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the borderline 
Goin' for broke 
 
Sayin' one more hit ought to do it 
This joint ain't nothin' to it 
One more for the road 
 
Lido, wooooh, he's for the money, he's for the show 
Lido's a waitin' for the go 
Lido, wooooh 
He said one more job ought to get it 
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one more for the road 
 
(solo) 
 
Lido, wooooh, he's for the money, he's for the show 
Lido's a waitin' for the go 
Lido, wooooh 
One more job ought to get it
