Singer : STATUS QUO 
Title  : ACCIDENT PRONE

(Words & music: Williams/Hutchins)

Chorus:
I'm a lay-by lover
And you're just another
Who just wants to hit and run
Now you're on your own
Cos I'm accident prone
And I hope that you have your fun

They say the devil loves his own
And lady you just got to roll
He drives your modus operandi
Well lady you don't get this soul
What you call love I can't take no more
Go knock on someone else's door

Chorus: ...

Cos you specialize in your own kind of lies
Lady you just hit and run
I just wanna say, you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

I tried to love you my way
But lady you just wouldn't slow down
You drove a right on through me
When other guys came round
What you call love wouldn't give a stray
I wouldn't treat a dog that way

Chorus: ...

I just wanna say, you keep driving that way
And one day you will be undone

One day you'll have to slow down
And lady it could be too late
You keep on acceleratin'
And lady I can see your face
No one wants a second-hand car
They know has been pushed too far

Chorus: ...

You're a draggin' me down with this riding around
And one day you will be undone
