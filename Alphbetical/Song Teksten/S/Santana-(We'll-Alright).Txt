(Words & music: Norman Petty/Buddy Holly/Jerry Allison/Joe Mauldin)

Well alright
So I'm being foolish
Well alright, let the people know
About the dreams and wishes you wish in the night

Well alright, well alright
Oh we'll live and love with all our might

It's alright when people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way

Chorus: ...
