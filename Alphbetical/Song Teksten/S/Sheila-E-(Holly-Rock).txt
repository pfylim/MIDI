A funky little thing called holly rock
It might be a dance it might be a song
It might have you rock-in baby all night long

All the little brothers gather 'round

Sheila E's my name, holly rock's my game
I'm funky as I want to be
Line up a hundred and swear to god
I'll rock 'em till you just can't see

Mass appeal, a little girls smile
I'll make you happy, baby all the while
'Cause I'm bad good god, and if you got a big enough stick
Come on ever baby to the holly rock
Don't you want to learn a new trick?

Holly rock Holly rock
Holly rock Holly rock

Rock rock holly rock everybody want to holly rock
