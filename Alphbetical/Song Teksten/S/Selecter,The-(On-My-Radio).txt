Title  : ON MY RADIO

(Words & music: Neal Davies)

I bought my baby
A red radio
He played it all day
A go go, a go go
He liked to dance to it
Down in the street
He said he loved me
But he loved the beat

But when I switch on
Rotate the dial
I can see it ain't 
Driving him so wild
I bought my baby
A red radio
He said he loved me
But he had to go

Chorus:
It's just the same old show
On my radio (4x)

On my radio
On my radio
On my radio

I bought my baby
A red radio
He played it all day
A go go, a go go
He liked to dance to it
Down in the street
He said he loved me
But he loved the beat

Chorus: ...

On my radio
On my radio
On my radio
