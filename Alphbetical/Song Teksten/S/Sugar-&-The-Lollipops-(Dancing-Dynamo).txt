Wriggle like a snake, you can't get away
Make you move like you never did before
I'm gonna make you shout an' there ain't no way out
Come and join me now an' I'll show you how

Chorus:
Hey-hoy, come on, let's go, I'm your dancing dynamo
Hey-hoy, come on, let's go, I'm your dancing dynamo
I'm your dancing dynamo

Sugar's got you know what I mean?
Knew you could do it, just need a push
I'm gonna make you shout, there ain't no war out
Come and join me now an' I'll show you how

Chorus: ...

Everybody knows me, I never rest
Once I'm started, I can't stop
I'm gonna make you shout, there ain't no way out
Come on and join me now an' I'll show you how

Chorus: ...
