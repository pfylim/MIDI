Title  : THE EYE OF JENNY
Artist : SANDY COAST

(Words & music: P.J. Vermeulen)

Jenny was only nine years old
Kidsister of someone I know
And she was pretty
Ooh, yes, she was

She was a gorgeous little girl
Happiest thing in the whole wide world
And she was pretty
Ooh, yes, she was

And then I left the place to become a man
I never thought I'd see her again
And I even failed remembering her name
But the other night at the Studio '54
She came suddenly walking through the front door
And she settled down in my mind again

Chorus:
I can live for another thousand years
When I see the eyes of Jenny
Feels like I'm sailing to another place another time
There ain't no more worries, no more fears
When I see the eyes of Jenny
It's like they take me to where she knows
I'll find a little peace of mind

She told me she's almost 25
Been through some struggle and some strife
And she was pretty
Ooh, like she was

It's not the colour, not the size
Guess it's the promise in those eyes
That makes her pretty
Ooh, like she was

And then I left the place and became a man
Don't know if I'll ever see her again
But I'll always be remembering her name
'Cause the other night at the Studio '54
She came suddenly walking through the front door
And she settled down in my mind again

Chorus: ...
