LISA STANSFIELD - ALL AROUND THE WORLD

(Words & music: Lisa Stansfield/Ian Pavaney/Andy Morris)

I don't know where my baby is
But I'll find him somewhere and somehow
I've got to let him know how much I care
I'll never give up looking for my baby

Chorus:
Been around the world and I, I, I
I can't find my baby
I don't know when, I don't know why
Why he's gone away
And I don't know where he can be, my baby
But I'm gonna find him

We had a quarrel and I let myself go
I said so many things, things he didn't know
And I was oh oh so bad and I don't think
He's coming back
He gave the reasons, the reasons he should go
And he said things he hadn't said before
And he was oh oh so mad and I don't think
He's coming back, coming back

I did too much lying, wasted too much time
Now I'm here and crying

Chorus: ...

So open hearted, he never did me wrong
I was the one, the weakest one of all
And now I'm oh oh so sad 
And I don't think he's coming back
Coming back

Chorus: ...
