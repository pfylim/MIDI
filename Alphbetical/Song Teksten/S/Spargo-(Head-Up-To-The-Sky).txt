Title  : HEAD UP TO THE SKY
Artist : SPARGO

(Words & music: Ellert Driessen)

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Na na na na na na na na na na na
There's a lot of talking goin' round
That I'm no good at all
But can you find one reason baby, yeah
Just to let me fall

I will always love you
No matter what they say, no
Let the people do their talkin'
We're gonna find our way

Chorus:
Keep your head up to the sky
You'll be flying high, on a rainbow, in the air
There's no way that you can fly
To keep on going, anywhere

When you're feelin' lonely, feelin' blue
(And) you don't know what to do
Just remember one thing baby yeah
Someone cares for you

Just keep your head together
See the bright side of your life
Thru' rain and stormy weather
We surely will survive

Chorus: ...

What the people say, it hasn't got a meaning
We will find a way
Well maybe it won't work the first time
Look up to the sky and you will find a rainbow
Better luck next time
I hope you'll find a way to go on
Soon, soon

I will always love you
No matter what they say, no
Let the people do their talkin'
We're gonna find our way

Chorus: ...2x...
