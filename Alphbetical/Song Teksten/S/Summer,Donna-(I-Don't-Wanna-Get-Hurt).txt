DONNA SUMMER - I DON'T WANNA GET HURT

(Words & music: Stock/Aitken/Waterman)

I don't need all my friends to tell me
Things that I already know
Like in the best of all worlds
You shouldn't forget self-control
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing
'Cause he said it's more than a feeling
And I said I need you too
Am I just a fool

Refrain:
I don't wanna get hurt
I don't wanna get hurt
I'm not looking for just another heartache
I don't wanna get hurt
But I know it's a chance I've got to take

I don't need all my friends to remind me
Mistakes that I've already made
I just leave the past behind me
And go on believing that I'll be okay
Some things are only human
When he said he'd always need me
And I said I want you too
am I just a fool

Refrain: ...

Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Just another heartache
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt

I don't need all my friends to tell me
Things that I already know
Like in the best of all worlds
You shouldn't forget self-control
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing
'Cause he said it's more than a feeling
And I said I need you too
Am I just a fool

Refrain: ...
