I take my troubles on a friday night
to the heart of the bistro.
Among the shadows and the low low lights
I can find a release.
My favorite waitress will be here tonight
I love the way she wears those fish-net tights.
She's so hard to resist
in this mondo sinistro.

She picks a menu up and throws it my way
with a flick of her wrist.
I'm sitting hoping that the night might take
a romantical twist.
I order chicken and a chilled chablis,
she brings me grapefruit and a cup of tea.
She's a little mephisto
in this mondo sinistro.

I say, I really love her dark brown eyes
and the way that they tease.
I tell her everytime  she passes by
I grow weak in the knees.
I ask her would she like to come and play,
she blows my candle out and walks away.
I just cease to exist
in this mondo sinsitro.
