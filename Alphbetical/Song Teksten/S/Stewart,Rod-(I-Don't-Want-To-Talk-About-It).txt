Title  : I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT

(Words & music: Danny Whitten)

I can tell by your eyes
That you've prob'bly been crying forever
And the stars in the sky don't mean
Nothing to you in the mirror

Refrain:
I don't want to talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here won't you listen to my heart
Wooh, heart

If I stand all alone will the shadow hide
The color of my heart blue falls the tears
Black fall the nights were a part
And the stars don't mean nothing
To you in the mirror

Refrain: ...2x...
