SPANDAU BALLET - FIGHT FOR OURSELVES

Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves (4x)

So many people so many problems
There in pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well if life is here before my eyes
Then I find it so hard to see
How the methods that we're told to use
Are gonna make us free
Until then I say

Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves (2x)

All through the mystery
All through the heartache
She's got the only single thing
That I'd never throw away
Oh when lightning strikes
For the second time
You'd come and pull me through
It's a battle that we all must make
So show me what to do
And you said

Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
(We've gotta fight for ourselves)
Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
There's a feeling growing
That is in this land
There's a soul that's burning
And it's in your hand
Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
Fight for ourselves

Oh, so many people and there's so many problems
There in pretty city lights
Where we've thrown it all away
Well if life is here before my eyes

Are gonna make us free

Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
(We've gotta fight for ourselves)
Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
Oh, there's a feeling growing

There's a soul that's burning
And it's in your hand
Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
Fight for ourselves fight for ourselves
We've gotta fight for ourselves

Everybody fight for ourselves
(Everybody gotta fight for themselves)
Everybody fight for ourselves (3x)
Everybody we've gotta fight for ourselves
