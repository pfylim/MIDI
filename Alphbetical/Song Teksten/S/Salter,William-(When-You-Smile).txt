When you smile, I can see, you were born, born for me.
And for me, you will be, do or die.
Oh baby let me hold you, you make me want to hold you.
When you smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile, smile,

When you smile, I can see, there is hope, hope for me.
And for you, if you know what I mean.
I'm gonna sock it to you, I'm gonna rock it to you.
Ev'ry time, time, time, time, time, time, time, 

When you smile, I can see, you and me, me and you.
There is love in your eyes, when you smile.
Oh baby let me love you, you gotta let me love you.

La, la, la,   la, la, la,   la, la,
la, la, la,   la, la, la,   la, la, la, 
la, al, la, la, la,   la, la,  
la, la, la, la, la,la   la,
la, la,  la,  la,  la,  la,  la,  la,  la.
