Chorus:
Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls, sad girls
Sad girls, sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night, walkin'
Picking up on all kinds of strangers
If the price is right you can score
If you're pocket's nice, but you want a good time
You ask yourself who they are like everybody else
They come from near and far

Chorus: ...

Friday night and the strip is hot
Sun's gone down, they're about to trot
Spirit's high and they look hot
Do you wanna get down
Now don't ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else they wanna be a star

Chorus: ...

Sad girls, sad girls, you such a dirty bad girl
Beep beep uh uh
Beep beep uh uh

Now you and me we are both the same
But you call yourself by different names
Now your mama won't like it when she finds out
The girl is out at night
Hey mister, have you got a dime
Mister, do you want to spend some time, oh yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I'll be your baby,, come on and spend it on me
Hey mister, I'll spend some time with you
With you, you're fine, with you

Bad girls, beep beep
Bad girls, beep beep
Hey mister, hey mister
