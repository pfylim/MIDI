Title  : HE'S THE GREATEST DANCER

(Words & music: Bernard Edwards/Nile Rodgers)

Chorus:
Oh, what wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what wow
That I've ever seen
Oh, what wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh, what wow

One night in a disco
On the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruising with my fav'rite gang
The place was so boring
Filled with out of towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring
But I felt my eyes staring at a guy
Who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Chorus: ...

The champion of dance, his moves will put you in trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance, but not conceit, as a man he's complete
My cräme de la cräme, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers
Heaven knows from his head down to his toes
Halson, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Chorus: ...
