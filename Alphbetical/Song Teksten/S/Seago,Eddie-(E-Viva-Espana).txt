All the ladies fell for Rudolph Valentino,
he had a beano back in those balmy days.
He knew ev'ry time you meet an icy creature
you've got to teach her hot blooded latin ways.
But even Rudy would have felt the strain
of making smooth advances in the rain.

Oh this year I'm off to sunny Spain
E (Y) Viva Espana.
I'm taking the Costa Brava plane
E (Y) Viva Espana.
If you'd like to chat a matador in some cool cabana,
and meet senoritas by the score Espana porfavor.

Quite by chance to hot romance I found the answer
Flamenco dancers are by far the finest bet
there was one who whispered "Whoo hasta la vista"
each time I kissed him behind the castanet
he rattled his maracas close to me
in no time I was trembling at the knee.

Oh this year I'm off to sunny Spain
E (Y) Viva Espana.
I'm taking the Costa Brava plane
E (Y) Viva Espana.
If you'd like to chat a matador in some cool cabana,
and meet senoritas by the score Espana porfavor.

When they first arrive the girls are pink and pasty
but oh so tasty as soon as they go brown
I guess they know every fellow will be queueing
to do the wooing his girlfriend won't allow,
but still I think today's a lucky day
that's why I've learned to shout "ole"
