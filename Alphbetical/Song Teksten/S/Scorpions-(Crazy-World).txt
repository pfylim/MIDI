I get up in the morning
for my dose of the news
crawl right back in the sack girl
had enough of the truth
spend your dollars and rubels
buy a piece of the wall
build it up in your backyard
I'm so sick of it all.

Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.

Drivin' down to the city
doin' 155
better late then never
I'm more dead than alive
we can find the Titanic
put a mann on the moon
but we can't fix out backyard
man we better start soon.

Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.

I don't want to hear about it
I wish it would be worlds away
you know the more I think about it
the more I feel we need to change
I get up         (in a crazy, crazy world)
we all live      (in a crazy, crazy world)
Ooh Yeah         (it's a crazy, crazy world)
I gotta get out  (of this crazy, crazy world)

Goin' home to my baby
it's been another hard day
bust my balls for the tax man
so what else can I say
they spent our money on missiles
for the third world war
now they're stacked in my backyard
we don't need them no more.

Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.
Ooh, it's a crazy world.
