Singer : SANTANA 
Title  : I'LL BE WAITING

(Words & music: Carlos Santana)

It's been so long since I've seen your face
Yet I know soon I'll have your embrace
I'll be waiting, waiting just for you

Life keeps a float and my love grows and grows
You are the lightin'
I'll be waiting, waiting just for you

Oh it's been a long long time
I don't mind
Rhythm deep to know the earth
Keep waiting waiting waiting just for you
