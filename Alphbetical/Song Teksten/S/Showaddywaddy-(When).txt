When, when, when, when:
When, wehn, when you smile, when you smile at me
well, we`ll know our love will always be
when, when, when you kiss, when you kiss me right
I, I don`t want ever to say good-night!

I need you, I want you near me
I love you, yes, I do and I hope you hear me
When, when, when I say, when I say "Be mine" -
If, if you will, I know all will be fine -
When you will be mine - oh, baby -

I need you, I want you near me
Oh, baby, I love you, yes, I do and I hope you hear me
When will you be mine

When, when you smile, when you smile at me...
When will you be mine.
Oh, baby, I need you, I want you near me ...
