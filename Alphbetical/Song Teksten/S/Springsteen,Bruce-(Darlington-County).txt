Driving in to Darlington County
me and Wayne on the Fourth of July
Driving in to Darlington County
looking for some work on the county line.

We drove down from New York City
where the girls are pretty
but they just want to know your name

Driving in to Darlington City
got a union connection with an uncle of Wayne's
we drove eight-hundred miles without seeing a cop
we got Rock and Roll music blasting off
the t-top singing.

Hey little girl standing on the corner
today's your lucky day for sure all right
me and my buddy we're from New York City
we got 200$, we want to rock all night
girl, you're looking at two big spenders
why the world don't know what me and Wayne might do.

Our pa's each own one of the World Trade Centers
for a kiss and a smile I'll give mine all to you
come on baby take a seat on my fender
it's a long night and tell me what else were
you gonna do
just me and you, we could sha la la.

Little girl sitting in the window
ain't seen my buddy in seven days
County man tells me the same thing
he don't work and he don't get paid
little girl you're so young and pretty
walk with me and you can have your way
and we'll leave this Darlington City for a 
ride down that Dixie Highway.

Driving out of Darlington County
my eyes seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
driving out of Darlinton County seen
Wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a 
state trooper's Ford
