Title  : NO MORE HEROES

(Words & music: The Stranglers)

Whatever happened to Leon Trotsky
He got an ice pick that mad his ear burn
Whatever happened to dear old Lenny
The great Elmyra and Sancho Panza
Whatever happened to the heroes
Whatever happened to the heroes

Whatever happened to all the heroes
All the Shakespearoes
They watched their Rome burn
Whatever happened to the heroes
Whatever happened to the heroes
No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore

Whatever happened to all the heroes
All the Shakespearoes
They watched their Rome burn
Whatever happened to the heroes
Whatever happened to the heroes
No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore

No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore
No more heroes anymore
