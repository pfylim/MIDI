Singer : DONNA SUMMER 
Title  : COULD IT BE MAGIC

Spirit move me
Ev'ry time I'm near you
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind
Sweet Melissa
Angel of my life time
Answer to all answers I can find

Baby, I love you
Come, come, come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now
Now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last

Lady take me
High up on a hillside
High up where the stallion meets the sun
I could love you
Build my world around you
Never leave you till my life is done

Baby I love you
Come, come, come into my arms
Let me know the wonder of all of you
Baby, I want you now
Now, now and hold on fast
Could this be the magic at last
