Love is a hunger
that burns in my soul,
Bu t you never
notice the pain.
Love is an answer
that won't let me go.
I reach out
to hold you
but you push me away
you always convince
me to stay.

And I wonder why 
we hold on
with tears in our eyes,
and I wonder why
we have to break down to just
make things right.
And I wonder why
I can't seem
to tell you goodbye
yeah, I wonder why
I'm no angel
with my selfish pride
but I love you more every day.

Love is an anger
that builds up inside,
as the tears
of frustration
roll down on my face
why does love always have to turn
out this way.
I don't want to 
fight again tonight
about the little things please baby,
I just want to 
find my way
back to love
and I'll meet
you there, baby.

And I wonder why 
we hold on
with tears in our eyes,
and I wonder why
we have to break down to just
make things right.
And I wonder why
I can't seem
to tell you goodbye
yeah, I wonder why
I'm no angel
with my selfish pride
but I love you more every day.
