Baby I had girls before
But no one ever hurt me more
That you, woman, can't you see
I've gotta have you back again
I just want to be your man
I hope you will understand

Baby don't you get me wrong
'Cause I regret the things I've done to you
I'll never lie again
How can I just make you know
I never really meant to go
I hope you will understand

Chorus:
Baby, when I think of you sometimes
I hope you will come back again sometimes
I just wanna be with you, girl I miss your love
It took some time to realize, it's you
I'm dreaming of

Chorus: ...

Well, it seems that we're together now
But I've got my doubts somehow
Ooh babe, when I read your mind

Yes, sometimes I don't really know
Will I stay or will I go
But this time my love for you is blind

Chorus: ...
