Little sleepy boy
do you know what time it is ?
Well the hour of your bedtime's
long been past
and though I know you're fighting it
I can tell when you rub your eyes
you're fading fast
fading fast.

Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
roll across the skies
and leave a spray of diamonds
in its wake
I long to see St. Judy's Comet
sparkle in your eyes
when you awake.

Little boy
won't you lay your body down
little boy
won't you close your weary eyes
ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies.

Well I sang it once
then I sang it twice
I'm going to sing it three times more
I'm going to stay 'til your resistance
is overcome
'cause if I can't sing my boy to sleep
well it makes your famous daddy
looks so dumb.

Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet
roll across the skies
and leave a spray of diamonds
in its wake
I long to see St. Judy's Comet
sparkle in your eyes
when you awake.

Little boy, little boy
won't you lay your body down
little boy, little boy
won't you close your weary eyes
ain't nothing flashing.

Little sleepy boy
do you know what time it is ?
Well the hour of your bedtime's
long been past
though I know you're fighting it
I can tell when you rub your eyes
that you're fading fast.
