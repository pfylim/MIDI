Hey little girl is your daddy home
did he go away and leave you all alone
I got a bad desire
I'm on fire
tell me now baby is he good to you
can do to you the things that I do
I can take you higher
I'm on fire
Sometimes it's like, someone took a knife
baby edgy and dull and cut a six-inch
valley through the middle of my soul
at night I wake up with the sheets
soaking wet and a freight train running
through the middle of my head
only you can cool my desire
I'm on fire.
