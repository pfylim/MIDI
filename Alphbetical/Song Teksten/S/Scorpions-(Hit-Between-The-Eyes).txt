Titel:        HIT BETWEEN THE EYES

Interpret:    SCORPIONS

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Late at night when you're all alone
take a ride to then danger zone
if someone wants to cut you down to size
you never argue with a loaded .45.

Just when you've had enough
it's really getting tough.

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
can't you see I'm much too young to die.

You can feel the tension in the street 
there's no escape, getting closer to the heat
you play with fire, get your fingers burned
it's too late, past the point of no return.

Just when you've had enough
it's really getting tough.

I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
someone get me out of here alive
I'm ready for that hit between the eyes
can't you see I'm much too young to die.
