I hear only what I want to hear,
but I have to believe in something,
have to believe just onething.
I say, Father washington, you're all mixed up,
collecting sinners in an old tin cup.
Who'll spare a listen for a restless fool;
there's something missing when I lead your rule.

Well hey there, you tell me you're a holy man,
but although I am just a beginner,
I don't see you as a winner.
I say, Sister Robinson, you're all washed up,
collecting teardrops in a  paper cup.
If you could tell you what you need to know,
if I could help you to get on with the show.

But rather than a reason, there's a smog in
my head, makes me feel what you said just wasn't true.
So what am I to do ?
Well, what is he to do ?
Oh, what is there to do ?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Maybe, well ,tell me what I'm living for,
'cause I feel like I'm tossed in the middle;
have you a son to deliver ?
I say, Father Washington, you're all mixed up, 
collecting sinners in an old tin cup.
You tell the children what they need to know,
but will they listen when it's time to go ?
Oh, Sister Robinson, you're all washed up,
collecting teardrops in a paper cup.
Can someone tell me what I need to know;
Can someone help me to get on with the show ?
