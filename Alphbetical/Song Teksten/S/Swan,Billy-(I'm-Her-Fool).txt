Singer : BILLY SWAN 
Title  : I'M HER FOOL

She tells me all the time that she loves me
She even poured the wine of the same
She taught me, like my first teacher to love
And I love to sing
And I love to go to school
I like to shoot pool
And I can't be your fool
'Cause I'm her fool

Refrain:
I'm her fool in the evening
And I'm her fool when it's dawn
I guess I'd be on her side
Even if her side were wrong

I run like a dog when she calls me
'Cause she pets me when I bury my bone
I stay overnight with her sometime
But I don't stay over long
'Cause I got to go to school
And I love to shoot pool
And I can't be your fool
'Cause I'm her fool

Refrain: ...

My papa said, you made a mistake
But my mama said, the girl she's alright
Well, I've come to my own decision
And I'm gonna be with her tonight
And I love to go to school
I like to shoot pool
And I can't be your fool
'Cause I'm her fool

Refrain: ...
