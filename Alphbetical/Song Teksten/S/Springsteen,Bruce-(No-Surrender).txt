We busted out of class had to get away
from those fools
we learned more from a three minute
record than we ever learned in school
tonight I hear the neighborhood drummer sound
I can feel my heart begin to pound
you say you're tired and you just want to
close your eyes and follow your dreams down.

We made a promise we swore we'd always remember
no retreat no surrender
like soldiers in the winter's night with
a vow to defend, no retreat no surrender.

Now young faces grow sad and old
and hearts of fire grow cold, we swore blood
brothers against the wind, I'm ready to
grow young again and hear your sister's
voice calling us home across the open yards
well maybe we could cut someplace of
our own with these drums and these guitars.

Blood brothers in the stormy night with
a vow to defend, no retreat no surrender.

Now on the street tonight the lights grow
dim the walls of my room are closing in
there's a war outside still raging
you say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath peaceful skies in
my lover's bed with a wide open country
in my eyes and these romantic dreams in my head.
give me a look like I'm way out of bounds,
you let out one of your bored sighs.
