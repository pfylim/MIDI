Singer : DONNA SUMMER 
Title  : LOVE TO LOVE YOU

Ooh love to love you baby (6x)

When you're laying so close to me
There's no place I'd rather you be then with me

Ooh love to love you baby (3x)

Do it to me again and again
You put me in such an awful spin, in a spin

Ooh love to love you baby (3x)

Lay your head down real close to me
Sooth my mind and set me free, set me free

Ooh love to love you baby (3x)
