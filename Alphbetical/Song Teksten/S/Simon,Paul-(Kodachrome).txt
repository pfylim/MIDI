When I think back
on all the crap I learned in high school
it's a wonder
I can think at all
and though my lack of education
hasn't hurt me none
I can read the writing on the wall.

Kodachrome
they give us those nice bright colors
they give us the greens of summers
makes you think all the world's
a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
so mama don't take my Kodachrome away.

If you took all the girls I knew
when I was single
and brought them all together
for one night
I know they'd never match
my sweet imagination
everything looks worse
in black and white.

Kodachrome
they give us those nice bright colors
they give us the greens of summers
makes you think all the world's
a sunny day
I got a Nikon camera
I love to take a photograph
so mama don't take my Kodachrome away.
