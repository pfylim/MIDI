DONNA SUMMER - THERE GOES MY BABY

There goes my baby
Movin' on down the line
Wonderin' where, wonderin' where
Wonderin' where he is bound
I broke his heart
And made him cry
Now I'm alone so all alone
What can I do?
What can I do?
There goes my baby (there he goes))
There goes my baby (2x)

Yes I wanna know
Did he love me
Did he really love me
Was he just playing me for a fool
I wonder why he was gonna tell her
That I love him
And that I need him beside my side
To be my guide
I wanna know where is my baby
Where is my baby

(There he goes) Yes I wanna know
Did he left me
Why did he leave me
So all alone
So all alone
I want my baby
I need my baby yes
