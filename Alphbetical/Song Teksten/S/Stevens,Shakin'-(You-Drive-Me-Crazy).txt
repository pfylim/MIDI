You know baby when you're in my arms
I can feel your loving magic charms,
you drive me crazy,
you drive me crazy.

And when I'm looking in these big blue eyes,
I start a' floating round in paradise,
you drive me crazy,
you drive me crazy.

Heaven must have sent you down,
down for you to give me a thrill,
ev'ry time you touch me,
ev'ry time you hold me,
my heart starts speeding like a train on a track.
I love you baby and it's plain to see,
I love you honey, it was meant to be,
you drive me crazy,
you drive me crazy, oh !

And when I'm looking in these big blue eyes,
I start a' floating round in paradise,
you drive me crazy,
you drive me crazy, oh !
