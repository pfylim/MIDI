  6. INSIDE - STILTSKIN
  
  SWING LOW
  IN A DARK GLASS HOUR
  YOU TURN AND COWER
  SEE IT TURN TO DUST
  MOVE ON A STONE DARK NIGHT
  WE TAKE TO FLIGHT
  SNOWFALL TURNS TO RUST
  
  SEAM IN A FUSING MINE
  LIKE A NURSING RHYME
  FAT MAN START TO FALL
  LONG YEAR IN A HOSTILE PLACE
  I HEAR YOUR FACE START TO CALL
  
  AND IF YOU THINK
  THAT I'VE BEEN LOSING MY WAY
  THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SLIGHTLY BLINDED
  AND IF YOU THINK
  THAT I DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE
  THAT'S BECAUSE
  I'M BROKEN MINDED
  DON'T KEEP IT...
  INSIDE
  IF YOU BELIEVE IT
  DON'T KEEP IT ALL INSIDE
  
  STRONG WORDS
  IN A GANGES SKY
  I HAVE TO LIE
  SHADOWS MOVE IN PARIS
  RING OUT FROM A BRUISED POSTCARD
  IN THE SHOOTING YARD
  LOOKING THROUGH THE TEARS
  OUT OF THE BLACK SLATE TIME
  WE MOVE IN LINE
  BUT NEVER REACH AN END
  FALL IN A LONG STRAY TOWN
  AS THE ICE COMES ROUND
  RIVER STARTS TO BEND
  
  AND IF YOU THINK
  THAT I'VE BEEN LOSING MY WAY
  THAT'S BECAUSE I'M SLIGHTLY BLINDED
  AND IF YOU THINK
  THAT I DON'T MAKE TOO MUCH SENSE
  THAT'S BECAUSE
  I'M BROKEN MINDED
  DON'T KEEP IT...
  INSIDE
  IF YOU BELIEVE IT
  DON'T KEEP IT ALL INSIDE
