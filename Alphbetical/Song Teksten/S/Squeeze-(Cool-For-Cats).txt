Title  : COOL FOR CATS

(Words & music: G. Tilbrook/C. Difford)

The indians sending signals from the rocks above the pass
The cowboys take position in the bushes and the grass
The squaw is with the Corp'ral, she's tied against the tree
She doesn't mind the language, it's the beating she don't need
She lets loose all the horses when the Corp'ral is asleep
And he wakes to find the fire's dead and arrows in his hats
And Davy Crockett rides around and says
It's cool for cats, it's cool for cats

The Sweeney's doin' ninety 'cos they've got the word to go
They set a gang of villains in shed up at Heathrow
They're counting out the fivers when the handcuffs lock again
In and out of Wandsworth with the numbers on their names
It's funny how there missus' always looks the bleeding same
And meanwhile at the station there's a couple of likely lads
Who swear like how's your father and they're very
Cool for cats, they're cool for cats

So change the mood a little, I've been buzzing down the pub
I'm seeing my reflection, I'm looking slightly rough
I fancy, this, I fancy that, I wanna be so flash
I give a little muscle and I spend a little cash
But all I get is bitter and a nasty little rash
And by the time I'm sober I've forgotten what I've had
And ev'rybody tells me that it's
Cool for cats, cool for cats

Shake up at the disco and I think I've got a pull
I ask her lots of questions and she hangs on to the wall
I kiss her for the first time and then I take her home
I'm invited in for coffee and I give the dog a bone
She likes to go to discos but she's never on her own
I said I'll see you later and I give her some old chat
But it's not like that on the T.V. when it's
Cool for cats, it's cool for cats
