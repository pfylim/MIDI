1. ASPECT OF LOVE (Love Changes Everything) - STARLIGHT MUSICAL EXPRESS

Love, love changes everything 
Hands and faces, perfumed sky
Love, love changes everything
How you're living, how you die
Love can make the summer fly
All the nights seem like a lifetime
Yes, love, love changes everything
Now I tremble at your knee
Nothing in the world will ever be the same
Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, words mean more
Love, love changes everything
Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever
Yes love, love changes everything
Brings you glory, brings you sane
Nothing in the world will ever be the same
All into the world we go
Planning futures, shaping years
Love, burst through and suddenly
All our wisdom disappears
Love makes fool of evryone
All the rules we make are broken
Yes love, love changes everyone
Leave a parade in its play
Love will never let you ever feel the same
Love will never let you ever feel the same
