Interpret:              THE SCORPIONS



Alas, my love you do me wrong to cast me
off discourteously, and I have loved
you so long delighting in your company.
Greensleeves was all all my joy,
Greensleeves was my delight,
Greensleeves was my heart of gold, and who
but you has Greensleeves ?

If you intend thus to disdain.
It does the more enrapture me,
and even so, I still remain
a lover in captivity.

Alas, my love, that you should own
a heart of wanton vanity,
so must I mediate alone
upon your insincerity.

Ah, Greensleeves, now farewell, adieu,
to God I pray to prosper thee,
for I am still your lover true,
come once again and love me !
