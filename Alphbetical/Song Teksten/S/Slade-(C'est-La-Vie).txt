  Title   : (AND NOW-THE WALTZ)C'EST LA VIE
  Written : By Noddy Holder/Jim Lea  

  He will never be free yeh
  He'll always want you
  He'll always need you

  We lay there
  Your long hair was warm
  The last night together
  We made love until dawn

  My nights on
  The town made your cry
  Let's make love one more time
  Before I say goodbye

  C'est la vie
  Ooh cherie
  C'est la vie

  Another time another place
  We'll be together again
  Another time another place
  We'll start all over again

  We talked of
  The fun ooh we'd had
  Remembering the good times
  We remembered the bad

  My two timing
  Ways made you low
  Let's make love one more time
  Before I have to go

  C'est la vie
  Ooh cherie
  C'est la vie

  He will never be free yeh
  He'll always want you
  He'll always need you

  Another time another place
  We''ll be together again
  Another time another place
  We'll start all over again

  C'est la vie
  Ooh cherie
  C'est la vie
  Ooh cherie
  C'est la vie

  He will never be free yeh
  He'll always want you
  He'll always need you
  He'll always want you
