FEARGAL SHARKEY - YOU LITTLE THIEF

You little thief, you let me love you
You saw me st-stumbling, you watched me fall
You left me broken, shattered and bleeding
But there's no hard feelings, there's no feelings at all

You little thief, you little savage
You little beauty, you little whore
You've taken everything, I had to believe in
Now there's nothing worth believing at all

So tell me
How does it feel to make a grown man wanna die
Does it make you uneasy, does it ever cross your mind

You little dream, you little nightmare
You little nothing, you little girl
You left me broken, shattered and bleeding
But there's no hard feelings, there's no feelings at all

There's no hard feelings
There's no hard feelings
There's no hard feelings
There's no feelings at all

'Cause babe when I needed you,
You watched me stumble
You watched me fall
