Title  : In Private
Singer : Dusty Springfield


Take your time and tell me
Why you lied
I realise
That we've been
Found out this time
We should stand together
If we can
Well, what you've planned
Proves there's a difference
Between

What you're gonna say
In private
You still want my love
We're in this toghether
What you gonna do
In public
Say you never were in love
That you can remember

So discreet
I never tried to meet
Your friends or interfere

I took a backseat
Between
What you're gonna say
In private
You still want my love
We're in this together
What you gonna do
In public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember

What you gonna say hey hey
When you run back to your wife
I guess it's just the story
Of my life
What you gonna 
So take your time
And tell me
Why did you lie
Oh I may publicize (no)
That there's a difference
between..
