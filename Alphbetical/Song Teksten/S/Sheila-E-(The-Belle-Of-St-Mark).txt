SHEILA E - THE BELLE OF ST.MARK

The Belle of St. Mark was a fair but a passionate creature
Ebony hair and eyes of deep blue green
Bell of St. Mark wore clothes that belonged to his father
Even though he was only a mere seventeen

Refrain:
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
With the Belle of St. Mark
It tears me apart whenever I hear him cry
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
With the Belle of St. Mark
If he doesn't love me I think I'll probably die

You can tell from expressions that he makes public
That he suffers from a deadly broken heart
He smiles as he feeds the afternoon pigeons
But he cries as he walks the night streets of St. Mark

The Belle of St. Mark he don't talk to strangers
He's so mysterious his erotic persuasion provokes me
like no other man
The fire I have for him is undoubtably serious
I must make him see that he needs love to forget
And if anyone can help him I can

His Paris hair it blows in the warm Parisian air
It blows whenever his Paris hair is there
The woman who hurt him surely must have trouble sleeping
'Cause the Belle of St. Mark is a beauty extra ordinaire
Oh I'm in love
