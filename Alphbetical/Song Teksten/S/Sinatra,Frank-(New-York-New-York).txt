Title  : NEW YORK, NEW YORK

(Words & music: John Kander/Fred Ebb)

Start spreadin' the news
I'm leaving today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York

These vagabond shoes
Are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York

I wanna wake up in the city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Top of the heap

These little town blues
Are melting away
I'll make a brand new start of it
In old New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it everywhere
It's up to you, New York, New York

New York, New York

I wanna wake up in the city
That doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill
Head of the list, cream of the top
Of the top of the list
