STYLE COUNCIL - HAVE YOU EVER HAD IT BLUE

Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do

Have you ever chased the night
That sailed in front of you
On a boat that's bound for hope
But left you in the queue
With the shouting, waving, taunting
Flaunting friends as crew
Telling you that every lie
You ever heard was true
Have you stood upon that dock
Have you ever had it blue
Ooh

Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do
Doot do do doot do do do do do

Have you ever woke to find
The morning didn't come
Undelivered with the papers
Stolen by someone
Found the milkman bound and gagged
And the shackles round the sun
And the holder of the keys
Turns out to be the one
The girl you had your heart set on
Have you ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Oooh

(instrumental sax solo)                                     

Have you ever watched the day
Passing by your door
Powerless to change its course
Your feet fixed to the floor
When all the people you thought you knew
Are changing more and more
Even the girl you thought would see
Seems only to ignore
The only love worth fighting for
Have you ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Oooh

Ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
Have you ever had it blue
