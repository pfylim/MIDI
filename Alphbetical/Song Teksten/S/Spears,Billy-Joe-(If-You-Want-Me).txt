
12. IF YOU WANT ME - BILLIE JOE SPEARS

If you think I gonna just bite my tongue
Held by the ties that mind
While youre running free.
If you think I don긊 know,
If you think it doesn긊 show,
Well, you better think again,
If you want me.

Baby, I don긊 care for a love that I have to share
With somebody else somewhere,
Youre running to see.
I don긊 want part of you,
I want all the heart of you
And that급 the way it급 got to be,
If you want me.

And so it급 up to you just where were going.
It급 either all the way or not at all.
귞ause I can긊 give myself completely knowing
Someone else is answering when you feel the need to call.

So my friend we can just let it end,
Or go back and start again,
What급 it gonna be?
Remember what I say.
It급 got to be all the way.
There can긊 be no in between 
If you want me.
And that급 the way it급 got to be,
If you want me.
