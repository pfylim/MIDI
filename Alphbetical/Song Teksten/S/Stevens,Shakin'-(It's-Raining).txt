It's raining so hard looks like it's goin' to rain all night
and this is the time I love to be holding you tight.
But I guess I'll have to accept the fact that you're not here.
I wish the night would hurry up and end my dear.
It's raining so hard. It's really coming down.
Sittin' by my window watching the rain fall to the ground.

This is the time I love to be holding you tight.
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight.
It's raining so hard. It brings back memories
of the time when you were here with me.
Counting every drop, about to blow my top.
I wish the rain would hurry up and stop.

I got the blues so bad I can hardly catch my breath.
The harder it rains; the worse it gets.
This is the time I love to be holding you tight.

I guess I'll just go crazy tonight.
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight.
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight.
I guess I'll just go crazy tonight.
