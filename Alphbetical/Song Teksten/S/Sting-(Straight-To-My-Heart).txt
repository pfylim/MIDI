In a hundred years from now
they will attempt to hell us how
a scientific means to bliss will supercede the human kiss.
A subatomic chain will may be galvanize the brain,
or a biochemic trance will eliminate romance.
Why ever should we care when there are
arrows in the air
formed by lovers' ancient art that go straight to my heart,
straight to my heart.

A future sugarcoated pill would give our lovers time to kill.
I think they're working far too much
for the redundancy of touch.
But what will make me yours
are a million deadly spores
formed by lovers' ancient art that go straight to my heart,
straight to my heart.

Come into my door;
be the light of my life.
Come into my door;
you'll never have to sweep the floor.
Come into my door;
be the light of my life.
Come into my door;
come and be my wife.

I'll be true to no one but you.
If it's a future world we fear,
we have tomorrow's seed right here.
For you can hold them in your hand,
or let them fall into the sand.
But if our love is pure,
the only thing of which we're sure,
then you can play your part and fly
straight to my heart,
straight to my heart.

If I should seek immunity and love you with impunity,
then the only thing to do is for me to
pledge myself to you.
They only dealt one card,
so for me it is not hard.
You're the bright star in my chart,
you go straight to my heart,
straight to my heart.

Come into my door;
be the light of my life.
Come into my door;
you'll never have to sweep the floor.
Come into my door;
be the light of my life.
Come into my door;
come and be my wife.

I'll be true to no one but you.
Straight to my heart, straight to my heart,
straight to my heart, straight to my heart,
straight to my heart, straight to my heart.
