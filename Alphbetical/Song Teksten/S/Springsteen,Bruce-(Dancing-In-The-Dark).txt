BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN - DANCING IN THE DARK


I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I ain't nothing but tired
Man, I'm just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby I could use just a little help

Refrain:
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire with a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Message keeps getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving round the place
I check my look in the mirror
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere just living in
A dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

Refrain: ...

You sit around and getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laugh's on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up alright
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sittin' here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire 'round crying over
A broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying
About your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
