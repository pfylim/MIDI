Oh my heart is spinning like a wheel
only she can see the way that I feel
eyes are holding right across the room
high explosion coming out of the blue
well here we go again
living in  aworld that others cannot share
yea here we go again
we are moving from a spark to a flame

I am high on emotion, high again
high on emotion, your love will find the way

Oh my heart is burning like a fire
closer now and she is breathing desire
take my hand and give it all your light
take command I am your rhythm tonight
well here we go again
living in  aworld that others cannot share
yea here we go again
we are moving from a spark to a flame

I am high on emotion, high again
high on emotion, your love will find the way

I am high on emotion, high again
high on emotion, your love will find the way

I am high on emotion, high again
high on emotion, your love will find the way.....
