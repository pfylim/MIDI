We wanna get a statement for Jesus' sake
it's like a talking to the wall
he's incommunicado
no comment to make
he's saying nothing at all.

Yeah but in the communique
you know he's gonna come clean
think what he say
say what he means
maybe on a monday he got something to say.

Maybe he could talk about the tricks of the trade
maybe he can talk about himself
maybe he could talk about the money that he made
maybe he be saying something else

But in the communique
you know he's gonna come clean
think what he say
say what he means
maybe on a monday he got something to say.

Well now the rumours are flying
speculation rife
they say that he's been trying someone else's wife
somebody at the airport
somebody on the phone
says he's at the station and he's coming home alone
then we get the story
the serious piece
and a photograph a taken in the hall
and you don't have to worry with the previous release
right now he's saying nothing at all

But in the communique
you know he's gonna come clean
think what he say
say what he means
maybe on a monday he got something to say.
