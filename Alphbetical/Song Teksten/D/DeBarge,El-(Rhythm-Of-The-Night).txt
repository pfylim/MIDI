DeBARGE - RHYTHM OF THE NIGHT

When it feels like the world is on your shoulders
And all of the madness has got you going crazy
It's time to get out, step out into the street
Where all of the action is right there at your feet

Well I know a place where we can dance all night away
Underneath the electric stars
Just come with me and we can shake your blues right away
You'll be doing fine the music starts

Refrain:
Oh to the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Oh the rhythm of the night
Oh oh oh yeah

Look out on the street now, the party's just beginning
The music's playing, a celebration's starting
Under the street lights the scene is being set
A night for romance, a night you won't forget

So come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long

Refrain: ...

Come join the fun
This ain't no time to be staying home
Ooh there's too much going on
Tonight is gonna be a night like you've never known
We're gonna have a good time the whole night long

Oh to the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind
You can leave them all behind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Dance until the morning light
Forget about the worries on your mind

To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
To the beat of the rhythm of the night
Forget about the worries on your mind
