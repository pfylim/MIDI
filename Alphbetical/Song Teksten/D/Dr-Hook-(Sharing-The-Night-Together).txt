Title  : SHARING THE NIGHT TOGETHER

(Words & music: Aldridge/Struzick)

You're lookin' kind of lonely girl
Would you like someone new to talk to?
Oh yeah, oh right
I'm feelin' kind of lonely too
If you don't mind, can I sit down here beside you
Oh yeah, oh right
If I seem to come on too strong
I hope that you will understand
I say these things
'Cause I liked to know if you're as lonely as I am
And if you'd mind
Sharing the night together ooh yeah
Sharing the night together ooh yeah
Sharing the night

We can bring in the morning girl
If you wanna go that far
And if tomorrow finds us together
Right here the way we are
Would you mind
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
Sharing the night

Would you like to dance with me
And hold me you know I wanna be holding you
Oh yeah, oh right
'Cause I'm feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes that you're likin' it
I'm likin' it too
Oh yeah, oh right
Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go
Where we can be alone together
And turn the lights down low
And start
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
Sharing the night together, ooh yeah
