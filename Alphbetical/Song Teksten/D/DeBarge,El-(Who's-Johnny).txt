EL DEBARGE - WHO'S JOHNNY


There she goes and knows
I'm dying when she says
Who's Johnny?
Games with names
That girl is playing
All she says is
Who's Johnny?
I try to understand
Because I'm people too
And playing games
Is part of human nature
My heart's in overdrive
It's great to be alive

REFRAIN:
Who's Johnny? she said
And smiled in her special way
Johnny, she said, You know I love you
Who's Johnny? she said
And tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
Still pretending
Who's Johnny? Who's Johnny?
Who's Johnny? Who's Johnny?
Who's Johnny? she said

She makes sure
I see her teasing
Hear her say
Who's Johnny?
There's no way to take this easy
Hear her say
Who's Johnny?
I really couldn't help
But fall in love with her
Her being there
Has made my life worth living
I knew it from the start
That I would lose my heart

REFRAIN: ...

And I tried to look the other way
Her eyes gave her away
Girls like her are very special girls
Girls like her don't rest
Until you too are a believer
'Til you too have caught their fever
