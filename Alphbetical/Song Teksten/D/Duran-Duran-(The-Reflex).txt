DURAN DURAN - THE REFLEX

The the the the
The reflex, the reflex
The the the the
The reflex, the reflex
Fle-fle-fle-fle-flex

You gone too far this time
But I'm dancing on the valentine
I tell you somebody's fooling around
With my chances on the danger-line
I'll cross that bridge when I find it
Another day to make my stand oh oh
High time is no time for deciding
If I should find a helping hand oh oh

Why-yi-yi-yi-yi don't you use it
Try-yi-yi-yi-yi not to bruise it
Why-yi-yi-yi-yi don't you use it
Try-yi-yi-yi-yi not to bruise it
Buy-yi-yi-yi-yi time don't lose it

Refrain:
The reflex is an only child, he's waiting in the park
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
And watching over lucky clover, isn't that bizarre
Every little thing the reflex does leaves you
Answered with a question mark

I'm on a ride and want to get off
But they won't slow down the roundabout
I sold the Renoir and the tv-set
Don't wanna be around when this gets out, so

Why-yi-yi-yi-yi don't you use it
Try-yi-yi-yi-yi not to bruise it
Buy-yi-yi-yi-yi time don't lose it

Why-yi-yi-yi-yi, why-yi-yi-yi-yi (yeah)(2x)
Why-yi-yi-yi-yi don't you use it

Refrain: ...

So why-yi-yi-yi-yi don't you use it
Try-yi-yi-yi-yi not to bruise it
Buy-yi-yi-yi-yi time don't lose it

Refrain: ...

Ah, the reflex what a game, he's hiding all the cards
The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark
