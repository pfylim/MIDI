Singer : DIZZY MAN'S BAND 
Title  : THE OPERA

And if you wanna have some show
I know where you have to go
In every town's a concert hall
Where we're gonna have a ball
It seems a bit official style
But we can join it for a while
So let's go to the opera
And listen to that silly crowd
Where the baritones are singin' lalalala
And the fatty sopranos screaming lalalala

See the hero on the stage
See him dying with much grace
And Romeo and Julia
Makin' love at the opera
So if you wanna have some fun
I know where it can be done
So let's go to the opera
And laugh about the silly crowd
Where the baritones are singin' lalalala
And the fatty sopranos screaming lalalala

The opera, the opera, we all like the opera (10x)
