There's a party
Here we start it
There's a party
This a party's song that makes the party goin' on

There's a party 
Don't ya know today there is a party
Open up your heart we're gonna start it
Welcome at the beach this is for you, just for you

The way that I live 
has a big big price,
Sometimes I'm nice, 
Sometimes I'm ice, cold
And then it's show
I started to dance so don't you know
I'm getting down to the beat
Like I did in the past
Concentrate myself and I'm doin' it fast
Here is the question: are you ready to dance
When you hear my rap rhymes
You would take your chance.

There's a party 
Don't ya know today there is a party
Open up your heart we're gonna start it
Welcome at the beach this is for you, just for you

There's a party
Here we start it
There's a party
This a party's song that makes the party goin' on

You think I'm a star
I tell you're wrong
I just make my music and that makes me strong
For so many people bein' a star is a dream
When you see yourself acting, then it's only a dream
You see your brother dance like being a clown
Or bein' a king, I mean, a king without a crown
So let me tell you just one more thing
You'd better do whatcha want
And start this thing

There's a party 
Don't ya know today there is a party
Open up your heart we're gonna start it
Welcome at the beach this is for you, just for you
