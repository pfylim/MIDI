SULTANS OF SWING - DIRE STRAITS

Intro (8 Takte instrumental, Guitar):

Vers 1:
You get a shiver in the dark it's raining in the park  in meantime 
South of the river you stop and you hold  everything 
A band is blowing "Dixie", double four time 
You feel allright when you hear the music ring.

Vers 2:
You step inside  but you don't see too many faces 
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competitions in other faces
But the horns  blowing that sound.

1.Refrain:
Way on down south, way on down south  London town! 

Bridge (8 Takte instrumental, Guitar):

Vers 3:
Check out, Guitar George, he knows all the chords 
Mind he's strictly rhythm  he doesn't want to make it cry or sing 
And an old guitar is all  he can afford
When he gets up under the lights  to play his thing.

Vers 4:
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job, he's doing allright
He can play the honky tonk  like anything
Saving it up for Friday night.

2.Refrain:
With the "Sultans", with the "Sultans Of Swing"!

Bridge (8 Takte instrumental, Guitar):

Vers 5:
And a crowd of young boys they're fooling around in the corner 
Drunk and dressed in their baggies and their best brown suites
They don't give a damn  about any  trumpet  playing band
It ain't what they call "Rock & Roll".

3.Refrain:
And the "Sultans", and the "Sultans" they played "Creole"!

Bridge (8 Takte instrumental, Guitar): 

Guitarsolo (28 Takte über Harmonien Vers, Refrain u. Bridge):

Vers 6:
And then the man he steps right up to the microfone
And says at last  just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight - thank you - now it's time - to go home!"
And he makes it fast one more thing.

4.Refrain:
We are the "Sultans", we are the "Sultans Of Swing"!

Bridge (8 Takte instrumental, Guitar):

Guitarsolo (32 Takte, dabei am Ende ausklingen lassen):

Fade out
