Smiley where (are) you goin'
Na now what's new
Destination somewhere in L.A.
Well I tell you it's your lucky day today
Why not takin' me there 
Get on in and sing my song
Showbizz people from now on

Hollywood now here we come oh oh oh
Hi ho Hollywood
Well the job is done
Ain't you got some time for me
Singin' my new song
Do you see what I see
You and I
Trav'ling through the whole U.S.A.
Now close your eyes and let it drift away
We're gonna wipe the others all away
Come let's try and practice some
On the road we can have some fun
Hollywood now here we come
Oh oh oh
