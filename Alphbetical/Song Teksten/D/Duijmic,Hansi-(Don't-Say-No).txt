In my dreams it is you
Who is mine, who is true
In my dreams I am right
To be with you every night

And I'll try to hold your hand
Then we'll touch wonderland
Babe, maybe, then you'll see
That you've been made for me

You don't say yes, you don't say no,
You drive me crazy, pretty baby, don't you know
You don't say yes, you don't say no,
Try to find a way to go !
Let us live for our loving,
Please say yes, but don't say no !

Your eyes are bright like the sun,
You are all sweet things rolled in one.
I loved you from the very, very start,
so please don't break my heart

You don't say yes, you don't say no,
You drive me crazy, pretty baby, don't you know
You don't say yes, you don't say no,
Try to find a way to go !
Let us live for our loving,
Please say yes, but don't say no !

Solo:

You don't say yes, you don't say no,
You drive me crazy, pretty baby, don't you know
You don't say yes, you don't say no,
Try to find a way to go !
Let us live for our loving,
Please say yes, but don't say no !

Ende Solo

2 x  Refrain

You don't say yes, you don't say no,
You drive me crazy, pretty baby, don't you know
You don't say yes, you don't say no,
Try to find a way to go !
Let us live for our loving,
Please say yes, but don't say no !
