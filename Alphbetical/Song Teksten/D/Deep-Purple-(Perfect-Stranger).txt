1)     Can you remember, remember my name
       As I flow through your life
       A thousand oceans I have flown
       Oh - and cold - cold spirits of ice
       All my life
       I am the echoe of your past

2)     I am returning the echoe of a point of time
       And distance faces shine
       A tousand warriors I have known
       Oh - and laughing - as the spirits appear
       All my life
       Iam the shadow of your day

Ref)   And if you hear me talking on the wind
       You've got to understand, we must remain
       Perfect strangers

Bridge)  I know I must remain the silent well of sorrow

3)     A strand of silver, hanging through the sky
       Touching more than you see
       The voice of ages in your mind,
       Oh - is aching - with the dead of the night
       Oh - precious life
       Your tears are lost in falling rain

Ref    And if you hear me talking on the wind
       You've got to understand, we must remain
       Perfect strangers
