Hello Afrika - tell me how you're doin'!
Hello motherland - tell me how you're doin'!
Hello Afrika - tell me how you're doin'!
Hello motherland - tell me how you're doin'!

Hello Nigeria! that's my motherland
coming to sweden now - causin' a hysteria
Takes a long time to travel the globe
So why be shy? Why be humble?
I just came straight out the jungle
You can't compete with me
Cause you know I got the rhythm
I did it before and I'll do it again
So listen watcha say
Yeah, hear my point of view
Not everyone can do this
No in fact only a few
Sophisticated, hardcreated
That's who I am
And you know I've been waiting
So start pumping - make some noise!
--------------------------------------------------------
The Mandinka Tribe, The House Tribe
The Fulani Tribe, The Booya Tribe
The Zulu Tribe
Mi no live in a house
Mi live in a tree
Elictrcity can give you a schock
Mi no smoke no cig
Mi no lake no coke
All mi take is a glass of juice
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm calling on the big guys from the pyramid top
To join bits and peaces of our fatherland - Afrika
Cause without boundries we can move the mountains
Drop your personal individual ambitions
Chase the devil off and purify our fatherland
Afrikan people, crawl from your vultures, stand affirm
Cause you are the Aurra of mankind
You are the dreams, you are the hope
You are the future, you are the past
You are the grandfather of civilisation
This is why ANC wants old dogs to sit
--------------------------------------------------------
The impossible just takes a little longer
Out of this world and into another world
The earth is spinning round and there's so
Much to discover
The afrikan man seems to be everywhere
If there are poeople in the world who knows
That right is never wrong
Stop the fire burning in my home
--------------------------------------------------------
Martin Luther King, Mandela - you had a dream
Self evidence and a quality for men
Afrika for me and Afrika for you De Klerk
It doesn't really matter
Whether a cat is black or white
What really matter is to catch the mouse
I'd rather do it in an afrikan way
Hello Afrika tell me how you're doin'
