        Blueberry Hill


I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you .
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true .

The winds in the willow played
Love's sweet melody 
But all of those vows we made
Where never to be .

Tho' we're apart , you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill .

The winds ...

Tho' we're apart ...
