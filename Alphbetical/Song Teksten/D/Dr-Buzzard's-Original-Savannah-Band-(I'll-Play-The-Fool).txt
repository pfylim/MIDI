Singer : DR. BUZZARD'S ORIGINAL SAVANNAH BAND 
Title  : I'LL PLAY THE FOOL

(Words & music: August Darnell/Stony Browder Jr.)

I'll play the fool for you, oh girl
If that will get me over
And I'm gonna go to school again
Boy, for you
Just get my equivalency diploma

Chorus:
There's nothing, honey
That I won't do
When I meet a guy
Lovely as you
Ain't it funny
What a little love can do
Better than poison
Some what stronger than glue

I'll be a joke for you, oh girl
Make you smile when you're feeling blue
I'll grow a tail or two for you
Spend the rest of my days
Locked up in a zoo

Chorus: ...

When your body's close to mine
My baby, ooh
I get a feeling that's so divine
Ooh, say, blows my mind

Keep on dancin'
If the music really blows your mind
Keep on dancin'
If the music really blows your mind

I'll play the fool for you, oh girl
Buy you things that I cannot afford
And I'll let you be a fool for me
Honey, honey, hey
Fix all the holes 
And lock all the doors

Chorus: ...
