Title  : GOIN' BACK TO CHINA

(Words & music: Pim Koopman)

When I saw Annie she was head over heels
For a guy she had met in the streets
He'd told her she meant all the world to him
So there's no need in goin' back East

Annie, where in the world would your love be?
Annie, where in the world has he gone?

Chorus:
Hey Lee, what's the deal?
You're goin' back to China
Hey Lee, what's the deal?
Whatcha runnin' for?

Chorus: ...

I knew she'd cling to anybody at all
Isolation was part of the game
No French, no Dutch, had no connection at all
Till she found out she's part of the frame

Annie, where in the world would you love be?
Annie, where in the world has he gone?

Chorus: ...
