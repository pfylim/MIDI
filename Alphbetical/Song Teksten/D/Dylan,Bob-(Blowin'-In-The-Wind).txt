Title  : BLOWING IN THE WIND

(Words & music: Bob Dylan)

How many roads must a man walk down
Before we call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many years must a mountain exit
Before it is washed to the sea
How many years can some people exist
Before allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

How many times can a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one man have
before he can hear people cry
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer my friend is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
