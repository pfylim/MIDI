Ba ba ba ba (4x)
At the Hop

well you can rock it, you can roll it
Do the stop and even stroll it at the hop
When the records start spinning
Your two lips, when you're chickin' at the hop
Do the dance sensations that are sweepin' the nation at the hop

Let's go to the hop (2x)
Oh baby
C'mon let's go to the hop

Well you can swing it or you can groove it
Yoou can really start to move it at the hop
where the jacket is the smoothest and the music is the coolest
At the hop
All the cats and chicks can get their kicks at the hop
