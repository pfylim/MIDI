Singer : DIZZY MAN'S BAND 
Title  : MONY THE PHONEY

Mony the phoney, Mony the phoney
Mony Mony Mony

Yeah I love that Mony, even though all
the guys in the group say she's phoney
They don't like her, they don't dig her
I don't care she wears a wig
I don't mind her wooden legs
'Cause she's nice, she's fine,
she's good, she's mine
She's nice, she's fine, she's good, she's mine

Mony the phoney, fat as a pony
Toothless and mouldy, Mony Mony Mony Mony

Yeah they say she's phoney
That she's a bitch and ugly groupie
always in for a whoopy
They say I'm so stupid I'm a puppet on a string
Bbbbut she gives me joy, as I use her as a toy
'Cause she's nice, she's fine,
she's good, she's mine
