Title  : SAY IT AIN'T SO, JOE

(Words & music: Murray Head)

Chorus:
Say it ain't so, Joe please
Say it ain't so
That's not what I wanna hear Joe
Ain't got a right to know
Say it ain't so, Joe please
Say it ain't so

I'm sure they're telling us lies Joe
Please tell us it ain't so
They told us that our hero played his trumpet
He doesn't know how to go
We're clinging to his charm and determined smile
But the good old days have gone

The image and the empire may be falling apart
The money has gotten scarce
One man's word held the country together
But the truth is getting fierce

Say it ain't so, Joe please
Say it ain't so
We pinned our hopes on you Joe
And they're ruining our show

Babies don't you think we're gonna get burned
Oh babies don't you think we're gonna get burned
We're gonna get turned, we're gonna get learned
We're gonna get burned (5x)

Chorus: ...
