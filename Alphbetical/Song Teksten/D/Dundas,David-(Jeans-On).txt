3. JEANS ON - DAVID DUNDAS

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my Jeans
And I feel all right.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.

It`s the weekend 
And I know that you`re free
So pull on your Jeans
And come on out with me.
I need to have you near me.
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me.
I need to feel you close to me

Chorus
You and me will go motorbike riding
In the sun and the wind and the rain.
I got money in my pocket.
A tiger in my tank
And I`m king of the road again.

I meet ya in the usual place
I don`t need a thing
Such a pretty face.
And I need to have you near me.
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me.
I need to feel you close to me
I need to have you near me.
I need to feel you close to me

Chorus

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my Jeans
And I feel all right.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my Jeans
And I feel all right.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.

When I wake up
In the morning light
I pull on my Jeans
And I feel all right.
I pull my Blue Jeans on
I pull my old Blue Jeans on.
