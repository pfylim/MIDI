DOLLY DOTS - WHERE WERE YOU

When we had our little love affair
Can still recall the day
But where are you now, what is left of our love
You can't let it vanish this way
Where were you that day

Where were you, when I needed you
Don't be a pretender
Why don't you surrender
You know you get the best out of me
Where were you, when I needed you
Forget all the sad lines
Think of the good times
I know we can make it somehow
So where are you now

What is left of all the things you said
Of all the love and care you've showed me
Here I am and I'm just feeling bad
'Cause I don't know where I am going
Don't walk out on me this way
It's so easy, so tell me where were you that day

Where were you, when I needed you
Just try to remember
I'm not an amender
I want you just the way that you are
Where were you, when I needed you
So just give me a break
That is all that it takes
Try it 'cause I know you know how
But where are you now

What's the use of staying home alone
If I don't know if you're coming
Still I know we'd have a better time
If you would try instead of running
We can take down the wall we made
So come on let's not waste one more day

Where were you, when I needed you
Forget all the sad lines
Just think of the good times
I know we can make it somehow
So where are you now

I miss you, I miss you
please come back, come back
