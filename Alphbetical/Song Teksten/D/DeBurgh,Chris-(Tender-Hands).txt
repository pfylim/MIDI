Oh how, at the journey's end, I lie in the heat of the night
feeling the heartache, wondering why, I want a friend
I want a friend to lay down beside me
I want a friend , I want her now, someone who knows what I mean
when I say, that I need

Tender hands to hold me, I need tender hands tonight
will you lay them on my shoulders
will you lay them on my eyes
and I need tender hands to take me
all the way to paradise, and then, when it's over
I need tender hands to hold me through the night

Touch me with your velvet mouth, I will give all the love that I have
under the moonlight, reaching your heart
where are you now, where are you now, come out of the shadows
where are you now, I want you now
you know that I cannot be strong, and I need

Tender hands to hold me, I need tender hands tonight
will you lay them on my shoulders
will you lay them on my eyes,
and I need tender hands to take me
all the way to paradise, and then, when it's over
I need tender hands to hold me through the night

I am only a voice in a city of noise, can you hear me this time
I see the storm grow, there's a light in the desert tonight

And I need tender hands, give me tender hands
will you lay them on my shoulders, oh give me
tender hands to take me all the way to paradise
and then when it's over, I have tender hands
to hold you through the night, darling
my tender hands will hold you through the night

I want your tender hands, you have tender hands,
I want those tender hands, tender hands.....
