Title  : THE BOY FROM NEW YORK CITY

(Words & music: John Taylor)

Chorus:
Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo oo Kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City
Oo-ah, oo-ah, oo oo Kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City

He's kinda tall, he's really fine
Some day I hope to make him mine, all mine
And he's neat, and oh, so sweet
And just the way he looked at me
Just swept me off my feet
Oo, ee you oughta come and see
How he walks and how he talks

Chorus: ...

He's really down, and he's no clown
He has  the finest Penthouse I've ever seen in town
And he's cute in his mohair suit
And he keeps his pocket full of spending loot
Oo, ee you oughta come and see
His pretty bar and his brandnew car

Chorus: ...

Ev'ry time he says he loves me
Chills run down my spine
Ev'ry time he wants to kiss me
Oo, he makes me feel so fine, yeah
Oo-ah, oo-ah come on, Kitty
Tell us about the boy from New York City

He can dance and make romance
That's when I fell in love with just one glance
He was shot and so was I
And now I know we'll never ever say goodbye
Oo, ee you oughta come and see
He's the most from coast to coast

Chorus: ...
