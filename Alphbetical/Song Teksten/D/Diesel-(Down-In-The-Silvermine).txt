Title  : DOWN IN THE SILVERMINE

(Words en music: Boon/Vunderink)

Chorus:
Down in the silvermine
The dusk is playin' tricks on time
Days are long, but the work is fine
Down in the silvermine

Hear how the band is playing
Folks on the platform saying
Eye to the boy who's leaving home

Hurry, the whistle's blowing
Hanky, my tears are showing
Anchors away, I'm on my own

I'm heading eastward on the silver streak
Far from the girl I left behind
No time for tears 'n sorrow, I've got silver on my mind

Chorus:

Hi ho the weels are grinding
Strong arms and picks are winding
Straight down the mining-shaft we go

Lie low, the rocks they rumble
Into the dark we stumble
Risking our lives, because we know

Down there's a one-way fare to easy street
Grab all the silver we can find
Sell to the highest bidder
Head for the girl I left behind

Chorus: ...
