Title  : DADDY COOL

(Words & music: Frank Slay/Bob Crewe)

I saw a crazy chick a-runnin' down the street
I said: Hello, pretty baby, why the great big heat
She said: A-wow, what a square!
Don't ya dig this scene?
Daddy Cool's playin' his piano machine!
Well, Daddy Who?, Daddy Cool!
Daddy Who?, Daddy Cool!
Daddy Cool (8x)

She led me by the hand
Down to the railroad stand
And in a tinroofed honky tonk
Cool Daddy's sugar shack

The joint was dim and dull
Except for one spotlight
That shone down on two frantic hands
That rocked like dynamite, Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool

Hey hey hey, Cool Daddy Cool
Daddy Cool (4x)
Rock, rock, rock, rock
Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool
Da-ha-dy Cool, Daddy Cool
Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool
Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool
Da-ha-dy Cool, Daddy
