Title  : KUNG FU FIGHTING

Refrain:
Ev'rybody was Kung Fu fighting
Those cats were fast as lightning
In fact it was a little bit frightnin'
But they fought with expert timin'

There were funky China men
From funky China Town
They were chopping them up
They were chopping them down

It's an ancient Chinese art
And ev'rybody knew their part
From a feinting to a slip
And a kick from the hip

Refrain: ...

There was a funky Billy Chin
And a little Sammy Chung
He said, here comes the big boss
Let's get it on
He took a bow and made a stand
Started swayin' with the hand
A sudden motion made me skip
Now we're in to a brand new trip

Refrain: ...
