You can dance every dance
with the guy
who gave you the eye
let him hold you tight.

You can smile every smile
for the man
who held your hand
'neath the pale moonlight.

But don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be
oh darling save the last dance for me.

Yes I know
that the music's fine
like sparkling wine
go on and have your fun.

Laugh and sing
but while we're apart
don't give your heart 
to anyone.

And don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be
oh darling save the last dance for me.

Baby don't you know I love you so
can't you feel it when we touch
baby don't you know I'll never let you go
I need you oh so much.

You can dance
go on carry on
till the night is gone
and it's time to go
and if he asks
if you're all alone
and can he take you home
you must tell him no.

'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
and in whose arms you're gonna be
oh darling save the last dance for me.
so darling save the last dance for me.
