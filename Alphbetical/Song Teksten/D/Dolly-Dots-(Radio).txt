Singer : DOLLY DOTS
Title  : RADIO

(Words & music: R.A. Debois/P.Brewley)

Sing along, listen to the music
Day or night, you must have to choose it
You, you just have to turn it on

In the groove with my favourite D.J.
We can dance to the hits that he plays
You, you just have to turn him on

Chorus:
Radio, everybody listen to the radio
There you go, everybody's singing to the song they know
Radio, everybody listen to the radio
Where you go, you don't have to miss your favourite show

I like funk
I'm in love with disco
I like punk
Things that you are into
Oh, I could hear it all day long

With my friends drivin' on the highway
Listening to songs from then and today
Wish we could take you all along

In the car, kissing in the backseat
Music up, I can feel my heart beat
Oh, you're the guy who turns me on

Chorus: ...
