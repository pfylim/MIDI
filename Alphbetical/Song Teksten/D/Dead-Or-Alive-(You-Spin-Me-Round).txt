DEAD OR ALIVE - YOU SPIN ME ROUND (LIKE A RECORD)

If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number baby
All I know is that to me you look like you're lots
of fun
Open up your loving arms, I want some, want some
Well I, I set my sights on you (and no-one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now baby
All I know is that to me you look like you're having fun
Open up your loving arms watch out here I come

Refrain:
You spin me right round baby
Right round like a record baby
Right round, round, round
You spin me right round baby
Right round like a record baby
Right round, round, round

I, I, I, I, I got to be your friend now baby
And I, I, I,I would like to move in just a little closer
(Oh won't you move in just a little bit closer)
All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots
of fun
Open up your loving arms, watch out here I come

Refrain: ...

I want your love
I want your love
All I know is that to me, you look like you're lots
of fun
Open up your loving arms, watch out here I come
