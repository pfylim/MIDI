Title  : FINALLY HOME AGAIN

(Words & music: Rudy Bennett)

Honey of mine here I'm back again
I'm so glad to be back home again
After all those busy days
I'm gettin' tired but anyway
I'm home again
The place where I belong
Next to you

Honey of mine here I'm home again
Still my thoughts are hanging in the plane
And a place like Amsterdam
With the chasing crowd but anyhow
I'm home at last
The place where I belong next to you
You make me feel brand new
My paradise is you
My world is next to you

And with you, I find my rest
Only you, you are my last
Yes you can make me smile
When I'm with you again for a while

And with you, I find my rest
Only you, you are my last
Yes you can make me smile
When I'm with you again for a while

Honey of mine here I'm back again
I'm so glad to be back home again
After all those busy days
I'm getting tired but anyway
I'm home again
The place where I belong next to you

And with you, I find my rest
Only you, you are my last
Yes you can make me smile
When I'm with you again for a while
