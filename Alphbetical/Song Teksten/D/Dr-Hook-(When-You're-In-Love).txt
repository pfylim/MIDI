Title  : WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE

(Words & music: Haffkine/Stevens)

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it's hard
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
'Cause everybody wants her, everybody loves here
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch your friends
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, it never ends
You know that it's crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone

Maybe it's just an ego problem
The problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
'Cause everybody tempts her, everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
