Title  : YOU'RE MORE THAN A NUMBER

(Words & music: T. Macaulay/R. Greenaway)

Refrain:
You're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night date
All I had to take me was just one look
My heart began thumping
Babe you had it jumping
'Cause you're more than a number in my little red book
You're more than a one night stand
In case you get to think that you've been took
You're more than a number written in my little red book

Oh baby give us a chance
Don't let the small town rumors
End our first real romance
I'll admit I've loved a few
But there was never one like you
So darling don't believe the things they say

Refrain: ...

Oh baby you gave me a sign
I threw away the numbers of those old flames of mine
And now they've trying to put you wise
Knock me down in my girl's eyes
Oh, darling don't believe the things they say

Refrain: ...
