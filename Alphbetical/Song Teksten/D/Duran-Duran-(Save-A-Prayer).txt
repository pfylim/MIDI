DURAN DURAN - SAVE A PRAYER

You saw me standing by the corner of a main street
And the lights are flashing on your window sill
All alone ain't much fun so you're looking for the thrill
And you know just what it takes and where to go

Don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after
No don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after

Feel the breeze deep on the inside look you
down into the well
If you can you'll see the world in all his fire
Take a chance (like all dreamers can't find
another way)
You don't have to dream it all, just live a day

Don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after
No don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after
Save it till the morning after, save it till the
morning after

Pretty looking road I try to hold the rising floods
that dill my skin
Don't ask me why I'll keep my promise I'll melt the ice
And you wanted to dance so I asked you to dance
But fear is in your soul
Some people call it a one night stand, but we
call it a paradise

Don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after
No don't save a prayer for me now, save it till the
morning after
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after
Save it till the morning after

Save a prayer till the morning after
