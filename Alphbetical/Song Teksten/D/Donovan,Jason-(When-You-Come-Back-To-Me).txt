JASON DONOVAN - WHEN YOU COME BACK TO ME

(Words & music: Stock/Aitken/Waterman)

(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

So many people smiles on their faces
Armful of present going to places
There's a chill in the air
As I walk through the night
How I wish I could
Walk through the windows of time

Would I see happiness there
See your face everywhere
But the lights all go down
Over London town

There's a glow in my heart
Even though we're apart
'Cause I know yes I know
It's just a matter of time

Chorus:
I'm missing your love
Until you come back to me
I'm counting the hours until you return
There's a flame in my heart
And when you come back to me
Oh how the fire will burn

I sit by the fire
And try to remember
It won't be long
Till we're back together

But we're oceans apart
And nothing that I can do
Will speed the passing of time
Or bring me closer to you

And I keep thinking of you
And it keeps pulling me through
Like the songs that you sing
When you're lonely

But there's a glow in my heart
Even though we're apart
'Cause I know yes I know
It's just a matter of time

Chorus: ...

There's a flame in my heart
And when you come back to me
Oh how the fire will burn

And I keep thinking of you
And it keeps pulling me through
Like the songs that you sing
When you're lonely

But there's a glow in my heart
Even though we're apart
'Cause I know, yes I know
It's just a matter of time

Chorus: ...
