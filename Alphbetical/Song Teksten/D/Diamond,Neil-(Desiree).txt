Title  : DESIREE

(Words & music: Neil Diamond)

It was the third of June
On that younger day
Well I became a man
At the hands of a girl
Almost twice my age
And she came to me
Just like a morning sun
And it wasn't so much her words as
Such as the way they were sung
It was the way they were sung

Desiree, oh Desiree
There I was found by the sweet
Passion sound of your loving song
Time was right the night was long
Remember Desiree, oh Desiree
Somehow I knew I could only have you
Till the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet Desiree you made it right

Then came the fourth of June
On that sleepless night
Well I tossed and I turned white
The thought of her burned up and down my mind
For she was there and gone without one regret
But she continues on like the words of a song
I could not forget
I could not forget

Desiree, oh Desiree
And thought somehow I knew I could
Only have you till the morning light
Then night was long the time was right
Do you remember Desiree oh Desiree
Somehow I knew I could only have you
Till the morning light
If only for that single night
Sweet Desiree you made it right
