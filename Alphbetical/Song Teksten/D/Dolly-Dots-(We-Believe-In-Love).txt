Title  : WE BELIEVE IN LOVE

(Words & music: P. van Asten/R. de Bois)

Chorus:
I believe that love is there for giving
I believe there's love enough to share
There's no need for sadness while we're living
There's a need to love and need to care

Chorus: ...

Give your heart away to someone else
And make a friend, you know you can
Just in giving love away you'll get
It back again, there'll be no end

Chorus: ...

Open up your eyes and look around you
Open up your life before it ends
There's no time to waste on being lonely
Give yourself to someone and be friends

Give your heart away to someone else
And make a friend you know you can
Just in giving love away you'll get
It back again, there'll be no end

Chorus: ...2x...
