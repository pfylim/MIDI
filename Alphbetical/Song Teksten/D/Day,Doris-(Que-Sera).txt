When I was just a little boy - I ask my mother, what will I be
Will I be handsome, will I be rich - Here's what she say to me

Que Sera, Sera, what ever will be, will be
The futures not our to see, - Que Sera, Sera

When I'm just a boy in school - I ask my teacher, what should I try
Should I paint pictures, should I sing songs
Here's what he say to me

Refrain

When I grew out and fell in love - I ask my girl, what  lize again
Will we have rainbows, day after day
Quesst what my girlfriend said

Refrain

Now I have children of my own - ther ask there mother what will we be
Will we are pretty, will we be rich, I tell them what she say
