DSCHUNGELBOOK

Now I`m the King of the swingers, oh, the Jungle VIP
I`ve reached the top and had to stop and that`s what`s bothering me.
I wanna be a man, mancub and stroll right into town,
and be just like the other men- I'm tired of monkeyin' around.
Oh oobidoo I wanna be like you, I wanna walk like you,
talk like you,oohoo. 
You see it's true, an ape like me, can learn to be human too.

Now here's your part of the deal, 'cause. Laid a secret on me of 
man's great fire. 
Now don't try to kid me mancub, I made a deal with you. 
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream come true.
Now give me the secret mancub-come on, do clue me what to do.
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you.

BEAR NECESSITIES

Look for the bear necessities, the simple bear necessities,
forget about your worries and your strife.
I mean the bear necessities, all Mother Nature's recipes
that bring the bear necessities of life.
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam, I couldn`t be fonder of my big home.
The bees are buzzing in the tree to make some honey just for me
when you look under the rocks and plants, just take a glance at the
fancy ants and maybe try a few-the bear necessities of life will come to you-
they'll come to you.

Look for the bear necessities, the simple bear necessities,
forget about your worries and your strife.
I mean the bear necessities, that's why a bear can rest at ease,
with just the bear necessities of life.


Oh oobidoo I wanna be like you, I wanna walk like you,
talk like you,oohoo. 
You see it's true, an ape like me, can learn to be like someone like me.
Can learn to be like someone like you.
Can learn to be like someone like me.
