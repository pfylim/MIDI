Title  : SAUSOLITO SUMMERNIGHT
Artist : DIESEL

(Words & music: Boon/Vunderink)

We left for Frisco in your Rambler
The radiator's runnin' dry
I've never been much of a gambler
And had a preference to fly

You said: Forget about the airline
Let's take the car and save the fares
We blew a gasket on the Grapevine
And eight dollars on repairs

All on board (Sausolito summernight)

Hot summernight in Sausolito
Can't stand the heat another mile
Let's drop a quarter in the meter
And hit the sidewalk for a while

I'll have a burger and a rootbeer
You feed the heap some multigrade
A shot for Premium to boot dear
Will get her 'cross the Golden Gate

All on board (Sausolito summernight)

Another mile or two to Frisco
Two hundred gallons from L.A.
The engine's stomping like a disco
We oughta dump her in the bay

All on board (Sausolito summernight)

Crashin' all my checks
Scrapin' out my bank
Spend it on a Rambler with a whirlpool
In the tank
Look out over here
Watch out over here
Can't afford a blowout
'Cause we haven't got a spare

Hot summernight in Sausolito
(Sausolito summernight)
