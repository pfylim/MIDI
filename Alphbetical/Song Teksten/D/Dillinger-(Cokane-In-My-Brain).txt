Title  : COKANE IN MY BRAIN

(Words & music: Dillinger)

Hey Jim, Jim just a minute y'all
I want to ask you something
I want you to spell something for me Jim
Can you do that?
Sure John

I want you to spell for me New York, Jim
Well alright I'm gonna go ahead
New York, that's N E W Y O R K, man
No Jim you've made a mistake Jim
I'm gonna teach you the right way
And the proper way to spell New York
Well go ahead John

A knife, a fork, a bottle and a cork
That's the way we spell New York, Jim
You see I'm dynamite
So all you got to do is hold me tight
Because I'm outa sight, you know
Because I'm dynamite

But every time I walk in the rain
Man oh man I feel a pain
I feel a burning pain keep on
Burning in my bloody brain
I've got cokane running around my brain
Cokane running around my brain

I want you to dig me soul brothers and soul sisters
I want you to hold me tight, 'cause I'm dynamite
I got cokane running around my brain
No matter where I treat my guests
You see they always like my kitchen best
'Cause I've got cokane running around my brain
Cokane running around my brain

Hey Jim, Jim where is Jim man, Jim
I want to tell you something
I want you to spell for me New York
Can Jim spell New York for me?

Yeah right on
Man oh man I run around
I've got to tread the setting run
'Cause I've got cokane running around my brain
A whole lot of cokane running around my brain
