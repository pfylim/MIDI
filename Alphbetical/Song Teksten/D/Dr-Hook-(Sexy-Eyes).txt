I was sitting all alone
Watching people get it on
With each other.
They were dancing 'cross the floor
Turning, moving `ack and forth,
They were lovers
One more lonely night for me
I looked up what I did see

Sexy eyes
Moving crosss the floor
Got my wanting more
Sexy eyes
Sexy eyes
Gettin' down with you
I wanna move with you
Sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand
And we both began to dance
To the music.
Oh, your magic cast a spell!
It didn't take long till we fell
And we knew it.
No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be

Sexy eye's,...

No more lonely nights for me
This is how it's gonna be.
