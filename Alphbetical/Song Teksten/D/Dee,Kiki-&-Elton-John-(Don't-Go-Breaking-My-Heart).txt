Title  : DON'T GO BREAKING MY HEART

(Words & music: Orson/Blance)

Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Oh honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Oh honey when you knock on my door
Ooh, I gave you my key

Refrain:
Ooh ooh, nobody knows it
But when I was down
I was your clown
Ooh ooh, nobody knows it
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you may heart
Ooh ooh, I gave you my heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart

And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
Oh I think we can make it
Don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
Oh you put the spark to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights

Refrain: ...
