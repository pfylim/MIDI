Title  : A ROOM WITH A VIEW

(Words & music: N. Coward)

I've been cherishing
Through the perishing winter nights and days
A funny little phrase that means
Such a lot to me that you've got to be with me
Heart and soul
For on you the whole thing leans
Won't you kindly tell me what you're driving at
What conclusions you're arriving at
Please don't turn away or my dream will stay
Hidden out of sight
Among a lot of might have beens

A room with a view, and you
And no one to worry us, no one to hurry us
Through this dream we've found
We'll gaze at the sky and try to guess what it's all
About then we will figure out why the world is round
We'll be happy and contented as birds upon a tree
High above the mountains and sea
We'll bill and we'll coo, coo, coo
And sorrow will never come oh, will it ever come true
Our room with a view?

You're so practical, you'd make tactical errors as your wife
I'd try to set your life to rights
I'm upset a bit, for I get a bit dizzy now and then
Following the mental flights
Come with me and leave behind the noisy crowds
Sunlight shines for us above the clouds
My eyes glistened too while I listened to all the things you said
I'm glad I've got a head for heights

A room with a view and you and no one to give
Aside that sounds a paradise few fail to choose
With fingers entwine we'll find relief from the
Preachers who always beseech us to mind our p's and q's
We'll watch the whole world pass before us
While we are sitting still
Leaning on our own window sill
We'll bill and we'll coo, coo, coo
And sorrow will never come oh, will it ever come true
Our room with a view?
