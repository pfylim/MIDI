  13. TAKE CONTROL (DJ BOBO)
  
  
  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR MIND YOUR BODY AND YOUR SOUL
  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR MIND YOUR BODY AND YOUR SOUL
  
  YOU TAKE A SHAKE A BREAK I'M NOT FAKE
  YOU COOL THE WAY YOU MOVE THE MORE MISTAKE
  CAN'T STAND STILL, I'VE GOT TO MOVE
  FEEL THE BASS LINE FEEL THE GROOVE
  THE BEAT THE BASS THE LOOKS ARE FINE
  GET ON THE FLOOR YOU GOT ALL TIME
  PARTY PEOPLE I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE 
  PUT UP YOUR HEADS AND FEEL IN TRANCE
  
  EVERYBODY TAKE A CHANCE WAVING UP YOUR HANDS
  CAN'T YOU FEEL THIS TRANCE
  EVERYBODY TAKE A CHANCE WAVING UP YOUR HANDS
  CAN'T YOU FEEL THIS TRANCE 
  
  TAKE CONTROL
  
  CAN YOU SEE NOW WHAT I'M SAYING
  THE BEAT IS LOUD AND I AM PLAYING  
  I'M PLAYING WITH YOUR LIFE
  I'M PLAYING WITH YOUR SOUL
  HEAR OLD STATION UNDER MY CONTROL
  SO LET THE RHYTHM KEEP YOU ON THE FLOOR
  WITH THE BASS AND THE DRUM
  THAT YOU NEVER HEAR BEFORE 
  OPEN YOUR MIND 'CAUSE WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT DANCIN'
  OPEN YOUR MIND IT'S NOT ROMANCING
  
  EVERYBODY TAKE A CHANCE WAVING UP YOUR HANDS
  CAN'T YOU FEEL THIS TRANCE
  EVERYBODY TAKE A CHANCE WAVING UP YOUR HANDS
  CAN'T YOU FEEL THIS TRANCE
  
  TAKE CONTROL

  YOU TAKE A SHAKE A BREAK I'M NOT FAKE
  YOU COOL THE WAY YOU MOVE THE MORE MISTAKE
  CAN'T STAND STILL I'VE GOT TO MOVE
  FEEL THE BASS LINE FEEL THE GROOVE
  THE BEAT THE BASS THE LOOKS ARE FINE
  GET ON THE FLOOR YOU'VE GOT ALL TIME
  PARTY PEOPLE I WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE
