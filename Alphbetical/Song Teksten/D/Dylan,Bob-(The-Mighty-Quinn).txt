Titel:  The Mighty Quinn
Artist: Bob Dylan

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn

Ev'rybody's building ships and boats
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes.
Ev'rybody's in despair, ev'ry girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna jump for joy.
Come all without...

I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
Ev'ryone's beneath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
All the pigeons gonna rum to him.
Come all without...

Let me do what I wanna do, I can recite 'em all
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on ev'ryones toes.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
Ev'rybody's gonna wanna doze.
