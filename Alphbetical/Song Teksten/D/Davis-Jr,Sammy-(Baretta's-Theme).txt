Title  : BARETTA'S THEME

Don't go to bed, with no price on your head
(Don't do it)
Don't do the crime, if you can't do the time
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow

Don't roll the dice if you can't pay the price
(Don't do it)
Don't run your feet, down a dead end street
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow

Don't do me dirt, or you gonna get hurt
(Don't do it)
Don't run away, till you hear what I say
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow

I'm gonna go where the cold winds don't blow
Ain't gonna fight with no thief in the night
(Won't do it)
Keep your eye on the sparrow
When the going gets narrow
