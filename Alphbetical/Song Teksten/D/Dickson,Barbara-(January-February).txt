You just say the things you want to hear
And like a fool I believed everything was clear
But now I feel so distant
I don't know what to say
The things I thought important are just another day
And you and I are miles and miles apart
You got me on the road
To one more broken heart.

January, February
I don't understand
Why it is you say you're leaving
Then you turn around
You want settle down
You've got both feet off the ground
January, February
Don't you come around.

Wake up I tell myself but I don't even hear
One more night, another day, another year
It doesn't seem to matter
'Cos you don't seem to care
If only there was some way out
A way to anywhere
'Cos you and I are miles and miles apart
You got me on the road
To one more broken heart.

January, February,...

It doesn't seem to matter
'Cos you don't seem to care,...

January, February,...

Oh, January, February
Don't you come around.
