11. The Captain Of her Heart - Double

It was way past midnight
And she still could'nt fall asleep
This night the dream was leaving
She tried so hard to keep
And with the new day's dawning
She felt it drifting away
Not only for a cruise
Not only for a day

Too long ago too far apart
She could'nt wait another day for
The captain of her heart

As the day came up she made a start
She stopped waiting another day for
The captain of her heart
