EL DeBARGE - LOVE ALWAYS

I got a secret for you
Can't believe myself
But ever since you've been gone
I think of no one else
And every day you're away
Is driving me crazy
So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name

Refrain:
Love always
And even if the sun falls down
I will always be around
Forever and always
Darling if we both can wait
We'll have the time to celebrate
For the rest of our lives, love always

And lots of people I know
Try to shape your mind
But that can't happen to me
I'm not the jealous kind
No one can change what I feel
And nothin' can make me
Still I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name

Refrain: ...

For the rest of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives

We'll always be
So faithfully
Just hang on to me forever
So I'll write you every night
And I'll sign my name

Love always
On and if by now you haven't guessed
I will add one more P.S.
For the rest of our lives, love always
For the rest of our lives, love always
I'll sign this letter to you
Love always
