There's a rose in black and Spanish Harlem,
a rose in black and Spanish Harlem.
It is a special one, it's never seen the sun,
it only comes up when the moon is on the run
and all the stars are gleaming,
it's growing in the street, right up thru' the concrete
but so sweet and dreamy.

There's a rose in Spanish Harlem,
a rose in black and Spanish Harlem,
with eyes as black as coal that look down in
your soul and start a fire there and then he loses control,
I'm gonna beg his pardon yeah.
He's going to pick that rose 
and watch her as she grows in his garden,

La la la  la la la   la la la la 
La la la  la la la   la la la la
