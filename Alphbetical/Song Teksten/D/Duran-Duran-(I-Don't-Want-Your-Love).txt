DURAN DURAN - I DON'T WANT YOUR LOVE

(Words & music: Taylor/Rhodes/LeBon)

I don't mind if you're keeping someone else behind
I don't care 'cause you got something I can share
They take a chance even is it's only
Only while we are dancing in the light
Of your second sigh
Because when you understand me
You might feel good around me now
I don't want your love so turn it around
I won't turn you out if you got someone else
Someone else you care about
Because you must realize my obsessive
Fascination is in your imagination
Now break it up
I don't want your love to break me down
I don't want your love so turn it around
The rhythm is the power to move me
Something in control completely
I don't want your love
I don't want your love
I like noise, 'cause I like waking up the house
Cannot sit down, and shut my mouth
Because when you understand me
You might feel good around me
