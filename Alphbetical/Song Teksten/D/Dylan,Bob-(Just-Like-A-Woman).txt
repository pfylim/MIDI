Titel:  Just Like A Woman
Artist: Bob Dylan


Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes
But late-ly     I   see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

Chorus:

She takes just like a  woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a  woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a  woman
But she breaks just like a little     girl.

Verse 2

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Noboby has to guess,
That baby can't be blessed,
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest.
With her fog,
Her amphetamines
And her pearls

Chorus

Bridge :

It was raining from the first
And I was dying of thirst
So I came in here
And you long time curse hurts
But whats worse is this pain in here  
 I can't stay in here
Ain't it   clear  that 

Verse 3

I just can't fit.
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit.
And when we meet again,
Introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when,
I was hungry,
And it was your world then.

Chorus
