Title  : WHO'S IN THE STRAWBERRY PATCH WITH SALLY

One day happy one day sad
Feelin' good and feelin' bad
In anger words are spoken
Then in haste a heart is broken

Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Now that she's not picking them with me
No, I don't care what they're doing there
'Neath the shade of the old apple tree

I bet they're laughing and talking love talk
Just like the way we used to do
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Whispering I love you

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love maker
That I ever had, that's right
Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
Making love to her tonight

I can't take it, I just can't take it
It's driving me mad
Sally was the best love maker
That I ever had, oh

Who's in the strawberry patch with Sally
While the wabash moon is shining bright
Had I been true to her I'd be the one
In the strawberry patch with Sally tonight
In the strawberry patch with Sally tonight
