In the chilly hours and minutes
of uncertainty I want to be in the warm
hold of your lovin' mind.
to feel you all around me and to take your hand
along the sand.
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind.

When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
and everywhere I'd look your eyes I'd find
for me to love you now would be the
sweetest thing t'would make me sing.
Ah but I may sa well try and catch the wind.

When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears
to help me to leave all my blues behind
standing in your heart
is where I want to be and long to be.
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind.
