Titel:        A SPACEMAN CAME TRAVELLING

---------------------------------------------------------------------

A Spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar
'twas light years of time since his mission did start
and over a village he halted his craft
and it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star.....

He followed a light and came down to a shed,
where a mother and child were lying there on a bed
a bright light of silver shone round his head
and he had the face of an angel, and they were afraid.....

Then the stranger spoke, he said "do not fear,
I come from a planet a long way from here,
and I bring a message for mankind to hear"
and suddenly the sweetest music filled the air.....
And it went La La.....
peace and godwill to all men, and love for the child.....

This lovely music went trembling through the ground
and many were wakened on hearing that sound
and travellers on the road, the village they found,
by the light of that ship in the sky wich shone all around.....

And just before the dawn at the pailing of the sky
the stranger returned and said "Now I must fly,
when two thousand years of your time has gone by
this song will begin once again, to a baby's cry".....

And it went  La La..... this song will begin once again, to a baby's 
cry"..... 
and it goes La La ..... peace and godwill to all men, and love for 
the child..... 

Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear that song again
there are thousands standing on the edge of the world
and a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly here
this song will begin once again, to a baby's cry".....
