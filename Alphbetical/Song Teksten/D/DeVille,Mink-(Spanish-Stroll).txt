(Words & music: Mink Deville)

Hey mister Jim, 
I can see the shape you're in
Finger on your eyebrow
And left hand on your hip
Thinkin' that you're such a lady killer
Think you're so slick, well alright
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh 

Brother Johnny,
He caught a plane and he got on it
Now he's a razor in the wind
And he's got a pistol in his pocket
They say the man is crazy on the coast
Lord, there ain't no doubt about it
Well alright, 
Ooh ooh ooh oohooh ooh 

Sister Sue, tell me baby what are we gonna do
And she said, take the candles 
And then burn them out
Make a paper boat, light it and send it out
Send it out now

Rosita,...
