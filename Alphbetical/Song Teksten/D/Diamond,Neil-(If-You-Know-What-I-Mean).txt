Singer : NEIL DIAMOND 
Title  : IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

When the night returns just like a friend
When the evening comes to set me free
When the quiet hours that wait beyond 
The day make peaceful sound in me

Took a drag from my last cigarette
Took a drink from a glass of old wine
I closed my eyes and I could make it real
And feel it one more time

Can you hear it babe
Can you hear it babe
From another time
From another place
Do you remember it babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade if you know what I mean

Here's to the songs we used to sing
And here's to the times we used to know
It's hard to hold them in our arms again
And hard to let them go

Do you hear it babe
Do you hear it babe
It was another time
It was another place
Do you remember it babe

And the radio played like a carnival tune
As we lay in our bed in the other room
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream
In a penny arcade if you know what I mean
