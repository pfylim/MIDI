Singer : IAN DURY 
Title  : SEX AND DRUGS AND ROCK'N'ROLL

(Words & music: Ian Dury/Chas Jankel)

Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Is all my brain and body need
Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Is very good indeed

Keep your silly ways
Or throw them out the window
The wisdom of your ways
I've been there and I know
Lots of other ways
What a jolly bad show
If all you ever do
Is business you don't like

Chorus:
Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Sex and drugs and rock'n'roll
Is very good indeed

Every bit of clothing
Ought to make you pretty
You can cut the clothing
Grey is such a pity
I should wear the clothing
Of mister Walter Mitty
See my tailor, he's called Simon
I know it's going to fit

Chorus: ...

Here's a little bit of advice
You're quite welcome, it is free
Don't do nothing that is cut-price
You know what that'll make you be
They will try their tricky device
Trap you with the ordinary
Get your teeth into a small slice
Of the cake of liberty

Chorus: ...
