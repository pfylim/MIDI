
8. LOVE IS THE PRICE - D.J. BOBO

Babies in the parlor waiting for the rain.
Beating like a hammer, washing out her pain
Beating like the one seven years ago
When her first big love melted like snow.
Back then she doubted she would ever find a man
Who could love her that way
The same way again.
And just when she thought she was living in vain
The man of her dreams came like the rain.

Chorus:
When love is the price, freedom is the cost.
Love is the price, freedom is the cost.
And just when you think everything is lost
Love will be your price.
And I know I would not change a thing.
`Cause I know I would not change a thing.

They spoke about their dreams,
They spoke about love.
They spoke about the things she was so afraid of.
He had the key word for everything she felt
So it didn`t take long till he got her nailed.
Pin ones hope on someone elses life
And all your dreams will hurt you like a knife.
The same with her, she soon got lost.
When love is the price freedom is the cost.

Chorus:

She didn`t trust that very first man
To come into her life trying to understand
What nobody ever could before.
He only made her see there is something more.
To learn about freedom, to feel about love.
To hiddle all the things she was so afraid of.
To always follow what she really felt inside.
Everything else is like a rollercoast ride.

Chorus (2x)
