Title  : HOW GLAD I AM

My love has no beginning, my love has no end
No front nor back and my love won't bend
I'm in the middle lost in a spin, loving you
And you don't know you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, my love has no top
I'm in the middle and I can't stop loving you
And you don't know you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

I wish I was a poet so I could express
What I'd what I'd like to say
I wish I were an artist so I could paint
A picture of how I feel of how I feel today

My love has no walls on either side
That makes my love wider than wide
I'm in the middle and I can't hide loving you
And you don't know you don't know
You don't know, you don't know
How glad I am
