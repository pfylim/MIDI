It is real, what I feel, is it love
it is love that's making me weak, in the night
and when she's next to me
I just stumble on my words
and all the things I want to say
come out wrong
I am lost in a dream
But I know this is more than it seems
I need a little help

Someone put on a love song
to bring her closer to me
all I want is this diamond in the dark
to begin what must be

When she turns at her name, when she smiles
when she smiles, I feel it again, in my heart
across the crowded room
she is just a dance away
and I can feel her like a fire that's burning strong
she keeps looking at me
and I know this was all meant tobe
and then it had to come

Someone put on a love song
to bring her closer to me
all I want is this diamond in the dark
to begin what must be
all I want is this diamond in the dark
to begin what must be
all I want is this diamond in the dark
to begin what must be
all I want is this diamond in the dark
to begin what must be
