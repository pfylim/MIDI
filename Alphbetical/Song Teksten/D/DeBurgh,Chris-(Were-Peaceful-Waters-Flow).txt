Restless hearts, it has been along time
out here on the journey, for a glimpse of paradise
it's getting hard to find a place to go
where peaceful waters flow

I took a walk past the old Saxon well
down by the cathedral I heard the chapel bell
and joined the people singing for a way to go
where peaceful waters flow

And if you don't know by now, you never will
only love can find the door
if you could see it now, it's in your hand
only love can reach the shore to heaven

Always, she is standing by my side
she's my inspiration, and she's my battle cry
and in her arms is the only place I know
where the peaceful waters flow

And if you don't know by now, you never will
only love can find the door
if you could see it now, it's in your hand
only love can reach the shore forevermore
where peaceful waters flow.....
