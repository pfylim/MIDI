Title  : Groove Is In The Heart
Singer : Deee Lite


The chills that you spill
Up my back
Keep me filled with satisfaction
When we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
I couldn't ask for another
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls only the bridge
My supperdish, my succotash wish
I couldn't ask for another
I couldn't ask for another
Groove is in the heart
The depth of hula groove
Move us to the hoop
We're goin' thru to
Horten hears a who
I couldn't ask for another
Dj soul was on a roll
I been told he can't be sold
Not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
Groove is in the heart
