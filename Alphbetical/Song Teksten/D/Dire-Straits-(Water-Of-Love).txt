Title  : WATER OF LOVE

(Words & music: Mark Knopfler)

High and dry in the long hot day
Lost and lonely every way
Got the flats all around me
Sky up above
Yes, I need a little water of love

Too long lonely and my heart feels pain
Crying out for some soothing rain
I believe I have taken enough
Yes, I need a little water of love

Chorus:
Water of love
Deep in the ground
But there ain't no water here to be found
Someday, baby, when the river runs free
It's gonna carry that water of love to me

There's a bird up in a tree, sittin' up high
Sits there waiting for me to die
If I don't get some water soon
I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon

Once I had a woman, I could call my own
Once I had a woman, now my woman she's gone
Once there was a river
Now there's a stone
You know it's evil when you're living alone

Chorus: ...
