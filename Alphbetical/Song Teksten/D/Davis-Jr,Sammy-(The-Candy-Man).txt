THE CANDY MAN - SAMMY DAVIS JR.


Candy man, hey candy man.

Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew.
Cover it with chocolate and a miracle or two.
The candy man, oh the candy man can.
The candy man can `cause he mixes it with love. 
And makes the world taste good.

Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh.
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie.
The candy man, the candy man can.
The candy man can `cause he mixes it with love. 
And makes the world taste good.

The candy man makes everything he bakes.
Satisfying and delicious. 
Talk about your childhood wishes.
You can even eat the dishes.

Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream.
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream.
The candy man, oh the candy man can.
The candy man can `cause he mixes it with love. 
And makes the world taste good.

The candy man makes everything he bakes.
Satisfying and delicious. 
Talk about your childhood wishes.
You can even eat the dishes.

Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream.
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream.
The candy man, oh the candy man can.
The candy man can `cause he mixes it with love. 
And makes the world taste good.
Yes the candy man can `cause he mixes it with love. 
And makes the world taste good.

A candy man (repeat)
