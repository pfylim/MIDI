Title  : People Are People
Singer : Depeche Mode


Chorus:
People are people, so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully 
(2x)

So we're different colours
And we're different creeds
And different people
Have different needs

It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you
So what could I have done
I can't understand what makes a man
Hate another man, help me understand

Chorus
Help me understand (2x)

How you're punching
And you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fists
I can't understand what makes a man
Hate another man, help me understand

Chorus
I can't understand what makes a man
Hate another man, help me understand, etc
