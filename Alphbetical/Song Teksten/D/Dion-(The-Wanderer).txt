                             THE WANDERER


     Oh!...well I'm the type o' guy who will never settle down,...
     where pretty girls are, well ya know that I'm around,..
     I kiss 'em an' I love 'em, 'cause to me they're all the same
     I hug 'em an' I squeeze 'em, they don't even know my name

     They call me the wanderer,..yeah, the wanderer...
     I roam around, around, around...

     Oh!...well there's Flo' on my left arm 
     an' there's Mary on my right arm..
     an' Janie is the girl well that I'll be with tonight a..
     an' when she asks me which one I love the best a,..
     I tear open my shirt an' I show her Rosie on my chest

     'Cause I'm a wanderer,..yeah, a wanderer...
     I roam around, around, around, around, nn'...

     Oh, well I roam  from town to town ,...
     I go through life...without a care,...
     an' I'm as happy as a clown,...
     a with my two fists of iron but I'm goin' nowhere 'round.

     Oh, yeah, I'm the type o' guy...that likes to roam around..
     I'm never in one place,..I roam from town to town..
     an' when I find myself..mm a fallin' for some girl..
     yeah, I hop right in a that car o' mine..
     I drive around the world

     Yeah, I'm a wanderer,..yeah, a wanderer...
     I roam around, around, around, around,...mm'...along 'n let it go!...
