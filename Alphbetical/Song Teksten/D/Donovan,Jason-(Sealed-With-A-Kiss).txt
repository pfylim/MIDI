JASON DONOVAN - SEALED WITH A KISS

(Words & music: Geld/Udell)

Though we've got to say goodbye for the summer
Darling I promise you this
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed it with a kiss

Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my dreams
Every day in a letter
Sealed it with a kiss

I'll see you in the sunlight
I'll hear your voice everywhere
I'll run to tenderly hold you
But darling you won't be there

I don't wanna say goodbye for the summer
Knowing the love we'll miss
Oh let us make a pledge
To meet in September
And seal it with a kiss

Yes it's gonna be a cold lonely summer
But I'll fill the emptiness
I'll send you all my love
Every day in a letter
Sealed it with a kiss

Sealed it with a kiss
Sealed it with a kiss
