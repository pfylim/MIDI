D.C. LEE - SEE THE DAY

When you look at me
Tell me what you see
Do you see no love at all
Oh do you see in me
What you always see
In every girl that you fall for

I will show you
How love is meant to be
Just watch and learn
And listen to me

Refrain:
Will you ever see the day
Heartache leads astray
Good love will always come from me
Will you ever learn to love
Without a little doubt
Good love will always come from me

When you look away
Is it mean to say
That she holds you night and day
And does it hurt your heart
When I say let's start
To yield the part that's been told
Don't you see that I
Am really worth a try

And I say to you
I know just what to do
