  11. THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER (D:REAM)
  
  YOU CAN WALK MY PATH, YOU CAN WEAR MY SHOES
  LEARN TO TALK LIKE ME AND BE AN ANGEL TOO
  BUT MAYBE YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA FEEL THIS WAY
  YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA KNOW ME, BUT I KNOW YOU
  I'M SINGING IT NOW
  THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER
  THEY CAN ONLY GET BETTER IF WE SEE IT THROUGH
  THAT MEANS ME AND I MEAN YOU TOO
  SO TEACH ME NOW THAT THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER
  THEY CAN ONLY GET BETTER, THEY ONLY GET, TAKE IT ON FROM
  HERE
  YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER
  I SOMETIMES LOSE MYSELF IN ME, I LOSE TRACK OF TIME
  AND I CAN'T SEE THE WOOD FOR THE TREES
  YOU SET THEM ALIGHT,
  BURNING THE BRIDGES AS YOU'VE GONE
  I'M TOO WEAK TO FIGHT YA,
  I'VE GOT MY PERSONAL HELL TO DEAL WITH, THEN YOU SAY
  WALK MY PATH, WEAR MY SHOES, TALK LIKE THAT
  I'LL BE AN ANGEL THEN
  THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER
  THEY CAN ONLY GET BETTER, NOW I FOUND YOU
  THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER, THEY CAN ONLY GET
  BETTER, NOW I FOUND YOU
  AND YOU AND YOU
  YOU HAVE SHOWN ME PREJUDICE AND GREED
  AND YOU'VE SHOWN ME HOW I MUST LEARN TO DEAL WITH
  THIS DISEASE
  I LOOK AT THINGS NOW IN DIFFERENT LIGHT THAN I DID
  BEFORE
  AND I'VE FOUND THE CAUSE,
  AND I THINK YOU CAN BE MY CURE
  SO TEACH ME TO...
  WALK YOUR PATH, WEAR YOUR SHOES, TALK LIKE THAT,
  I'LL BE AN ANGEL AND
  THINGS CAN ONLY GET BETTER...
