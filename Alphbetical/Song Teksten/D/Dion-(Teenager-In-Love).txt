                        Teenager in Love


Each time we had a quarrel it almost breaks my heart
'cause I am so afraid that we would have to part
each night I ask the stars up above
why must I be a teenager in love

One day I feel so happy next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll have to take the good and the bad
each night I ask the stars up above
why must I be a teenager in love

I cried a tear for nobody but you
I'll be the lonely one if you should make me blue

well if you want to break my heart that won't be so hard to do
and if you should say good-bye I'll still go on lovin' you

'cause each night I'll ask the stars upl above
why must I be a teenager in love
why must I be a teenager in love
