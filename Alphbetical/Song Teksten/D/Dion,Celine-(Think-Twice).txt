12. THINK TWICE - CELINE DION 

Don't think I can't feel 
That there's something wrong.
You've been the sweetest
Part of my life for so long.
I look in your eyes.
There's a distant light.
And you and I know there'll 
Be a storm tonight.
This is getting serious.
Are you thinking 'bout you or us. 

Chorus
Don't say what you're about to say.
Look back before you leave my life.
Be sure before you close that door.
Before you roll those dice.
Baby think twice.

Baby think twice for the sake 
Of our love for the memory.
For the fire and the faith 
That was you and me.
Baby I know it ain't easy 
When your soul cries out 
For a higher ground.
Cause when you're halfway up
You're always halfway down.
But baby this is serious.
Are you thinking 'bout you or us.

Chorus

Baby this is serious.
Are you thinking 'bout you or us.

Baby
Don't say what you're about to say.
No no no no
Look back before you leave my life.
Don`t leave my life
Be sure before you close that door
Before you roll those dice.
Don't do what you're about to do
My everything depends on you.
I depend on you
And whatever it takes I'll sacrifice
Before you roll those dice.
