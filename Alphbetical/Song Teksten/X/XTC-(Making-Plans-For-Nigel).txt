Title  : MAKING PLANS FOR NIGEL

(Words & music: Colin Moulding)

We're only making plans for Nigel
We only want what's best for him
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel just needs this helping hand

Chorus:
And if young Nigel says he's happy
He must be happy
He must be happy in his work

And if young Nigel says he's happy
He has a future in a British steel
We're only making plans for Nigel
Nigel's whole future is as good as sealed

Chorus: ...

Nigel is not outspoken
But he likes to speak
And loves to be spoken to
Nigel is happy in his work
We're only making plans for Nigel
