                             LAND DOWN UNDER

     As performed by: Men at work          

     Travelling in a fried out combi,...
     on a heavy trail-head full of zombie...
     I met a strange lady,..she made me nervous...
     she took me in an' gave me breakfast...an' she said

     "Do you come from a land down under?".....
     "where women blow an' men thunder".....
     "can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?".....
     "you better run, you better take cover".....

     BRIDGE................................................

     Frying bread from a man in Brussels,...
     he was..six foot four..an' full o' muscles...
     I said "do you speak a my language?"...
     he just smiled an' gave me a vegamite sandwich...an' he said

     "Are you come from a land down under?".....
     "where women blow an' men thunder".....
     "can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?".....
     "you better run, you better take cover"..yea-aaah!...

     LONG BRIDGE...........................................................

     Lyin' in a den in Bombay,...with a slack jaw..an' not much to say.....
     I said to the man: "are you trying to tempt me,...
     because I come from the land of plenty?"...an' he said oh!

     "Do you come from a land down under?"..ooh-yea-yeah!...
     "where women blow an' men thunder".....
     "can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?"..na-a!
     you better run, you better take cover...'cause we are..

     livin' in..the land down under.....
     where women blow an' men thunder...yea-eah
     can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder (the thunder)..
     you better run, you better take cover.....            

     livin' in..the land down under.....
     the women blow an' men thunder......
     can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder..ooh-yeah!...
     you better run, you better take cover...we are          

     livin' in..the land down under.....
     where women blow an' men thunder...yea-yeah...
     can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder.....
     you better run, you better take cover.....

     livin' in..the land down under..(livin' in the land down under)...
     where women blow an' men thunder...yea-yeah...
