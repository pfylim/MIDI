She may look real cute, but let me tell you man
She ain't a square
Whenever she starts rocking hot, she needs some
Air and we go

Rockin' in the streets

We don't see nobody, we're rocking side by side
We're up in heaven, don't watch no traffic lights
We keep-a-rockin' and-a-rolling and-a-dancing
All through the night
