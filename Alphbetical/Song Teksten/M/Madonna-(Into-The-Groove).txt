MADONNA - INTO THE GROOVE

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah step to the beat
Boy what will it be?

Music can be such a revelation
Dancin' around you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feelin' never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancin' can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors and no one can see
I'm tired of dancin' here all by myself
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah step to the beat
Boy what will it be?

I'd like to know you in a special way
This doesn't happen to me everyday
Don't try to hide it love has no disguise
I see the fire burnin' in your eyes

Only when I'm dancin' can I feel this free
At night I lock the doors and no one else can see
I'm tired of dancin' here all by myself
Tonight I wanna dance with someone else

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah step to the beat
Boy what will it be?

Love out your fantasy here with me
Just let the music set you free
Touch my body and move in tight
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine
Now I know you're mine

Get into the groove
Boy you've got to prove
Your love to me yeah
Get up on your feet
Yeah step to the beat
Boy what will it be?
