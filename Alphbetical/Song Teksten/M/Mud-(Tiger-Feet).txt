Title  : TIGER FEET

Ooh Ooh Ooh
All night long you've been looking at me
Well you know you're the dance hall cuty
That you love to be
Oh well now
You've been layin' it down
You got your hips swinging out of bounds
And I like the way you do
What you're doin' to me

Alright, well that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right
I really love your tiger light
And that's neat, that's neat
that's neat, that's neat
I really love your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Your tiger feet
Well alright

Flash your warming lights just as long as you like
I know your achin' to be makin' me tonight
I got a feelin' in my knees
A feelin' only you can please
And there ain't no way
I'm gonna let you out of my sight

That's right (that's right)
That's neat (that's neat)
I really love your tiger feet
I really love your tiger feet
Well alright now

That's right (7x)
That's neat (4x)
I really love, I really love
I really love, I really love
Your tiger feet
Well that's ...
