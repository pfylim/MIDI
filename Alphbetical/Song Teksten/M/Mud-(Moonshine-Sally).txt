Title  : MOONSHINE SALLY

Sweet little Moonshine Sally
I got your picture on my wall
You live in Tukalo Valley
Beside the fire waterfall
Every night I hear you call
From beneath the waterfall
(In the light of the magic
moon I hear you call)

Hey hey hey I wanna take, don't wanna make you
Live with me in Tukalo Valley
Hey hey hear me calling magic's falling all around
Moonshine Sally, Moonshine Sally from Tukalo Valley

They talk of voices in the valley
They say the evil moon is high
They say they'll hear no more of Sally
Where the magic waterfall runs dry
Still ev'ry night I hear you call from the
magic waterfall
(In the light of the magic
moon I hear you call)
