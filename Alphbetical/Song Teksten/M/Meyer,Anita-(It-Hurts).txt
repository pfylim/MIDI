Title  : IT HURTS

(Words & music: Hans Vermeulen)

Many times I find myself wondering what I've learned
Each day I fell in love with you
I feel like waking up and thinking
Man, this is heaven
Ain't never had nobody else but you
It took some time to realize
I'd never have you by my side
Although you made believe you'd never let it go
Oh, no

And then I changed my way of life
Trying to forget it
I even tried to put the blame on you
But every time I acted as if we never had it
I only lost myself in loving you
Your way to avoid my eyes
Only made me realize
I'd never know if you had seen
The things I showed
Oh, no, it hurts me so

Make believe you never really felt the pain
Just achieve your mission and you will remain
For now and ever
I will make believe I never felt no pain
Promise, but I'm so afraid it will remain
For now and ever, and ever

There's so many ways of losing you
God, I've tried them all
There is still my way of loving you
Keeps me awaiting your call
Lost in a silver dream
That never turns into gold
Something special, something old

Yes, I'll always wonder what you'll do
Although I don't know what to do
I'll never see the answer
Just because I love you so

I will make believe I never felt no pain
Promise, but I'm so afraid it will remain
For now and ever
Make believe you never really felt the pain
Just achieve your mission and you will remain
For you

I know that we won't ever really be together
I know for sure I will remember you
Maybe when we get another chance to do it better
I can live another life with you
'Cause everything that we done wrong
You used to make it strong
It doesn't mean to make believe
I hope it helps to show
Oh, no it hurts me so
