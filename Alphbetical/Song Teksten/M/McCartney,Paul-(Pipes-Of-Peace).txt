PAUL McCARTNEY - PIPES OF PEACE

I light a candle to our love
In our love problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover that
one and one is all we long to hear

All round the world little children being born to the world
Got to give them all we can till the war is won: then will
the work be done
(What are we going to do?)

Help them to learn (help them to learn)
songs of joy instead
Of burn, baby burn (burn, baby burn)
Let us all show them how
to play the pipes of peace, play the pipes of peace

Ooh, I light a candle to our love
In our love problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover that
one and one is all we long to hear

What do you say (what do you say?)
Will the human race be run
In a day (in a day)
Or will someone save this planet we're playing on?
It is the only one? (What are we going to do?)
Help me to learn songs of joy instead of
burn, baby burn

Won't you show me how to play (how to play)
the pipes of peace (pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace

Ooh, I light a candle to our love
In our love problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover that
one and one is all we long to hear

Help them to see (help them to see)
That people here are like
You and me (you and me)
Let us show them how to play (how to play)
the pipes of peace (pipes of peace)
Play the pipes of peace

Ooh, I light a candle to our love
In our love problems disappear
But all in all we soon discover that
one and one is all we long to hear
