Title  : DANCING IN THE CITY

(Words & music: Marshall & Hain)

If you're a stranger here
And you need some action
We have a remedy
That could really catch on

Pleased to see another face
At light up time
If you're feeling dull and run down
We can really make you shine

Chorus:
Dancing in the city
Alleys that we run through
Now we've just begun to
Have fun tonight

Can yo feel the darkness call
Let the streets have their way
They'll carry on till morning
And steal your soul away

Chorus: ...4x...
