11. Take A Bow - Madonna

Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low
The curtains are down
There's no one here
(There's no one here in the crowd)
Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around
Watching you, watching me
One lonely star
(One lonely star you don't know who you are)

CHORUS
I've always been in love with you
I guess you've always known it's true
You took my love for granted why oh
Why
The show is over say good-bye
Say good-bye, say good-bye

Make them laught
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart
Hide behing your smile
All the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile the whole world
loves a clown)
Wish you well
I cannot stay
You deserve an award
For the role that you played
No more masquerade
You're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know
who you are)

CHORUS
All the world is a stage
And everyone has their part
How was I to know
Which way the story'd go
How was I to know you'd break
You'd break, you'd break, you'd
break
You'd break my heart

CHORUS
