Title  : WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE

(Words & music: Tom Shapiro/Dan Foliart)

You've been lonely so long
So lonely, but here you go
Hoping that no one will find you
And all you know are glimpses of love
Left behind you, soon to fade away

Why should sorrow blind tomorrow
When in my eyes
Your life is about to awaken
And all those lies you believed
Are about to be shaken
It's up to you to say

Chorus:
If you want to find love
Then face the light
If you want to be held
Hold back the night
If you want your dreams to ride
The height of what might be
When it comes to love
Come to me, come to me

I'll be there, I need to be there
Just to ease the load
When it's time for the ties to unravel
To be the road
You take when you're ready to travel
It's up to you to say

Chorus: ...

When you're ready to shine
Then face the light
When you want to be loved
Hold back the night
If you want your dreams to ride
The height of what might be
When it comes to love come to me
