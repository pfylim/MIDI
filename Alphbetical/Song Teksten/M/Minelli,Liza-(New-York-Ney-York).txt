6. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - LIZA MINELLI 

Start spreadin' the news,
I'm leaving today,
I wanna be a part of it
New york, new york.

These vagabond shoes
Are longlng to stray,
And step around
The heart of it
New york, New York.

I wanna wake up in the city
That doesn't sleep
To find i'm king
Of the hill,
Top of the heap.

My little town blues
Are melting away,
I'll make a brand
New start of it
In old new york.
If i can make it there,
I'd make it anywhere,
It's up to you,
New york, New York.

(instrumental interlude)

And step around
The heart of it
New york, New York.

I wanna wake up in the city that
Doesn't sleep
To find i'm king of the hill,
Head of the list,
Cream of the crop
At the top of the list.

My little town blues
Are melting away,
I'll make a brand
New game of it
In old new york.
If i can make it there
I'd make it anywhere,
Come on, come through,
New york, New York
