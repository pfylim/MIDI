  2. DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER (M PEOPLE)
  
  
  SOMEONE TO COUNT ON, IN A WORLD EVER CHANGIN'
  HERE I AM STOP WHERE YOU'RE STANDIN'
  WHAT YOU NEED IS A LOVER, SOMEONE TO TAKE OVER
  
  OH BABY DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER
  
  STRANGE WHEN YOU THINK OF OUR CHANCES
  THAT WE'VE BOTH BEEN IN A STATE OF MIND
  TOO COLD TO BE CARELESS
  LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT THING
  
  OH BABY DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER
  
  TONIGHT WE'RE GONNA TASTE A LITTLE PARADISE
  ROCKIN' ALL NIGHT LONG
  DAYLIGHT I'LL STILL BE LOOKING IN YOUR HEAVENLY EYES
  
  DAY O UMBA DAY O MABU JI AY O
  DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER
  DAY O UMBA DAY O NA JAM BAY UM BAY O
  DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER
