All that I know in my life
I have learned on the street
no magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet
will I wake up from this nightmare ?
a fear that chills me to the bone
though I may be one of many
I feel so all alone

We are the children of the night
we won't go down without a fight
our voice is strong, our future's bright
and thanks to what we learned from you
we've grown into the children of the night

Left by my father with only this scar on my face
told by my mother that,
I have tasted my own hunger
sold my body to survive
some have paid to scratch the surface
but they can't touch what's inside

We are the children of the night
we won't go down without a fight
our voice is strong, our future's bright
and thanks to what we learned from you
we've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
than this life I know too well
Lord, I know I'm bound for heaven
cause I've done my time in hell

We are the children of the night
we won't go down without a fight
our voice is strong, our future's bright
and thanks to what we learned from you
we've grown into the children of the night
