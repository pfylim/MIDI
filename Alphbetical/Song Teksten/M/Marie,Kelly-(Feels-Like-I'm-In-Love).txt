Title  : FEELS LIKE I'M IN LOVE
Artist : KELLY MARIE

(Words & music: Ray Dorset)

My head is in a spin
My feet don't touch the ground
Because you're near to me
My head goes round and round

Chorus:
My knees are shakin' baby
My heart, it beats like a drum
It feels like, it feels like
I'm in love

Ain't felt this way before
But I know I'm turned on
This time it's something baby
I can't turn off

Chorus: ...

My knees shake
My heart beats like a drum
