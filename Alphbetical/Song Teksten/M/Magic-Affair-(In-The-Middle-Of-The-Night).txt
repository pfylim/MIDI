9. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT - MAGIC AFFAIR

SHOW ME THE RIGHT WAY

CHORUS:
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
A VISION BRINGS ME LIGHT
TIME IS ON MY SIDE, ALL THE WAY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
A VISION'S SHINING BRIGHT
SHOULD I GO OR SHOULD I STAY

1. RAP:
SWEAT POURS DOWN AS I TOSS AND TURN
WHILE THE DREAMS OF REALITY
STARTS TO BURN
I SEE THE VISION OF A PROPHET DRESS IN BLACK
WHEN IT SPOKE, THE VOICE BROUGHT ME BACK
WOKE UP, AND MY HANDS ARE SHAKING
A RUDE AWAKENING, BUT STILL I'M WAITING
FOR THE PICTURE TO BE REAL, OR JUST A JOKE
THEN BOOM!
MY ROOMS FILLED WITH SMOKE
SURPRISE, THE SHADOWS CAME AGAIN
THEN THE FIGURE SAID "YOU HAVE SINNED"
AS THE MESSAGE CLICKS
I'M NOT A "GETO BOY"
BUT MINDS PLAY TRICKS
A SCENARIO, THAT CARRIES YOU
BELOW TO THE DEPHT OF HELL
THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
YOU'LL FIND YOUR STRENGTH
CHOOSE A PATH AND A LYRICAL WAVELENGTH

CHORUS
(REPEAT)

2. RAP:
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE
IS WHAT I'M FACIN'
I'M OUT OF BREATH LIKE
I JUST FINISHED RACIN'
THEN A LIGHT COMES THROUGH
TO LET ME KNOW
WHICH PATH TO TAKE AND WHICH WAY TO GO
I'M KNOWIN', FLOWIN', THROWIN'
SHOWIN' GOIN CRAZY
ONCE AGAIN, YO! YOU CAN'T FAZE ME
I'M GOING ALPHA, NO OMEGA
RIGHT NOW
NOT LATER AGAINST EVIL BEHAVIOUR
TRIP DOWN UNDER, IS WHAT I PROVIDE 'EM
SANITY'S GONE, MIND ASYLUM
THEN THE VOICE COMES BACK BUT BRUTAL
TAKE GOOD AND EVIL AND MAKE IT NEUTRAL
TAKEN OUT COMP
EVIL LIES AND WALK BEATS
TAKING OUT PUNKS, BUT STILL TO SAY THE LEAST
THE JOB IS DONE, AND STILL I HAVE THE STRENGHT
FOR A NIGHT IN A LYRICAL WAVELENGTH

CHORUS
(REPEAT)
