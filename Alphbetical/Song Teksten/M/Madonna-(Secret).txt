12. Secret - Madonna

Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever gonna let it go

Bridge:
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long
To understand
How it could be until you shared your
Secret with me...

Chorus:
Something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret (secret)

You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reason why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along

What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever lovin'
Anybody else

Bridge

Chorus

Mmm-mmm something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret

Bridge

Mmm-mmm something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over
Mmm-mmm something's comin' over me
My baby's got a secret
