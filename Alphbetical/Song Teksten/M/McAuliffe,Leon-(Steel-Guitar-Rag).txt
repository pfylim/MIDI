Been runin' around,
seen many a town
so may be you'll find 
I'm the kind of guy to brag.
But listen to me and see
if you don't agree, no melody
rolls like that Steel Guitar Rag.

And when they slide
that thing along the strings,
it sounds so doggone heavenly,
your hear angels sing
an' when you start your feet,
your heart will beat
the rhythm to that Steel Guitar Rag.

You may be kind a choosy 
'bout the kind of songs you hear.
You may like songs that's bluesy
so you cry right in your beer.
But if you like a time that's bound
to drive away your care,
make happy your soul with that Steel Guitar Rag.

apron strings don't pin,
you pass my door and won't come in.
