MADONNA - THE LOOK OF LOVE

Should have left you standing
Right where you stood
Should have let you go
Should have had the sense to know
Like a train you'd come
And I'd lose my place
Now I'm on this trip
I took a fall from grace

refrain:
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
From the look of love
From the eyes of pride
Nowhere to go no place to run
From the look of love
Now I've come undone

I've had a map laid out
From the day I was born
But the roads are blocked
And the paper is worn
And all the books I've read
And things I know
Never taught me to laugh
Never taught me to let go

refrain: ...

My conscience is clear
I know right from wrong
That's a laugh I know nothing
Except that you're gone
There's more to learn
From the look in your eyes
Than a trip round this world
The stars in the sky

All the books I've read
And the things I know
Never taught me to live
Never taught me to let go

refrain: ...

Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
From the look of love
God knows I've tried
Nowhere to go no place she'll run
From the look of love
Now I've come undone
