Title  : Dear Jessie
Singer : Madonna


Baby face don't grow so fast
Make a special wish that will always last
Rub this magic latern
He will make your dreams come true for you

Ride the rainbow to the other side
Catch a falling star and then take a ride
To the river that sings and the clover that
Brings good luck to you, it's all true

Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie hear the laughter
Running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

If the land of make believe is inside your heart
It will never leave
There's a golden gate where the fairies all wait
And dancing moons, for you

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing as they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold you can never grow old
Where dreams are made up, your love parade

Pink elephants and lemonade
Dear Jessie hear the laughter
Running through the love parade
Candy kisses and a sunny day, dear Jessie
See the roses raining on the love parade

Your dreams are made inside the love parade
It's a holiday inside the love parade

On the merry-go-round of
Lovers and white turtle doves
Leprechauns floating by
This is your lullaby
Sugarplum fingertips kissing your honey lips
Close your eyes sleepy head
Is it time for your bed
never forget what I said
Hang on you're already there

Close your eyes and you'll be there
Where the mermaids sing
As they comb their hair
Like a fountain of gold
You can never grow old
Where dreams are made, your love parade
