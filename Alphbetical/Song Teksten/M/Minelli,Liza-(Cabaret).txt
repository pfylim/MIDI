2. CABARET - LIZA MINELLI 

What good is sitting alone in your room?
Come hear the music play
Life is a cabaret, old chum, come to the cabaret

Put down the knitting, the book and the broom
Time for a holiday;
Life is a cabaret, old chum, come to the cabaret

Come, taste the wine come hear the band,
Come blow the horn,
Start celebrating, right this way, your teble's waiting

No use permitting some prophet of doom
To wipe every smile away
Life is a cabaret, old chum, come to the cabaret

Come, taste the wine come hear the band,
Come blow the horn,
Start celebrating, right this way, your teble's waiting

Start by admitting from craddle to tomb, isn't that long a stay
Life is a cabaret, old chum, only a cabaret, old chum,
So come to the cabaret
