Title  : I NEVER HAD A LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE
Artist : MASSADA

(Words & music: Eppie Manuhutu/Johnny Manuhutu)

I never had a love like this before
I never had a love like this before

When I look into the magic of your eyes
I see a paradise, it's such a big surprise to me
They're telling me so much, about your magic touch
But now I see it for myself
And I'm sure that they don't tell lies

Chorus:
Sittin' here and waiting for your sun to rise
That's when I realise, life wouldn't be so nice without you
So take me through your mystic world
Things I only heard in fairy tales, oh yeah

Chorus:

When I look into the magic of your eyes
I see a paradise, it's such a big surprise to me
So if I had a song I'll sing that song for you
Many years will pass me by
But my love for you will never die, oh oh
