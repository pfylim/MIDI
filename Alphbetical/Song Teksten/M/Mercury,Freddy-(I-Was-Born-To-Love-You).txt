FREDDY MERCURY - I WAS BORN TO LOVE YOU

Refrain:
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me you're my ecstacy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love
So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream and my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe this is happening to me
An amazing feeling coming through

Refrain: ...

I wanna love you
I wanna every little thing about you
(Born) To love you
(Born) To love you every single day of my life
I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life
Every single day of my life

Refrain: ...
