IRON MAIDEN - THE EVIL THAT MEN DO

(Words & music: Smith/Dickinson/Harris)

Love is like a razor and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence
But I will pray for her
I will call her name out loud
I would bleed for her
If only I could see her now

Living on a razors edge
Balancing on a ledge
Living on a razors edge

The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on
The evil that men do lives on and on

Circle of fire my baptism of joy
At and end it seems
The seventh lamb slain
The book of life opens before me
But I will pray for you
And some day I may return
I would die for you
Beyond is where I learn
