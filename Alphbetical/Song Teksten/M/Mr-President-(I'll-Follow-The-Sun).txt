I'll follow the sun
I'll follow the sun

Dreams can make a habit
If you really let them win
We can make the world go round
There's so much to begin
I know a better place 
I need your warm embrace.

I'll follow the sun into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
I'll follow the sun
Into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
We can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)
Girl on we can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)

Follow the sun.

Take my hand
And I'll take you to a land
Where you've never been
With you by my side
I can ride to the moon
On a violin
You make me feel so right
I'm in your love tonight.

I'll follow the sun into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
I'll follow the sun
Into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
We can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)
Girl on we can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)

Sunshine lit my face
And I feel the need
Of some sunny place
Up and away
From the hustle and the bustle of the city
Where life is such a pity
I need you right here
In my arms
Underneath the shade of some sunny palms
Where the skies are blue
We can have some fun
I'll follow you like 
I'll follow the sun.

We can make the world go round
Follow the sun
We can make the world go round
Follow the...

I'll follow the sun into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
I'll follow the sun
Into energy
I'll follow the sun
(Right to the place I wanna be)
We can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)
Girl on we can make the world go round
(Why don't you follow me
Right to the place I wanna be?)

Follow the sun.
