Title  : Love Song
Singer : Madonna


Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Oh no baby my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time
Are you just being kind
Don't go givin' me one of your lines

Say what you mean
Mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run
Seem to have all the fun
But are you wasting my time-she's so fine
Are you just being kind

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
That's how I feel
Don't fog my mind

Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind
Am I losing my mind

Love song
Love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
That this is not a love song
That I want to sing


By Madonna and Prince
