Title  : MIDNIGHT DYNAMO'S

(Words & music: Steve Bloomfield)

You better beware and you better take care
When we hit the town tonight
Kick away the blues, no time to lose
Honey, we can make it right
Pretty little thing, how your heart will sing
Fill it up with pure delight
In a super charge from the gas garage explode like dynamite

We are the midnight dynamo's
Only come alive when the old moon shows
We are the midnight
Baby get a load of the fancy clothes
We are the midnight
We are the midnight, midnight dynamo's (2x)

Hurry on down, pretty mama, we're bound now
And we're really set to go
You've never been alive
Cut the fancy jive
Don't you ever tell me no

Come a come away, hear the hot band play
How they always steal the show
Gonna wear you out
Make you jump and shout
You won't have time to blow

Come a come away, hear the hot band play
How they always steal the show
Gonna wear you out
Make you jump and shout
You won't have time to blow

Any place we cruisin' people
Knows one by one
Ready packed for action fun
For all and all, for fun
