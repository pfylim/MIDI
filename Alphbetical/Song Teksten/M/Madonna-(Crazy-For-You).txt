MADONNA - CRAZY FOR YOU

Swayin' room as the music starts
Strangers makin' the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one
I see you through the smoky air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close, but still a world away
What I'm dyin' to say: you bet

Refrain:
I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true
I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you, crazy for you
Feel it in my kiss
You'll feel it in my kiss because I'm crazy for you
Touch me once and you'll know it's true

I never wanted anyone like this
It's all brand new
You'll feel it in my kiss
I'm crazy for you
Crazy for you, crazy for you
It's all brand new
I'm crazy for you
And you know it's true
I'm crazy for you

Tryin' hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye, we need no world at all
Slowly now we begin to move
Every breath I'm deeper into you
Soon we two are standing still in time
If you read my mind, you'll see

Refrain: ...
