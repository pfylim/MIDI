  4. I'LL REMEMBER (MADONNA)
  
  SAY GOODBYE
  NOT KNOWING WHEN
  THE TRUTH IN MY WHOLE LIFE BEGAN
  SAY GOODBYE
  NOT KNOWING HOW TO CRY
  YOU TAUGHT ME THAT
  
  AND I'LL REMEMBER
  THE STRENGHT THAT YOU GAVE ME
  NOW THAT I'M STANDING ON MY OWN
  I'LL REMEMBER
  THE WAY THAT YOU SAVED ME
  I'LL REMEMBER
  
  INSIDE I WAS A CHILD
  THAT COULD NOT MEND A BROKEN WING
  OUTSIDE I LOOKED FOR A WAY
  TO TEACH MY HEART TO SING
  
  AND I'LL REMEMBER
  THE LOVE THAT YOU GAVE ME
  NOW THAT I'M STANDING ON MY OWN
  I'LL REMEMBER
  THE WAY THAT YOU CHANGED ME
  I'LL REMEMBER
  
  I LEARNED
  TO LET GO
  OF THE ILLUSION
  THAT WE CAN POSSESS
  I LEARNED TO LET GO
  I TRAVEL IN STILLNESS
  I REMEMBER HAPPINESS
  I REMEMBER
  
  I'LL REMEMBER
  THE LOVE THAT YOU GAVE ME
  NOW THAT I'M STANDING ON MY OWN
  I'LL REMEMBER
  THE WAY THAT YOU CHANGED ME
  I'LL REMEMBER
  
  NOW I'LL NEVER BE AFRAID TO CRY
  NOW I FINALLY HAVE THE REASON WHY
  I'LL REMEMBER
  (REPEAT TO END)
