NIGHTS IN WHITE SATIN - THE MOODY BLUES


Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send.

Beauty I've always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you (ah...).

Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through
They can't understand.

Some try to tell me
Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be
You will be in the end
And I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you (ah...)
Oh, how I love you.

Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written
Never meaning to send.

Beauty I've always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you. (ah...)
Oh, how I love you (ah...)
Oh.

'Cause I love you
Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you. (ah...)
Oh, how I love you (ah...).
