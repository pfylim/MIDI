Title  : REMEMBER YESTERDAY

(Words & music: John Miles)

Misty silence in the early morning
All around another day is dawning
Goodbyes ain't easy
So no one sees me when I go

Only time is gonna last forever
Just remember what we had together
I must be leaving
And I can't even let it show

I am on my way
Remember yesterday

Use your mem'ry in a thousand places
Disappearing in a sea of faces
Always lovely
I live the only way I know

Holding on until I don't remember
Early morning backing late September
Now you're behind me
The clouds remind me I'm alone

And I am on my way
Remember yesterday

My mind must be the gipsy that keeps me moving on
My heart must be the only thing that's calling me back home
My memories are souvenirs and all there is to show
For someone who's been ev'rywhere, I got no place to go
