Singer : MEAT LOAF 
Title  : PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT

(Words & music: Jim Steinman)

I remember every little thing
As if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake
And there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl
Looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school
They were wishing they were me that night

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold tight
C'mon, hold tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Ain't no doubt about it
Baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

Baby doncha here my heart
You got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long
For you to come along and have some fun

And I gotta let ya know
No you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes I got a big surprise
It'll feel all right
Well I wanna make your motor run

And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon, hold tight
C'mon, hold tight

Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light

You gotta do what you can
And let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it
We were doubly blessed
'Cause we were barely seventeen
And we were barely dressed

We're gonna go all the way tonight
We're gonna go all the way
And tonight's the night
(3x)

Stop right there
I gotta know right now
Before we go any further
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever
Do you need me
Will you never leave me
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life
Will you take me away and make me your wife?
Do you love me?
Will you love me forever
Do you need me
Will you never leave me
Will you make me so happy
For the rest of my life
Will you take me away and make me your wife?

Let me sleep on it
Baby baby let me sleep on it
Let me sleep on it
I'll give you an answer in the morning
(3x)

I couldn't take it any longer
Lord I was crazy
And when the feeling came upon me
Like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my god
And on my mother's grave
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time

So now I'm praying for the end of time
To hurry up and arrive
'Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you
I don't think that I can really survive
I never break my promise or forget my vow
But God only knows what I can do right now
I'm praying for the end of time
It's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time
So I can end my time with you
