Title  : Keep It Together
Singer : Madonna


Keep, keep it together, keep people together
Forever and ever

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of our history
Brother and sisters they hold the key
Tou your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I got brothers, I got some sisters too
Stuck in the middle tell you what I,m gonna do
Gonna get our of here, I,m gonna leave this place
So I can forget every single hungry face
I'm tired of sharing all the hand me downs
To get attention I must always be the clown
I wanna be different, I wanna be on my own
But Daddy said listen, you will always have a home

Keep it together in the family
They're a reminder of our history
Brothers and sisters they hold the key
To your heart and your soul
Don't forget that your family is gold

I hit the big time but I still get the blues
Everyone's a stranger, city life can get to you
People can be so cold, never want to turn your back
Jus't givin' to get something
Always wanting something back
When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters, they're always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be

When I look back on all the misery
And all the heartache that they brought to me
I wouldn't change it for another chance
'Cause blood is thicker than any other cirumstance

When I get lonely and I need to be
Loved for who I am, not what they want to see
Brothers and sisters they've always been there for me
We have a connection, home is where the heart should be
