                             MANDY

     As performed by: Barry Manilow


     I remember all my life, raining down as cold as ice
     shadows of a man, a face through a window
     cryin' in the night, the night goes into......

     Mornin' just another day, happy people pass my way
     lookin' in their eyes, I see a memory
     I never realised, how happy you made me

     Oh Mandy.....well you came and you gave without takin'
     but I sent you away, oh Mandy.....well you kissed me
     and stopped me from shakin', and I need you today...oh Mandy

     BRIDGE...................

     I'm standin' on the edge of time, I walked away when love was mine
     caught up in a world of uphill climbin', the tears are in my eyes
     and nothin' is rhymin

     Oh Mandy.....well you came and you gave without takin'
     but I sent you away, oh Mandy.....well you kissed me
     and stopped me from shakin', and I need you today...oh Mandy

     BRIDGE......................

     Yesterday's a dream, I face the mornin'.....
     cryin' on a breeze, the pain is callin'

     Oh Mandy.....well you came and you gave without takin'
     but I sent you away, oh Mandy.....well you kissed me
     and stopped me from shakin', and I need you today...

     Oh Mandy....you came and you gave without takin'
     but I sent you away, oh Mandy.....you kissed me
     and stopped me from shakin', and I need.........you
