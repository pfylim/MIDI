Where's your momma gone,
where's your momma gone,
little baby Don,
little baby Don,
where's your poppa gone,
where's your poppa gone,
far, far away,
far, far away.

Last night I heard my momma singin' a song:
Ooh wee Chirpy Chirpy, Cheep Cheep,
woke up this mornin' and my momma was gone,
ooh wee Chirpy Chirpy, Cheep Cheep,
Chirpy Chirpy, Cheep Cheep Chirp.

Where's your momma gone,
where's your momma gone,
little baby Don,
little baby Don,
where's your momma gone,
where's your momma gone,
where's your poppa gone,
where's your poppa gone,
far, far away,
far, far away.
