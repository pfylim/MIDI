Title  : The Joker
Singer : Steve Miller Band


Some people call me the space cowboy
Some call me the gangster of love
Some people cal me Mourice
Cause I speak out the Pompatus of love
People talk about me baby
Say I'm doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong
But don't worry baby
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home
'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a griner
I'm a lover and I'm a sinner
Play my music in the sun

I'm a joker, I'm a smoker
I'm a midnight toker
I sure don't want to hurt no one

You're the cutest thing I ever did see
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Come on baby, I'll show you a real good time
