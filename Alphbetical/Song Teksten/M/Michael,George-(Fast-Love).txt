1. FAST LOVE - GEORGE MICHAEL

You gotta get up, get down.
...

Looking for some education.
Made my way into the night.
All that bullshit conversation.
Baby can't you read the signs?

I won't bore you with the detail baby.
I don't even wannna waste your time.
Let's just say that maybe
You could help to ease my mind.
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right.

But if you're looking for fastlove.
If that's love in your eyes.
It's more than enough.
Had some bad luck.
Some fastlove is all 
That I've got on my mind.

Ooh ooh, baby baby
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh ooh, baby baby
What's there to think about baby?
Ooh ooh, baby baby
Oh yeah.
Ooh ooh, baby baby
You gotta get up.
You gotta get up.

Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
They're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun

I won't bore you with the detail baby.
You gotta get there 
In your own sweet time.
Let's just say that maybe.
You could help to ease my mind.
Baby, I ain't Mr. Right.

But if you're looking for fastlove.
If that's love in your eyes.
It's more than enough.
Had some bad luck.
Some fastlove is all 
That I've got on my mind.

Ooh ooh, baby baby
Ooh, yeah yeah
Ooh ooh, baby baby
What's there to think about baby?
Ooh ooh, baby baby
Get yourself arrested for love.
Ooh ooh, baby baby
You gotta get up.
You gotta get up.

So close
I can taste it now baby
So close

In the absence of security.
I made my way into the night.
Stupid Cupid keeps on calling me.
But I see nothing in his eyes.
I miss my baby, oh yeah.
I miss my baby tonight.
So why don't we make a little room.
In my BMW babe.
Searchin' for some peace of mind.
Hey, I'll help you find it.
I do believe that we are 
Practicing the same religion.

Oh you really oughta get up now.
That's right that`s right
Oh you really oughta get up.

You gotta get up, get down.
You gotta get up, get down.
Oh yeah
You gotta get up, get down.
You gotta get up, get down.
Oh yeah
You gotta get up, get down.
You gotta get up, get down.
Oh yeah
You gotta get up, get down.
You gotta get up, get down.
Oh yeah

Looking for some affirmation, affirmation.
You gotta get up, get down.
