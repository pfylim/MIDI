MODERN TALKING - GERONIMO'S CADILLAC

(Words & music: Dieter Bohlen)

I wanna share my dreams, wanna share with you
On the wings of love, like dreamers do
Touch your heart, you're the queen of broken hearts
Oh we are daytime friends, and nighttime fools
Wanna play this game, you brake the rules
Tears of love, are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac, is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, it's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning, it's burning 
It makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning, it's burning 
It makes you sad

I'm looking thru the eyes, the eyes of love
Mad a fool of me, can't get enough
Touch my heart, boulevard of broken dreams
Another time for love, other place to be
Don't let him take your love, your love from me
Tears of love, are frozen tears

Geronimo's Cadillac, is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
Geronimo's Cadillac, it's tossing oh in your head
It's tossing and turning, it's burning 
It makes you mad
Geronimo's Cadillac, oh baby I'll hold you back
It's tossing and turning, it's burning 
It makes you sad

Geronimo's Cadillac, is making all girls too mad
Geronimo has a heart, oh it's a drag
