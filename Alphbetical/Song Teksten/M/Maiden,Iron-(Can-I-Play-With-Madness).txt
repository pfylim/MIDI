CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS - IRON MAIDEN


Can i play with madness

Give me the sense to wonder to wonder if im free
give me a sense to wonder to know i can be me
give me the strength to hold my head up
spit back in their face
don't need no key to unlock this door
gonna break dwon the walls
break out of this bad place

Refrain:
   Can i play with madness
   the prophet stared at his crystal ball
   can i play with madness
   there's no vision there at all
   can i play with madness
   the prophet looked and he laughed at me he said
   can i play with madness
   he said you're blind to blind to see

He said you're to blind to see
i screamed aloud to the old man i said
don't lie don't say you don't know
i say you'll play for your mischief
in this world or the next
the he fixed me with a freezing glance and the hell
fires raged in his eyes
he said do you wanna know the truth son lord
i'll tell you the truth your soul's gonna
burn in a lake of fire

Refrain

Listen to me said the prophett

Refrain

   and the sun shines daily on the way
   I took a trip on a sailing ship
   and when I reached Jamaica I made a stop
