GARY MOORE & PHIL LYNOTT - OUT IN THE FIELDS

It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal 'til the victory is won
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Refrain:
Out in the field
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag or uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Refrain: ...

There's no communication no-one to take the blame
The cries of every nation have fallen on deaf ears again
Out in the fields
Out in the fields
They are falling one by one
Out in the fields
No flag or uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields
A heartbeat away
Out in the fields
Death is just a heartbeat away
Out in the fields
A heartbeat away
Out in the fields

In the fields
The fighting has begun
Out on the streets
They're falling one by one
A heartbeat away
Out from the skies
A thousand more will die each day out
