  I'D DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE (MEAT LOAF)
  
  And I would do anything for love
  I'd run right into hell and back
  I would do anything for love
  I'll never ..
  
  But I'll never forget the way you feel right now -
  Oh no - no way -
  I would do anything for love
  But I won't do that
  I won't do that
  Anything for love
  I would do anything for love
  I would do anything for love
  But I won't do that
  I won't do that
  Some days it don't come easy
  Some days it don't come hard
  Some days it don't come at all
  and these are the days that never end
  
  Some nights you're breathing tire
  Some nights you're earved in ice
  Some nights you're like nothing I've ever seen before
  Or  will again
  
  May be
  I would do anything for love
  I would do anything for love
  I would do anything for love
  I would do anything for love
