Title  : COULD YOU BE LOVED
Artist : BOB MARLEY & THE WAILERS

(Words & music: Bob Marley/A. Sadkin)

Could you be loved and be loved (2x)
Don't let them fool you
Or even try to school you, oh no
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right
Love would never leave us alone
In the darkness there must come out to light
Could you be loved and be loved(2x)

The road of life is rocky
And you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers
Someone else is judging you
Love your brotherman
Could you be (2x), could you be loved

Don't let them change you
Or even rearrange you, oh no
We've got a life to live
They say only , only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive
Could you be loved and be loved (2x)
You ain't gonna miss your water
Until your well runs dry
No matter how you treat him
The man will never be satisfied
Could you be (2x), could you be loved
Could you be, could you be loved (2x)

Say something (4x)
Reggae, reggae
Say something
Rockers, rockers
Say something: could you be loved
