12. Up'n Away - Mr. President

Up'n away
Up'n away
Souls may fly visions blurred
He badly needs that attracts to her
Although a storm as I tell
Smackin' some fuzz on the bed well
Blast and blaze he won't see it
If you make gags the way it is
It's damn for knockin'
My subliminal name's Sunruffin
My first success from the stars
has torn me and my flame apart
But there's a creation my man
That brings us back together again

Chorus:
Up'n away
We need a place to hide
(Gonna get up gonna get up)
Up'n away
We're gonna fly so high
(Gonna get up gonna get up)
I want to get away
(Want to get up and get away)
I want to get away
(Want to get up and get away)
I want to get away
(Want to get up and get away)
I want to get away
(Gonna get up gonna get up)
Up'n away

Second to minutes made its form
As I was from day always up to weeks
Down from the crumbling town lift
Been down through the Alplaza's speed
Europe and America
Thousands of miles just between the two creations of man
I can fly won't bring me back to you
No more sad times
Our passion will return today
Tonight I will feel you
'Cause I can fly up and away

Chorus

Finally we've been asked to ship into a gas of climax
Everywhere there's deep in snow
Just do it and stuff just found the path floor
Not a flame of flow has hit you
So I say you best remember
Before the bell will keep you high
You'll be A.N.D. A.W.A.Y.

Chorus
