Title  : L'L'LUCY

Lucy's a woman who lives just for kicks
And I guess I'll never change her
Does what she wants to
She knows all the tricks
No I'll never re-arrange her

La la Lucy la la Lucy
I'm telling you what you gonna do
La la Lucy la la Lucy
It's all over for you
Don't you know that's true
Because you know I told you once before
No messing or you're out that door
I mean it and meant it then
Ain't gonna take you woman back again
La la la Lucy la la la Lucy
It's all over for you
Don't you know that's true

Her time will come when she's out on her own
Then she won't have me to depend on
Then she'll find out as she sits all alone
She's got no one to lean on

La la Lucy la la Lucy
I'm telling you what you gonna do
La la Lucy
It's all over for you
Don't you know that's true
You know I told you once before
No messing or you're out that door
I mean it and meant it then
Ain't gonna take you woman

Back again ain't gonna take you woman
Back again
La la Lucy la la la Lucy
I'm telling you what you gonna do
