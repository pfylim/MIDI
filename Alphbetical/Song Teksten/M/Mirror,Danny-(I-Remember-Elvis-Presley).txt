Spoken:
Last night I turned on the radio for the midnight news
Suddenly I thought I died of a broken heart
When I heard the announcer say
The great rock singer, Elvis Presley, also known
as The King, just died in a hospital in Memphis
Tennessee, U.S.A. at the age of 42 years

I remember Elvis Presley
Lord, how I loved to hear him sing
So I'll adore him, just forever
For he's the one and only King

I remember Elvis Presley
And he won't ever set me free
Like he was singing Now Or Never
He's just a golden memory

Good Luck Charm is not forever
Good luck songs, we need them ever
Again, again, I'll play your songs
'Cause in my mind you haven't gone

Are you lonesome tonight ...

I remember Elvis Presley
Lord, I love to hear him sing

I remember Elvis Presley
And he won't ever set me free

My dear friend, I won't forget you
When I need you, I can hear you
King though I don't know where or when
There'll be a day we meet again

Can't help falling in love ...

Spoken:
Elvis Presley, I wanna thank you for all the
Happiness you gave
So many people all over the world, during many
Many years
Ha, I remember the disk-jockey, was playing
Jailhouse rock when
I had my first date with a beautiful girl
And since that evening
You've been my friend, Elvis

I remember Elvis Presley
Lord, how I love to hear him sing
So I'll adore him just forever
He's just a golden memory
