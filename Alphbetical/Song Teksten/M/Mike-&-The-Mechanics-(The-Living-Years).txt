THE LIVING YEARS

Every Generation blames the one before
And all of their frustrations
come beating on your door
I know that I'm a prisoner to all
my father held so dear
I know that I'm a hostage
to all his hopes and fears
I just wish I could have told him
in the living years
--------------------------------------------------------
More crumpled bits of paper
filled with imperfect thoughts
Stilted conversations
I'm afraid that's all we've got
You say you just don't
see it, he says it's perfect sense
You just can't get agreement
in this present tense
We all talk a different language,
talking in defence
--------------------------------------------------------
Say it loud, say it clear, you can
listen as well as you hear
It's too late when we die to admit
we don't see eye to eye
--------------------------------------------------------
So we open up a quarrel
between the present and the past
We only sacrifice the future,
it's the bitterness that lasts
so don't yield
to the fortunes you
sometimes see as fate
It may have a new perspective
on a different date
And if you don't give up and don't give in
you may just be okay
--------------------------------------------------------
I wasn't there that morning
when my father passed away
I didn't get to tell him
all the things I had to say
But I think I caught its spirit
later that same year
I'm sure I heard his echo in
my baby's new-born tears
I just wish I could have told him
in the living years
