
   Black Velvet            Alannah Myles


Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell,
Jimmie Rodgers on the Victr'ia up high.
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder,
The sun is settin' like molases in the sky.
The boy could sing, knew how to move evrything,
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.

Black velvet and that little boy smile,
Black velvet with that slow southern style.
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees.
Black velvet if you please.

Up in Memphis the music's like a heat wawe.
White lightnin' bound to drive you wild.
Mama's baby is in the heart of ev'ry school girl.
Love me tender leaves'em cryin' the aisle.
The way he moved it was so, so sweet and true.
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for.


Ev'ry word of ev'ry song that he sang was for you.
In a flash he was gone it happened so soon,
What could you do ?
