Title  : Cherish
Singer : Madonna


So tired of broken hearts, of losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny, I can't let go baby
Can't you see
Cupid please take your aim at me

Cherish the tought
Of always having you here by my side
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Perish the thought
Of ever learning I never would

I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide the need for two hearts that bleed with burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

Cherish the tought
Of always having you here by my side
Cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
Cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
Perish the thought
Of ever learning I never would

Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of 
... your love

Romeo and Juliet never felt this way I bet

So don't  underestimate my point of view

Give me strength
Give me joy my boy
I will always
Cherish you


By Madonna and Patrick Leonard
