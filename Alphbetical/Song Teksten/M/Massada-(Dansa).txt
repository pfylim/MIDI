(Words & music: Massada)

Just keep your body moving
To the rhythm that we make
Will give you latin fever
You can feel it 'cause it ain't no fake

Dansa, don't quit dancing
The time for joy is now
If you don't know how to get it
We're the ones to show you how

So let our music take you
To a land of latin swing
We want you all to join us
To jump around and do your thing

Dansa, don't quit dancing
Let your sorrow in the past
If you don't know how to do it
We will show you how at last
