Singer : THE MONOTONES
Title  : MONO

(Words & music: Edwards/Fleischer)

Way back in the twenties
A very clever turkey found a way
To bring the people music, the radio
He called it: hey hey
Come on grils
Put your headphones on
Dab dab di doo dah, dab dab di doo dah
Hifi stereo headphones
Stop it, I can't control it

Chorus:
Dab dab di doo dah, dab dab di doo dah
Ultra high and ultra low
Mono, mono
I'm looking for a way to get back
Mono, mono
The music of today is just a drag

I still recall the fifties
When rock and roll was heavy
It was fine
My head looked like a lolly
Just like Buddy Holly
What a time
Dab dab di doo dah, dab dab di doo dah
Rumble wow and flutter
I don't care just like my mother

Chorus: ...

Listen, listen
Since I've got a girlfriend
Disco comes to no end I get mad
Hi hoo hoo hah hah
When I hear Perry Como
It really drives me mono
I feel sad
Dab dab di doo dah, dab dab di doo dah
Hifi stereo headphones
Stop I can't control it

Chorus: ...

This record can be played on every modern
Lightweight pick-up
The stereo sound however can be reproduced
only when stereo equipement is used

Chorus: ...
