There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes
I swear I won't tease you
   won't tell you lies
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes
I waited so long baby now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ands
I want your sex
I want your sex
I want your sex
I want your sex
It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken to much time
So why don't you just let me go
I'd really like to try
Oh I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
When I tell you that I love you
   but you still say no
I swear I won't tease you
   won't tease you no lies
I don't need no bible just lood in my eyes
I've waited so long baby out in the cold
I can't take much more
   girl I'm losing control
I want your sex
I want your sex
I want your sex
I want your sex
Sex
It's natural it's chemical (let's do it)
It's logical habitual (can we do it)
It's sensual but most of all
Sex is something we should do 
Sex is something for me and you
Sex is natural Sex is good
Not everybody does it but everybody should
Sex is natural Sex is fun 
Sex is best when it's one on one
One on one
(Huh Sex) I'm not your father
(Huh Sex) I'm not your brother
(Huh Sex) Talk to your sister
(Huh Sex) I am a lover
(Huh Sex huh Sex huh Sex)
C-c-c-c-come on (Huh)
What's your definition of dirty baby 
What do you consider pornography
Don't you know I love you 'till 
   it hurts me baby
Don't you think it's time
   you had sex with me
Sex with me sex with me
Have sex with me (Huh)
C-c-c-c-come on
