Title  : Praying For Time
Singer : George Michael


These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last to look around now
These are the days of beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much but we take our chances
'Cause God stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there's no hope to speak of and the
wounded skies above.
Say it's much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the open hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear
Twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much, but I'll take my chances

'Cause God stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for.
