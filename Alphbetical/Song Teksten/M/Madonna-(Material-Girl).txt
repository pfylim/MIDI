MADONNA - MATERIAL GIRL


Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light, that's right
'Cause the boy with the cold, hard cash
Always Mister Right

Refrain:
'Cause we're living in a material world
And I'm a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I'm a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's alright with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play
Only boys that save their pennies
Make my rainy day

Boys may come and boys may go
And that's alright you see
Experience has made me rich
And now they're after me

Refrain: ...
