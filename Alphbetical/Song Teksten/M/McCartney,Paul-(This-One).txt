Title  : This One
Singer : Paul McCartney


Did I ever take you in my arms
Look you in the eye tell you that I do
Did I ever open my heart
And let you look inside

Chorus:
If I ever did it I was only waiting
For a better moment that didn't come
There never could be a better moment
Than this one, this one
The swan is gliding above the ocean
A god is riding upon his back
How calm the water and bright the rainbow
Fade this one to black

Did I ever touch you on the check
Say that you were mine, thank you for the smile
Did I ever knock upon your door
And try to get inside?

Chorus

What opportunities did we allow to fly by
Feeling like the timing wasn't quite right?
What kind of magic might have worked if we had stayed calm
Couldn't I have given you a better life?

Did you ever take me in your arms
Look me in the eye tell me that you do?
Did I ever open my heart
Let me look inside?

Chorus
