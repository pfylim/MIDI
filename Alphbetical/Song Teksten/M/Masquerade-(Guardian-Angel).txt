  5. GUARDIAN ANGEL - Masquerade
  
  I feel I'm falling apart
  'Cause I know I've lost my guardian angel
  I'm feeling glints off your heart
  Losing right from the start
  No return
  And things will never be the same.
  
  I feel I'm falling apart
  'Cause I know I've lost my guardian angel
  I'm feeling glints off your heart
  Losing right from the start
  No return
  And things will never be the same.
  
  Try to find the words
  That show I sympathise 
  Words of comfort
  Words that never criticise
  Though I know 
  You're simply laughing at me
  I just can't stop 
  And simply let it be.
  
  Wow wow wow
  Where are all those feelings
  Of my yesterday
  Feelings now I have
  Bring back those good old ways
  Though I know you want
  To turn and flow
  I just can't stop 
  And simply let you go.
  
  I feel I'm falling apart
  'Cause I know I've lost my guardian angel
  I'm feeling glints off your heart
  Losing right from the start
  No return
  And things will never be the same.
  
  Let me see you smile
  Once more that special way (let me see you smile)
  Warm as summer
  On a chilly winter's day
  Though I know 
  You're simply laughing at me
  I just can't stop 
  And simply let it be.
  
  I feel I'm falling apart
  'Cause I know I've lost my guardian angel
  I'm feeling glints off your heart
  Losing right from the start
  No return
  And things will never be the same.
