MODERN TALKING - ATLANTIS IS CALLING (SOS FOR LOVE)

Lady I know it's hard
But it's much harder to ignore
There is a chance and I'll promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights we're romancing
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere oh baby there is some one
Oh you're dancing in my mind

Refrain:
Oh oh oh little queenie I'm your fool
Come on teach me the rules
I will send an sos for love
Oh oh oh little queenie I'm your fool
You need love, like I do
I will send an sos for love
Atlantis is calling - sos for love
Atlantis is calling - from the stars above
Atlantis is calling - sos for love
Atlantis is calling - it's too hot to stop

If lovin' you is wrong babe
Oh I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin babe
And baby hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I wait a million years for you
I love you more than I'm sayin'
Baby that's for me the truth

Refrain: ...
