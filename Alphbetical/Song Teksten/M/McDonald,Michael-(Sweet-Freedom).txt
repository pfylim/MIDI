MICHAEL McDONALD - SWEET FREEDOM

No more runnin' down the wrong road
Dancin' to a different drum
Can't you see what's goin' on
Deep inside your heart
Always searchin' for the real thing
But livin' like it's far away
Just leave all the madness in yesterday
You're holdin' the key, when you believe it

Refrain:
Shine sweet freedom shine your light on me
You are the magic, you're right where I wanna be
Oh sweet freedom, carry me along
We'll keep the spirit alive
On and on

We'll be dancin' in the moonlight
Smilin' with the risin' sun
Livin' like we've never done
Goin' all the way
Reachin' out to meet the changes
Touchin' every shinin' star
The light of tomorrow is right
where we are
There's no turnin' back from what I'm feelin'

Refrain: ...

'Cause there'll be starlight, all night
When we're close together
Share those feelin's dancin' in your eyes
Tonight
They're guidin' us
Shinin' till the mornin' light

Refrain: ...
