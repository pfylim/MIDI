Title  : BON BON VIE
Artist : T.S. MONK

(Words & music: S. Linzer/R. Russel Brown)

I don't like those games people are playin'
Playin' ball off the wall with my head
The man promised me a raise
Who's gonna raise me when I'm dead?
Oh, I'm so tired of punchin' that clock every day
Always skating on thin ice
Lord knows we could use a holiday, baby
Just the two of us would be so nice

Chorus:
Gimme the bon, gimme the bon bon
Gimme the bon bon bon bon bon bon vie
Gimme the good life
Give it a me
Gimme the bon bon bon bon bon bon vie
Gimme the good life
Oooh, baby

We were born and raised in New York City
Fell in love in Central Park
I really love New York City
Still number one on my heart
But sometimes I feel like a stranger here
Used and abused and forgot
Sometimes I feel like no one would really
Give a damn if I dropped dead right here on the spot

Chorus: ...

Let's go out on the town tonight
Pretty baby
Dance till the sun comes up
We'll have Dom Perignon till our minds are blown
And put our last dime in that blind man's cup

Chorus: ...
