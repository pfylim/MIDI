  4. I GOT TO GIVE UP (MASTERBOY)
  
  GET AWAY
  
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  OUR LOVE IS OUT OF SIGHT
  NO MATTER IF IT'S WRONG OR IF IT'S RIGHT
  THIS AIN'T NO MATTER OF FIGHTING PEOPLE
  GET THIS IN YOUR HEAD TONIGHT 
  I LOVED YOU ONCE A LONG TIME AGO
  BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING FAST
  YOU ASKED ME ONCE
  YOU ASKED ME TWICE
  BUT STILL I WILL SAY NO
  
  STOP! I GOT TO GET AWAY
  NO MORE WORDS FOR ME TO SAY
  MY LOVE FOR YOU IS DEAD AND GONE
  YOU NEED THIS PLACE ALL ALONE
  
  BODY AND YOUR FINGERS TOUCH
  THEY DROVE ME ONCE INSANE
  BUT NOW I'LL TELL YOU: THAT'S A FACT
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  SORRY FOR THIS HURTING STATEMENT
  FUEL BURNED OUT TO THE GROUND
  NO MORE COMPROMISE AT ALL
  CAN BRING ME BACK AROUND
  
  HEARTS ARE BURNING EVERYWHERE
  BUT WAR TO KILL THE FLAMING MIND
  THE LIGHTNING IN MY FIELD IS OFF
  CAN'T HAVE MORE OF MY TIME
  
  DREAM OF LIFE TIME LOST
  BEING GOOD TO YOU BUT NOT TO ME
  YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME ALL YOUR LIFE
  THIS CAN'T BE, CAN'T YOU SEE
  
  STAY TILL BIGGER DAWN
  KISS ME, HUG ME ON AND ON
  YOU WILL SEE NEXT DAY
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GIVE IT UP
  I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  GIVE ME WHAT I NEED
  GIVE ME WHAT YOU WANT
  BUT I GOT TO GET AWAY
  
  GET AWAY.
