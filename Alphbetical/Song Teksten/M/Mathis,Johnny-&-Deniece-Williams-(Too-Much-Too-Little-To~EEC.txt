Singer : JOHNNY MATHIS & DENIECE WILLIAMS 
Title  : TOO MUCH, TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

(Words & music: Nat Kipner/John Vallins)

(Johnny)
Guess it's over, call it a day
Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end someday, this way

(Deniece)
Guess it's over, the kicks are gone
What's the use of trying to hang on?
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me
And it's clear to see

Chorus:
Too much, too little, too late
To lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late
To try again with you
We're in the middle of ending
Something that we knew, was over
Oh, it was over
Too much, too little, too late
To ever try again
Too much, too little, too late
Let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late
We knew it had to end
Oh, it's over, it's over

(Deniece)
Guess it's over, the chips are down
Pity all our bridges tumbled down
Were there a chance, we'd try

Chorus: ...
