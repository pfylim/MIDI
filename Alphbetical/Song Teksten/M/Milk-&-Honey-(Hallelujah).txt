Singer : MILK & HONEY 
Title  : HALLELUJAH

(Words & music: Shimrit Orr/Kobi Oshrat)

Hallelujah, sing a song
Hallelujah, we'll follow along
With a simple word to sing
A singing word
We bless the sky and treat the birds
And we fill our hearts with joy
Hallelujah

Chorus:
Hallelujah, sounds of love
Hallelujah, the sunshine above
Hallelujah, the bells will go ringing
And dinging from dawn to night
Hallelujah

Hallelujah, day by day
Hallelujah, don't throw it away
Fly and spread your wings
And try to be free again like a butterfly
Come along and sing with us, hallelujah

Chorus: ...

Hallelujah, hand in hand
Hallelujah, all over the land
Let's try from the start
And sing it with all of us
Hallelujah
