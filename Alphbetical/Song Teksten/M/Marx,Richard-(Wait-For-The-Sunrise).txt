I was born an only son
didn't take to the rules, like a normal child
prisoner of things I've done
it's the price you pay livin' fast and wild

I've spent to many nights
lookin' over my shoulder
and the ways of the world make a heart
grow colder
got nowhere left to hide
the fight in me has died
so I must wait for the sunrise

Friend to fear and loaded gun
live life like the owner of a heart of stone
no one touches, touch no one
but the roads get weary when you're all alone

I've spent to many nights
lookin' over my shoulder
and the ways of the world make a heart
grow colder
got nowhere left to hide
the fight in me has died
so I must wait for the sunrise

Too much done too undo
no one I can run to
I need one more chance to live my life again

I've spent to many nights
lookin' over my shoulder
and the ways of the world make a heart
grow colder
got nowhere left to hide
the fight in me has died
so I must wait for the sunrise

I've spent to many nights
lookin' over my shoulder
and the ways of the world make a heart
grow colder
got nowhere left to hide
the fight in me has died
so I must wait for the sunrise
