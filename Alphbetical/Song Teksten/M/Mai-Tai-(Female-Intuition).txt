MAI TAI - FEMALE INTUITION

I hardly even knew you, you called me on the phone
You take me to a movie, now you wanna drive me home
I won't deny I like it (but) you push it just a bit too hard

You tell me that you love me, I've heard it all before
I really like your stories, but now I'm gonna shut the door
So don't put your arm around me confusion is in my heart

Well you see I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much

Refrain:
It's my female intuition
Protects me against your charms
But drives me into your arms
My female intuition
The woman in me does some checkin'
On the man in you

All the girls they tell me, tell me you're no good
Guess they are so jealous, other I don't think they would
But there's a voice inside me, tellin' me not to let go

It's a competition, all the girls in town
I'll use my ammunition, 'cause I wanna wear the crown
So you best believe me, boy I'm gonna tie you down

Well you see I can't defend against your touch
I'm afraid I got to like you a little too much

Refrain: ...(2x)...

Lovers come and lovers go, it's something every woman knows
Ever since you came my way, I'm doing everything to make
you stay

Refrain: ...
