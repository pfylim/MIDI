Title  : BAGGY TROUSERS
Artist : MADNESS

(Words & music: G. McPersons/C. Foreman/ M. Barson)

Naughty boys in nasty schools
Headmaster's breaking all the rules
Having fun and playing fools
Smashing up the woodwork tools
All the teachers in the pub
Passing round the ready rub
Trying not to think of when
The lunchtime bell will ring again

Chorus:
Oh, what fun we had
But did it really turn out bad
All I learnt at school
Was how to bend, not break the rules
Oh, what fun we had
But at the time it seemed so bad
Trying different ways to
Make a difference to (the days)

The headmaster's had enough today
All the kids have gone away
Gon to fight with next door's school
Every term that is the rule
Sits alone and bends his cane
Same old backsides again
All the small ones tell tall tales
Walking home and squashing snails

Chorus: ...

Lots of girls and lots of boys
Lots of smells and lots of noise
Playing football in the park
Kicking pushbikes after dark
Baggy trousers, dirty shirts
Pulling hair and eating dirt
Teacher comes to break it up
Back of the head with a plastic cup

Chorus: ...

Baggy trousers (3x)
