                   DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA

            It won't be easy, you'll think it strange

            when I try to explain how I feel
            
            that I still need your love after all that I've done

            You won't believe me

            All you will see is a girl you once knew

            Although she's dressed up to the nines,

            at sixes and sevens with you

            
            I had to let it happen, I had to change

            Couldn't stay all my life down at heel

            Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun

            So I chose freedom

            Running around trying everything new
            
            But nothing impressed me at all, I never expected it too

            DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA

            THE TRUTH IS, I NEVER LEFT YOU

            ALL TRHOUGH MY WILD DAYS, MY MAD EXISTENCE,

            I KEPT MY PROMISE, DON'T KEEP YOUR DISTANCE

            And as for fortune and as for fame

            I never invented them in

            though it seemed to the world they were all I desired

            They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised

            to be, the answer was here all the time

            I love you and hope you love me

            REFREIN 

            Have I said to much there's more I can think of to say to you

            But all you have to do, is to look at me 

            to know every word is true
