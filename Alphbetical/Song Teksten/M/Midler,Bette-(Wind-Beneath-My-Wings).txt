  It must have been cold there in my shadow

  To never have sunlight on your face

  You are content to let me shine, that's your way

  You always walked the stairs behind


  So I was the one with all the glory
  
  While you were the one with all the strenght

  A beautiful face without a name, for so long

  A beautiful smile that hide the pain


  DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU'RE MY HERO, AND EVERYTHING I WOULD LIKE TO BE

  I COULD FLY HIGHER THAN AN EAGLE, YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS

  
  It might have appeared to go unnoticed

  But I've got it all here in my heart

  I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it

  I would be nothing without you

  REFREIN

  DID I EVER TELL YOU YOU'RE MY HERO ( nee, dat wist ik niet.......)

  YOU'RE EVERYTHING, EVERYTHING I WISH I COULD BE (doe dan eens je best...)

  OOOH AND I, I COULD FLY HIGHER THAN AN EAGLE  (geen hoogtevrees,schatje??)

  FOR YOU ARE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS  (2X) (en wat voor 'wings'.......)

  
  - ooooh wind beneath my wings, you ,you, you,

    you are the wind beneath my wings

    flyyyyyyyyy   flyyyyyyyyyyyy   flyyyyy away, you let me fly so high

    you, you, you ,  you're  the wind beneath my wings (2X)

    flyyyyyyyy   flyyyyyyyyyy  fly higher than the stars

    so high I almost touched the sky, thank you, thank you

    Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings
