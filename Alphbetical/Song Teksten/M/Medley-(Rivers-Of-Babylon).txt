  (RIVERS OF BABYLON)
  BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON
  WHERE WE SAT DOWN
  YEAH WE WEPT
  WHEN WE REMEMBERED SION
  (REPEAT 1 TIME)
  
  EVER MAKE IT
  
  CARRY US AWAY IN CAPTIVITY
  REQUIRED OF US A SONG
  NOW HOW SHALL WE SING THE LORD'S SONG
  IN A STRANGE LAND
  
  (SUNNY)
  SUNNY, YESTERDAY MY LIFE WAS FILLED WITH RAIN
  SUNNY, SMILE AT ME AND REALLY EASE THE PAIN
  THE DARK DAYS HAVE GONE
  AND THE BRIGHT DAYS ARE HERE
  MY SUNNY, ONCE SHINED SO SINCERE
  SUNNY, ONCE SO TRUE I LOVE YOU

  (RASPUTIN)
  THERE WAS A CERTAIN MAN IN RUSSIA LONG AGO
  HE WAS BIG AND STRONG AND HIS EYES WERE FLAMING GOLD
  HE SPOKE A LITTLE TUNE WITH TERROR AND FEAR
  BUT TO MOSCOW CHIEFS HE WAS SUCH A LOVELY DEAR
  
  HE COULD PREACH THE BIBLE LIKE A PREACHER
  FULL OF ECSTASY AND FIRE
  BUT HE ALSO WAS THE KIND OF TEACHER
  FEMALE WOULD DESIRE
  
  RA RA RASPUTIN LOVER OF THE RUSSIAN QUEEN
  THEY PUT SOME POISON INTO HIS WINE
  RA RA RASPUTIN RUSSIA'S GREATEST LOVE MACHINE
  HE DRANK IT ALL AND SET UP IN FIRE
  
  RA RA RASPUTIN LOVER OF THE RUSSIAN QUEEN
  THEY DIDN'T QUIT, THEY WANTED HIS HEAD
  RA RA RASPUTIN RUSSIA'S GREATEST LOVE MACHINE
  AND SO THEY SHOT HIM TILL HE WAS DEAD
  
  OH! THOSE RUSSIANS!
