        <intro> (8 maten)

I.      Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
        Tammy Rogers on victrola up high
        Mama's dancing, there's a baby on her shoulder.
        The sun is setting, light malaise's in the sky.

Bridge: If I could sing, knew how to move everything
        Always wanting more...he'll leave you longing for...

Refr.:  Black velvet in that little boys smile.
        Black velvet with that slow southern style.
        A new religion that will bring ya to your knees.
        <break>
        Black velvet if you please


II.     Up in Memphis the music is like a heatwave.
        Waah lightning! bound to dry you out.
        Mama's baby is in the heart of every schoolgirl.
        "Love me tender" leaves them crying in the awe.

Bridge: They know it was a song, so sweet and true.
        Always wanting more...he'll leave you longing for..

Refr.:  Black velvet in that little boys smile.
        Black velvet with that slow southern style.
        A new religion that will bring ya to your knees.
        <break>
        Black velvet if you please

        <solo> (2 maten)

III.    Every word of every song that he sings for you.
        In a flash he was gone, it happened so soon; what could you do?

        <solo> (8 maten)

Refr.:  Black velvet in that little boys smile.
        Black velvet with that slow southern style.
        A new religion that will bring ya to your knees.
        <break>
        Black velvet if you please

HH:     Black velvet in that little boys smile.
        Black velvet with that slow southern style.
        A new religion that will bring ya to your knees.
        <break>
        Black velvet if you please
        if you please...
        if you please...
