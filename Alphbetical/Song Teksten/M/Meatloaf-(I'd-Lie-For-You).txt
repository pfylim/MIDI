I`d never tell you one lie. I`d never let you down
I`d never leave, I`d be the one who`d always be around
Baby give me a chance
I`d pull the sun out from the sky to light your darkest night
I wouldn`t let one drop of rain fall down into your life
Put your heart in my hands
Baby believe me I could never do you wrong
And I would never be no or booh
Unless sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind
I might be crazy but I`m crazy about you

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Do anything you ask me to
I`d even sell my soul for you
I`d do it all for you
If you just believe in me

Just take a look in my eyes
You`ll see a love that`s blind
Just take a hold of my hand
I`ll take you to paradise
Ain`t a star that`s to fall
Your every wish will be a wish that I will make come true
And if you want the moon I swear I`ll bring it down for you
Let me into your heart
Believe me baby that you now have done my soul
`Cause you`re the only one that I`ll give it to
You`ll even say that I`m a fool to act this way
`Cause if I`m crazy I`m just crazy for you

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Do anything you ask me to
I`d even sell my soul for you
I`d do it all for you
If you just believe in me

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Move mountains if you want me to
I`d walk across the fire for you
I`ll walk along the wire for you
If you just believe in me

And you will never see a day I`ll ever break your heart
You`ll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far
I`ll show you every and every second that you`re in my arm
Baby I`m crazy but I`m crazy about you

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Move mountains if you want me to
I`d walk across the fire for you
I`ll walk along the wire for you
If you just believe in me

I`ll walk along the wire for you
Move mountains if you want me to
I`d walk across the fire for you
Do anything you ask me to

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Do anything you ask me to
I`d even sell my soul for you
I`d do it all for you
If you just believe in me

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
Move mountains if you want me to
I`d walk across the fire for you
I`ll walk along the wire for you
If you just believe in me

I`d lie for you and that`s the truth
