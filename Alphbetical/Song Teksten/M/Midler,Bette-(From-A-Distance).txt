FROM A DISTANCE

Text + Musik: Julie Gold

From a distance
The world looks blue and green
And the snowcapped mountains so white
From a distance the ocean
Meets the streams
And the eagle takes to flight
From a distance
There is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope
It's the voice of peace
It's the voice of everyone
--------------------------------------------------------
From a distance
We all have enough
And no one is in need
There are no guns, no bombs
And no disease
No hungry mouth to feed
For a moment we must
Be instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope
Playing songs of peace
They're the songs of everyone
God is watching us
God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
--------------------------------------------------------
From a distance
You look like my friend
Even through we are at war
From a distance
I can't comprehend what
All this war is for
What we need ist love and harmony
Let it echo throught the land
It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the heart of everyone
It's the hope of hopes
It's the love of loves
It's the song of everyone
--------------------------------------------------------
Sing out songs of hope
Sing out songs of freedom
Sing out songs of love
Sing out songs of peace
Sing out songs of justice
Sing out songs of harmony
Sing out songs of love
Sing out everyone
Sing outt
