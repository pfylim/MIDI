  1. COPACABANA - BARRY MANILOW
  
  Her name was Lola
  She was a showgirl
  With yellow feathers in her hair
  And a dress cut down to there
  She would meringue
  And do the cha - cha
  And while she tried to be a star
  Tony always tended bar
  Across the crowded floor
  They worked from eight till four
  They were young and they had each other
  Who could ask for more?
  
  At the Copa (Copa) Copacabana (Copacabana)
  The hottest spot north of Havana 
  (Here) at the Copa (Copa) Copacabana 
  Music and passion were always the fashion
  At the Copa
  They fell in love.
  (Copa Copacabana)
  
  His name was Rico
  He wore a diamond
  He was escorted to his chair
  He saw Lola dancing there
  And when she finished 
  He called her over (whistle)
  But Rico went a bit too far
  Tony sailed across the bar
  And then the punches flew 
  And chairs were smashed in two
  There was blood and a single gunshot
  But just who shot who?
  
  At the Copa (Copa) Copacabana (Copacabana)
  The hottest spot north of Havana  
  (Here) at the Copa (Copa) Copacabana 
  Music and passion were always the fashion
  At the Copa
  She lost her love.
  
  Copa Copacabana
  Copa Copacabana
  Copacabana
  Music and passion always in fashion.
  
  Her name is Lola
  She was a showgirl
  But that was thirty years ago
  When they used to have a show
  Now it's a disco 
  But not for Lola
  Still in the dress she used to wear
  Faded feathers in her hair
  She sits there so refined 
  And drinks herself half blind
  She lost her youth and
  She lost her Tony
  Now she's lost her mind.

  The hottest spot north of Havana
