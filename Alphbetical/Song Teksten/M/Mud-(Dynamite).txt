Singer : MUD 
Title  : DYNA-MITE

Nobody knew her name
But she turned up just the same
There was a knock on the door
A thump on the floor
And the party turned insane
As she called out her name

Refrain:
And she walked in looking like dynamite
She said now come along, boogaloo
Throughout the night
And by the way she's moving well, dynamite
Might she not with all she's got
She's got the whole town lighting up dynamite
Nobody quite knowing what to do
Wrong of right, but they all know
Dynamite is Dynamite and they're right

She hadn't been there long
When she told us where she came from
There was a flash in the sky
A light in her eye
And the music went on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on

Refrain: ...
