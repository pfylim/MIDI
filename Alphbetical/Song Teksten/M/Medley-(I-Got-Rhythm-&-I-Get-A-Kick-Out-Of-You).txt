
12. MEDLEY - I GOT RHYTHM/I GET A KICK OUT YOU

I GOT RHYTHM

I GOT RHYTHM, I GOT MUSIC,
I GOT MY MAN WHO COULD
ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE? MORE?
I GOT DAISIES IN GREEN PASTURES,
I GOT MY MAN WHO COULD
ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE? MORE?
I GOT STARLIGHT I GOT SWEET DREAMS,
I GOT MY MAN WHO COULD
ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE? MORE?
OLD MAN TROUBLE, I DON'T MIND HIM,
YOU WON'T FIND HIM
'ROUND MY DOOR MORE, WHO COULD
ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE?

I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU

I GET NO KICK FROM CHAMPAGNE,
MERE ALCOHOL DOESN'T THRILL ME AT ALL,
SO TELL ME WHY SHOULD IT BE TRUE,
THAT I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU?
SOME GET A KICK FROM COCAINE
I'M SURE THAT IF I HAD
EVEN ONE SNIFF IT WOULD BORE ME TERRIFIC'LY TOO.
YET I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU.
I GET A KICK EV'RY TIME I SEE YOU'RE STANDING THERE BEFORE ME.
I GET A KICK THO' IT'S CLEAR TO ME YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T ADORE ME.
I GET NO KICK IN A PLANE,
FLYING TOO HIGH WITH SOME GAL IN THE SKY IS MY IDEA OF NOTHING TO DO.
YET I GET A KICK OUT OF YOU.
