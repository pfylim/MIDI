6. LAND OF DREAMING - MASTERBOY

Chorus:
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams. 
Everybody in the land of dreaming
Everybody in the land of dreams. 
Ooh, living in the land of dreaming
Ooh, living in the land of dreaming.

Baby, baby can`t you see
Only in your fantasy.
You are really feeling free
Dreaming is the key.

Take me away, take me away
Take me with you to the stars.
Take me away, take me away
Take me with you to the stars.

As I lay down to close my eyes
Fantasy and inspiration flies.
I lose control as it seems
And I start living in the land of dreams.

Chorus:

Baby, baby you and me
Start me up, set me free.
What you need is to be 
Wonderland for me.

Take me away, take me away
Take me with you to the stars.
Take me away, take me away
Take me with you to the stars.

Chorus:

As I lay down to close my eyes
Fantasy and inspiration flies.
I try to relax and to free my mind
So I can leave everything behind.
Pictures circle round my head.
Some are good, some are bad.
I lose control as it seems
And I start to live in the land of dreams.

Chorus (2x)
