Title  : CRYING

(Words & music: Roy Orbison/Joe Melson)

I was alright for a while
I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stoppend to say hello
And though you wished me well
You couldn't tell that I'd been crying over you
Crying over you

When you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying

It's so hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more than I did before
But darling, what can I do
For you don't love me
And I'll always be crying over you
Crying over you

Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying
Crying, crying, crying

I'm crying, crying over you
