Title  : IN OLD MEXICO

I do not know her name
I thought she was the same
As the girl I've left in old Mexico
Tequila sun and fun and nothing to be done
But I lost my heart in Mexico

I left her there behind
She's always in my mind
That little girl I've met in Mexico
I miss her everyday
So I know I must obey
And go back to her in old Mexico

I hear the guitars playin' every night
I feel sad 'cause she's out of sight
I take the morning flight
And wait no more

When I left her behind
There was nothing on my mind
About love I've never thought before
We both enjoyed the sun
The time there smoothly ran
But I lost my heart in old Mexico

I've met her on a shore
She's the one I adore
Everyday when I was down in Mexico
I miss her everyday
So I know I must obey
And go back to her in old Mexico
