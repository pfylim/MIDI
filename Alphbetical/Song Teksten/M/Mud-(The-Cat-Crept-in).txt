Title  : THE CAT CREPT IN

Hey you guys look who's waitin' outside, ooh
She got style, you can see it in her feline eyes
When she starts movin' you sure can tell
When she starts shakin' she's raisin' hell
I said, hey you guys look who's waitin' outside
Well do you remember how she left that floor
last Saturday night
When the Cat broke loose she darn near started a fight
Well she may be flashin' like neon sign
But you can't touch her 'cos she's mine all mine
I said hey you guys look who's waitin' outside
Let her in

Refrain:
And the cat crept in, crept in, and crept out again
The cat crept in, crept in, and crept out
So I open the door, uh huh huh, for that
High heeled paw, oh yeah
I said the cat crept in, ooh and crept out again
I said the cat crept in and we crept out again

I said hey you guys, can you hear that alley cat cry
Well she ain't superstitious but she's hangin'
on life number nine
Well you may not know it, but she hides in the light
And she may not show it, but this cat can bite
Hey guys, look who's waitin' outside, let her in

I said hey you guys look who's waitin' outside, ooh

Well she may be flashin' like neon sign
But you can't touch her 'cos she's mine all mine
I said hey you guys look who's waitin' outside
