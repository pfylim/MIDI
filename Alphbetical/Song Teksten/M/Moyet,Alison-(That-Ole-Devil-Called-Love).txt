ALISON MOYET - THAT OLE DEVIL CALLED LOVE

It's that ole devil called love again
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Puttin' rain in my eyes, tears in my drink
And rocks in my heart

It's that sly old son of a gun again
He keeps tellin' me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain, still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

S'pose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
The devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around build me up tear me down
I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give me up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song
I've just got to tag along
With that ole devil called love

He'd follow me around build me up tear me down
I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give me up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song
I've just got to tag along
With that ole devil called love
That ole devil called love
