Title  : DRINK LISA DRINK

Drink drink Lisa drink
Drink a bottle of wine
Drink drink Lisa drink
To your bloody health and to mine

Listen to my story
The story of dear Lisa
She's the queen of the drunken sailors
But she never never gets drunk
She's the queen of the drunken sailors
But she never never gets drunk

The story of dear Lisa
The queen of the drunken twaddle
It's a treat to watch her singin'
On the table near the front door
She's a friend indeed, 'cause she helps you
But she was the know how to floor

She's a good companion
But everything is endin'
She died this night after drinkin' in
her bed a bottle of milk
And she shocked on the drink
so you hear what I think
Never leave the bottle of wine
