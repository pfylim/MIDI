  8. NOW AND FOREVER (RICHARD MARX)
  
  
  WHENEVER I'M WEARY FROM THE BATTLES THAT RAGE IN MY HEAD
  YOU MAKE SENSE OF MADNESS WHEN MY SANITY HANGS BY A THREAD
  I LOSE MY WAY BUT STILL YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
  NOW AND FOREVER. I WILL BE YOUR MAN
  
  SOMETIMES I JUST HOLD YOU
  TOO CAUGHT UP IN ME TO SEE
  I'M HOLDING A FORTUNE THAT HEAVEN HAS GIVEN TO ME
  I'LL TRY TO SHOW YOU EACH AND EVERY WAY I CAN
  NOW AND FOREVER. I WILL BE YOUR MAN
  
  NOW I CAN REST MY WORRIES AND ALWAYS BE SURE
  THAT I WON'T BE ALONE ANYMORE
  IF I'D ONLY KNOW YOU WERE THERE ALL THE TIME
  ALL THIS TIME
  
  UNTIL THE DAY THE OCEAN DOESN'T TOUCH THE SAND
  NOW AND FOREVER. I WILL BE YOUR MAN
  NOW AND FOREVER. I WILL BE YOUR MAN
