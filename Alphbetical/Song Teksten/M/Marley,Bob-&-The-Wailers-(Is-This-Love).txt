Title  : IS THIS LOVE

(Words & music: Bob Marley)

I wanna love ya and treat you right
I wanna love ya every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our head
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
And Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love, is this love
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
I've got to know, got to know, got to know
I'm willing and able so I throw my cards on your table

I wanna love ya and treat you right
I wanna love ya every day and every night
We'll be together
With a roof right over our head
We'll share the shelter of my single bed
We'll share the same room
And Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'
Is this love, is this love
Is this love, is this love that I'm feelin'

I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
I've got to know, got to know, got to know
I'm willing and able so I throw my cards on your table
