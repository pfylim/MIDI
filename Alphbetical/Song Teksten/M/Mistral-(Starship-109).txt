(Words & music: Robbie van Leeuwen)

I had a lovely dream last night
About an interplanetary flight
We'd booked on Starship 109
For an ion drive cruise in May
Taking us a million miles away
All prime class on Starship 109
Our first stop was at Tiara Star
A place in the galaxy so far
We heard a voice just overhead say

Ladies and gentlemen 
This is your stewardess speaking
Please return to your cabins in
Approximately eleven minutes
We will come to a rest at the main
Space borne depot
Thank you

We saw a landscape of unreal delight
For sure it was out of sight
Our trip with Starship 109
