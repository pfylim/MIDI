Title  : Live To Tell
Singer : Madonna


I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard
To hide it well
I was not ready for the fall
Too blind to see the writing on the wall

Chorus:
A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell
The secret I have learned
'Til then
It will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once
I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me

Chorus

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again

If I ran away, I'd never have the strength
To go very far
How would they hear
The beating of my heart
Will it grow cold
The secret that I hide, will I grow old
How will they hear
When will they learn
How will they know

Chorus

The truth is never far behind
You kept it hidden well
If I live to tell
The secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again
