Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan, Skokiaan

Ho ho far away in Africa
happy, happy Africa.
They bang a bongo and they sing o.
They have a ball and really go
Skokiaan ho ho.
Take a trip to Africa,
any ship to Africa.
Come on along and learn the lingo.
Beside a jungle bungalow
the hot drums are drumin'.
The hot strings are strummin'
and warm lips are blissful.
they're kiss full of Skokiaan ho ho.
If you go to Africa
happy happy Africa
you'll linger longer like a Kingo.
Right in the jungleungleo.

Skoki, Skoki, Skoki, Skokiaan okey dokey anybody can
Skoki, Skoki man, oh ! man oh ! man you bang a bongo and
you singo in hokey pokey Skokiaan.
