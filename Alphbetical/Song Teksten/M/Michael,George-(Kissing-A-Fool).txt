GEORGE MICHAEL - KISSING A FOOL

You are far, when I could have been your star
You listen to people, who scared you to death, and from my heart
Strange that you are strong enough, to even make a start
But you'll never find, a piece of mind, till you listen to your heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will, for they will
If you let them steal your heart from you
People, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all
We should have seen the truth

Fooled me with the tears in your eyes
Covered me with kisses and lies
So bye, but please don't, take my heart

You are far, I'll never gonna be your star
I'll pickup the pieces and mend my heart
Maybe I'll be strong enough, I don't know where to start
But I'll never find a piece of mind while I listen to my heart

People, you can never change the way they feel
Better let them do just what they will, for they will
If you let them steal your heart,
And people, will always make a lover feel a fool
But you knew I loved you
We could have shown them all

But remember this, every other kiss, that you'll ever give
Oh yes we were real, when you needed him, off another end
When you really can't surrender and
I will wait for you, like I'll always do
But something there, that can't compare, with any other

You are far, when I could have been your star
You listen to people, who scared you to death and from my heart
Strange that I was wrong enough, to think you love me too
Guess you were kissing a fool
You must have been kissing a fool
