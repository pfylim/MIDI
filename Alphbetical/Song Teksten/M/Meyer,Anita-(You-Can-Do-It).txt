Singer : ANITA MEYER 
Title  : YOU CAN DO IT

When you ask me to sing you a song
It doesn't matter what it's all about
I think that I'll get along
As long as you're around
I don't have to have something to say
It's more than enough when you
Give me your music
Play it and I'll fly away
As long as you're around

Know that you, you can
You can do it
Because you showed me oh so
Many times before oh yeah, you
You can, you can do it
Because you know your song
It's telling me so much more

So won't you tell me now
What wait you want me to do
Don't waste too long finding the sound
You know I'll do it for you
As long as you're around
