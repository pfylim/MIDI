Title  : BUZZ BUZZ A-DIDDLE-IT

(Words & music: Frank C. Slay jr/Bob Crewe)

Well, I was rollin' down the highway
To see my baby Ruth
Car broke down, tire blew out
Found a telephone booth
I tried to call my honey
What was the sound I had to hear
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it) in my ear?
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Is some endless yackin' hound docg
Hawking 'n sweet takin' to my dear?
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it, buzz buzz a-diddle-it)

Central seven, who's on that line?
Break through my baby
Three-oh-ninety-nine, oh, S.O.S. me mama
Switch me to heaven, get me through
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Telephone operator, my lovin' future hangs on you
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
(Buzz buzz a-diddle-it)
Come on honey
Get me baby
Come on sugar
Get me honey
