When you woke up this morning
on your front lawn
you had a smile on your lips and
your wallet was gone
you remember some girl
but the rest is all a blur

Well, you're not the first one to fall under
her spell
I know dozens of guys who've been there as well
they've got scars to show
and they own'em all to her

That was Lulu
did she fool you ?
that was Lulu
that ain't legal
that ain't voodoo
that was Lulu

Well, Lulu's got charms that money can't buy
and she's made her reputation
making strong man cry
all the victims may change
but their stories are the same

Lulu's there when your airplane
just happens to crash
still she walks away without even a scratch
leaving in flames
but she never leaves her name

That was Lulu
did she fool you ?
that was Lulu
that ain't legal
that ain't voodoo
that was Lulu

And I know what I'm talking about
I saw it all from the start
long before she started running around
who do you think ran away with my heart
that was Lulu

That was Lulu
did she fool you ?
that was Lulu
that ain't legal
that ain't voodoo
that was Lulu
that was Lulu
that was Lulu
