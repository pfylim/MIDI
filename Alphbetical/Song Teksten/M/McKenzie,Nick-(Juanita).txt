Title  : JUANITA

Sad song in the land of the Spanish sun
Cubalibre sangria and sun prepare the love song
I could do anything I felt free so I followed my heart
But I've told you who's waiting at home
We knew the end from the start
Juanita I kissed the tears from your Spanish eyes
I hate to say goodbye but I've got to leave you
Juanita there's someone who's waiting at home
I can't leave her alone, Juanita

Bitter tears in the eyes of a Spanish girl
A parting cup a parting kiss a parting world
Goodbye to another world
We spend a nice time no regrets
Now it comes to an end for I told you
Who's waiting at home Juanita don't moan
Juanita I kissed the tears from your Spanish eyes
I hate to say goodbye but I've got to leave you
Juanita there's someone who's waiting at home
I can't leave her alone, Juanita

Juanita I kissed the tears from your Spanish eyes
I hate to say goodbye but I've got to leave you
Juanita there's someone who's waiting at home
I can't leave her alone, Juanita
