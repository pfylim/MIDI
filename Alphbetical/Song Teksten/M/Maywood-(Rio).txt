Title  : RIO
Artist : MAYWOOD

(Words & music: Alice May)

Chorus:
Rio, Rio
Land of sun, samba and wine
Rio, Rio
I feel fine

Saying goodbye to friends
Saying goodbye to loneliness
I am on my way to Rio
The place where I wanna be
You know that I soon will leave
So don't try to make me stay
I'm on my way to Rio
I'm coming back some day

Don't you ask me why
Got to live a little longer
Don't you start to cry
Got to be a little stronger

Chorus: ...

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in happiness?
Come with me to Rio
The place where I wanna be
Dancing the night away
No time for tears and sorrow
I'm going back there tomorrow
I'm coming back someday

Don't you ask me why
Got to live a little longer
Don't you start to cry
Got to be a little stronger

Chorus: ...
