Good evening Max Hey how are ya Specs?
Well I'm fine and you, ya mean old crook?
Sit down my mand and have a beer
But keep your heans off the broad who serves it here

Hey listen Max, I'm kinda short?
Well, I'll help ya brother, dontcha worry no more
Ya see, I got this job that's comin' up
Completely save, a real easy job
But first let me tell you what ya must not do
Don't come stoned and don't tell Trude

But Trude doesn't talk, you know she don't
All women talk, let me tell you that
Sooner or later she'll turn ya in
So shut up your big mouth and don't say a thing
Cool it Max there's no need to throb
Relax a bit and tell me about the job
Well, Fat Bob is the lookout, Bert's at the wheel
And it's good clean money we're gonna steal
Meet me at midnight and bring y'r tools
But don't come stoned and don't tell Trude

Hey whatever happened to that long tall cat
A real mean mother with a scar on his head
Yea mean Scarface Lenny, the safe specialist
He boozed away his talents, you c'n scrap 'm from y'r list
So who cracks the safe then, and how do we get in
Fast Alec is our safeman, you know him, he's the King
That sounds o.k. let's have another beer
I'm, in it baby, there ya go Max, cheers
Here's to the job, knew you would
But don't come stoned and don't tell Trude

Hello?
Trude? This is Specs, Listen honey
I got a fantastic job comin' up
A real big one
Oh, far out, when 'nd where?
Come to Kelsy's we'll have a few beers and
I'll tell you all about it
Right on, honey, I'm on my way
