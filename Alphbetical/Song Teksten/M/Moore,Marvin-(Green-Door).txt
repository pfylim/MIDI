Refrain:
   Midnight one more night without sleepin'
   watchin' till the morning comes creepin'
   green door
   what's the secret you're keepin'
   there's an old piano and they play it hot
   behind the green door wish they'd let me in
   so i could find out what's
   behind the green door
----------------------------------------------
Knocked once tried to tell ‚m i'd been there
door slammed hospitality's thin there
wonder just what's goin' on in there
saw an eyeball peepin'
through a smokey cloud
----------------------------------------------
Behind the green door
when i said joe sent me
someone laughed out loud behind the green door
all i want to do is
join the happy crowed
behind the green door
-----------------------------------------------
Refrain:
   Midnight one more night without sleepin'
   watchin' till the morning comes creepin'
   green door
   what's the secret you're keepin'
   there's an old piano and they play it hot
   behind the green door wish they'd let me in
   so i could find out what's
   behind the green door
