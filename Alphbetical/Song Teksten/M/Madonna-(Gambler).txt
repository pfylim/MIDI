MADONNA - GAMBLER

Gambler, gambler

Refrain:

I'm a gambler and I will take you by surprise
Gambler I'll even spit between your eyes
Gambler yeah I know all the words to say
'Cause I'm a gambler I only play the game my way

Don't wanna say this but I think that I should
I'm better off forgotten
If you think that I'll be good
One day you'll see me the next day I'm gone
Don't fight me baby I don't wanna hold on

I'm a gambler, a gambler

You're not happy with the way I act
You better turn around boy don't look back
You're gettin' angry you know I can see
You're just jealous 'cause you can't be me

Refrain: ...

You can't stop me now
'Cause I'm right and I'm makin' advances
Let me show how
Tonight I'll be takin' my chances on you
On you on you on you
That's right baby I'm a gambler
Gambler
Do you understand what I'm talkin' about

Refrain: ...

You can't stop me now
'Cause I'm right and I'm makin' advances
Let me show you how
Tonight I'll be takin' my chances on you
On you on you on you

That's right baby I'm a gambler
Gambler, gambler
'Cause I'm a gambler

You can't stop me now on no oh
