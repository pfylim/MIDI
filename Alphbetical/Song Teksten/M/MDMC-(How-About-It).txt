M D M C - HOW ABOUT IT

I make dreams, we make dreams
Every hour of the day
Break it up, get it down
Scream and turn your body 'round

Hey girls, take your time
Do what girls have to do
Swimming in the ocean
Swimming in bed
Girls are nasty
Their body's wet
Turn my music loud and clear
And scream the words I want to hear

On vacation on tv
We see how ladies want to be

Take time, be around, so scream and shout

Hey girls, hey girls, let's see what we could be
Footsteps in the white gold snow
So make a run now go go go
I'm awake, we're awake
Painting pictures on ev'ry face
So go go go in every land
Go go go on every friend

Take time, be around, so scream and shout

(spoken)
Hey isn't that Marvin?
He's so cute in his pajamas!

Hi, girls
Marvin, I had a wonderful dream last night
How about it?

I make dreams
How about it?
We make dreams
How about it?
