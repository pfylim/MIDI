Title  : One Love / People Get Ready
Singer : Bob Marley & The Wailers


Chorus:
One Love One Heart
Let's get together and feel alright

Hear the children crying (2x)
Saying, give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Saying, let's get together and feel alright
Let them all pass their dirty remarks
There is one question I'd really love to ask
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own, believe me

Chorus

As it was in the beginning
So shall it be in the end
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Let's get together to fight this holy Armageddon

So when the man comes
There will be no-no doom
Have pity on those
Whose chances grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place
From the father of creation, saying

Chorus

I'm pleading to mankind
One Love One Heart
Give thanks and praise to the Lord
And I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
Give thanks and praise and feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
