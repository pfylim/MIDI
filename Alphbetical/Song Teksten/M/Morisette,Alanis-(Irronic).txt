Ironic
From Jagged Little Pill

     An old man turned ninety-eight
     He won the lottery and died the next day
     It's a black fly in your chardonnay
     It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
     Isn't it ironic... don't you think

     Chorus:
     It's like rain on your wedding day
     It's a free ride when you've already paid
     It's the good advice that you just didn't take
     Who would've thought... it figures

     Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
     He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
     He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
     And as the plane crashed down he thought
     "Well, isn't this nice." And Isn't this ironic ... don't you think?

     Repeat Chorus

     Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
     When you think everything's ok and everythings going right
     And life has a funny way of helping you out when
     You think evertyhing's gone wrong and everthing blows up
     In your face

     A traffic jam when you're already late
     A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
     It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife
     It's meeting the man of my dreams
     and then meeting his beautiful wife
     And isn't it ironic... don't you think
     A little too ironic.. and yeah I really do think...

     Repeat Chorus

     Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
     And life has a funny funny way of helping you out
     helping you out
