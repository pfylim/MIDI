Title  : FOOLS TOGETHER

(Words & music: R. de Bois/P. Bewley)

In '72 I started loving you
You made my world go round
We were together
Climb every mountain
No problems around
Day and night we were together

Chorus:
Times have changed
Sunshine into rain
Years went by
Love turned into pain

So, goodbye
I'm leaving you
You were the only one
I gave my love
I gave my pride
Now you're the lonely one
Oh, I have to go

We've made a mess of it
We can't go on like this
Maybe we're fools together
I hope you'll understand
That there's no other end
Hope I made myself clear

We can't continue keep on playing like fools
It ain't no use staying together
I've made up my mind
Gonna leave you behind
'Cause it ain't right staying together

Chorus: ...
