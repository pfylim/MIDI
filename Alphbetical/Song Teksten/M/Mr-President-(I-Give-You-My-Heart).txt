3. I GIVE YOU MY HEART - MR. PRESIDENT

I give you my hope
I`ll give you my dreams.
I`m giving you anything you need.
I`ll give you my joy.
I`ll give you my pain.
I wish we could fall in love again.
I give you my heart.
I give you my heart.
My heart hear it calling
Sexy voice silky sounding.
I would give all I own
To spend some time with you alone.
For your love I can`t give up.
Let it flow. If we drop.
Let me take it from the start
`Cause I give you my heart
Dumm dumm dubidu dumm dumm
Dubidu dai. Oh ho
Dumm dumm dubidu dumm dumm
Dubidu dai. 
I`ll give you my hope
I`ll give you my dreams.
I`m giving you anything you need.
I`ll give you my joy.
I`ll give you my pain.
I wish we could fall in love again.
I give you my heart.
Give me your love.
I give you my heart.
Give me give me your love
I give you my heart.
Give me your love.
I give you my heart.
Give me give me your love
I give you my heart.
Lost three, here they cheat.
But it could be so mighty steep.
Please girl give me your playin`.
For your love I need no gain.
All this time that we`ve been waitin`
Love and passion kept us dating.
Let me take it from the start
`Cause I give you my heart
Dumm dumm dubidu dumm dumm
Dubidu dai. Oh ho
Dumm dumm dubidu dumm dumm
Dubidu dai. 
Refrain
Dumm dumm dubidu dumm dumm
Dubidu dai. Oh ho
I`ll give you my love.
I`ll give you my hope.
I`ll give you anything you want from me.
Baby, baby
I`ll give you my hope
I`ll give you my dreams.
I`m giving you anything you need.
I`ll give you my joy.
I`ll give you my pain.
I wish we could fall in love again.
I give you my heart.
I give you my heart.
I give you my heart.
