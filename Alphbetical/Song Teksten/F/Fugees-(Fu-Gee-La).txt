12. FU-GEE-LA - FUGEES

We used to be number 10
Now we're permanent one,
In the battle lost my finger, 
Mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, 
Blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy 
Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned.
Beat you so bad make you feel 
Like you ain't wanna be born
And tell your friends 
Stay the hell out of my lawn.
Chicken George became Dead George 
Stealin' chickens from my farm.
Damn, another dead pigeon
If your mafiosos then I'm bringin' 
On Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', 
My body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was 
Tongue-kissing a razor blade.
That sounds sick 
Maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto, 
Jacks an ACURA
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies 
Becoming Enemies of their own families.
What's going on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon, 
Trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion.

Chorus
Oooh La La La, 
It's the way that we rock 
When we're doing our thing
Oooh La La La, 
It's the natural law 
That the refugees bring
Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La La, 
Sweet thing

Yeah in saloons we drink Boone's 
And battle goons till high noon,
Bust rap toons on flat spoons, 
Take no shorts like poon poon's.
See hoochies pop coochies, 
For Gucci's and Lucci
Find me in my Mitsubishi, 
Eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees.
Hey Hey Hey
Try to take the crew 
And we don't play play
Say say say
Like Paul McCartney, not hardly,
Oddly enough
I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff 
But they can't handle us, we bust
Cause we fortified, 
I could never hide, seen "Cooley High", 
Cried when Cochise died.
I'm twisted, black-listed 
By some other negroes,
Don't remove my Polos 
On the first episode.
Ha Ha Ha Ha, 
You shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, 
You whole sound set's bootie , and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, 
You have to respect Jersey, 
`Cause I'm superfly when
I'm super-high on the Fu-Gee-La.

Chorus

I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees,
Smokin' beadies as I burn my calories,
Brooklyn roof tops 
Become Brooklyn tee-pees,
Who that be, enemies, 
Wanna see the death of me.
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, 
I run marathons, like Buju Banton, 
I'm a true champion, like,
Farakkhan reads his Daily Qu'ran 
It's a phenomenon, 
Lyrics fast like Ramadan.

What's goin' on
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon, 
Trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion.
What's goin' on
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon, 
Trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion.

Chorus 2x
