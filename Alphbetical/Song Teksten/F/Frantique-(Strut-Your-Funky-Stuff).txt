Title  : STRUT YOUR FUNKY STUFF

(Words & music: J. Robinson/V.S. Robinson/J. Bolden)

Get up stand up
Strut your funky stuff, sho nuff
Get up stand up
Strut your funky stuff, sho nuff

How you gonna be the attraction
If you're gonna stick to the wall
Grab yourself a piece of the action
You got to get out or wail
And shake your big tail, get up or go
When you got it to show
Stand up or shoot and dance it
Or out come on

Chorus:
Whatcha doing there in the corner?
Sittin' by yourself in the dark?
You don't really want to be no loner
C'mon now, get up and dance
Y'got ants in your pants
Ya can't sit still: come on and get ya fill
Direct feet to the funky disco beat

Chorus: ...

You don't have to dance like Travolta
You just have to rise up and shine
Move it like a slow roller coaster
C'mon now, get with the groove: get up and move
Get off you butt, get outta the rut
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, dance

Chorus: ...
