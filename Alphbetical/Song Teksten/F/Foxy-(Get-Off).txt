Title  : GET OFF

(Words & music: C. Driggs/L. Ledesma)

These here ladies are at our discretion
So we can get off
Peeking under the sheets with two lovelies
So we can get off
The love that we get from ladies
And make me get off
Take it from girls with our imagination
So we can get off

Chorus:
I'll be out to your place
I can love you crazy
In the heat you will understand
Danger and excitement
I'll soon make your lady
Find out what she wants in a man
To get off, to get off, to get off

Put on that dress that drives me crazy
And we can get off
Sexuality excites my mind
And makes me get off
If I were you, I'd get a good perspective
On how to get off
Love me wild and love me crazy
And make me get off

Chorus: ...
