FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS - GOOD THING

The one good thing in my life
Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I can't follow her
The one good thing (hey, hey, hey) didn't stay too long
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh)
My back was turned (hey, hey, hey) and she was gone

Good thing where have you gone (doob-doobie-doo)
Now good thing you've been gone too long
(Good thing doo-doo-doobie-doo)

People say I should forget
There's plenty more don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometimes
That's not what I (hey, hey, hey) want to hear
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh)
I want to hear (hey, hey, hey) she wants me near

Good thing where have you gone (doob-doobie-doo)
Now good thing you've been gone too long
(Good thing doo-doo-doobie-doo good thing)

Then one day she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came (hey, hey, hey) into my room
(Woo-hoo-hoo-ooh)
Caught me dreaming (hey, hey, hey) like a fool

Good thing ah ah ah my good thing (doob-doobie-doo)
My my my my good thing where have you gone
(Doob-doob-doobie-doo)
My good thing ooh-hee my good thing (doob-doobie-doo)
(Good thing) yeah where have you gone (doob-doob-doobie-doo)
(Good thing) it's been so long you're gone again
(Doob-doob-doobie-doo)
You're gone again, you're gone again(doob-doob-doobie-doo)
(Good thing) you're gone (doob-doobie-doo) you're gone
(Good thing doob-doob-doobie-doo) you're gone
