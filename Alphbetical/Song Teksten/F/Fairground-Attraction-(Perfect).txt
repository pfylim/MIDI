FAIRGROUND ATTRACTION - PERFECT

(Words & music: Fairground Attraction/Moloney)

I don't want half hearted love affairs
I need someone who really cares
Life is too short to play silly games
I've promised myself I won't do that again

Refrain:
It's got to be-e-e-e-e perfect
It's got to be-e-e-e-e worth it
Too many people take second best
But I won't take anything less
It's got to be-e-e-e-e perfect

Young hearts are foolish they make such mistakes
They're much too eager to give their love away
Well I have been foolish too many times
Now I'm determined to get it right
