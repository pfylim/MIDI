Title  : MAKING YOUR MIND UP
Artist : BUCKS FIZZ

(Words & music: ?)

You gotta speed it up
And then you gotta slow it down
Cos if you believe that a love can hit the top
You gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up

You gotta turn it on
And then you gotta put it out
You gotta be sure that it's something
Everybody's gonna talk about
Before you decide that the time's arrived
For making your mind up

Don't let your indecision
Take you from behind
Trust your inner vision
Don't let others change your mind

Chorus:
And now you really gotta burn it up
And make another flight by night
Get a run for your money
And take a chance
And it'll turn out right
And when you can see how it's gonna be
You're making your mind up

And try to look as if you don't care less
But if you want to see some more
Bending the rules of the game
Will let you find the one you're looking for
Ans then you can show that you think you know
You're making your mind up

Chorus: ....2x...

Now you really gotta speed it up
And then you gotta slow it down
Cos if you believe that a love can hit the top
You gotta play around
But soon you will find that there comes a time
For making your mind up
