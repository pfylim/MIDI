Title  : MY FEET WON'T MOVE
Artist : FRUITCAKE

(Words & music: R.J. Taekema)

Chorus:
My feet won't move
I just don't get that funky stuff
My feet won't move
I just don't get that funky stuff

I live in a house that's build in front of a disco
So I am supposed to be familiar with that kind of music
But all I get is a headache
At night it keeps me awake

Chorus: ...

Sometimes there are times that I caon't hold myself
So I put on my fancy clothes and I enter what
I call a dancing hall
But when I smile to a lady
And ask her for a dance
She rather kicks me on the balls

Chorus: ...

I wish someone would tell me what I got to do
To get involved with the nightlife
You don't know what I'm going through
Sitting in this room of mine night after night
Waiting for a star that is showing me the light

Chorus: ...
