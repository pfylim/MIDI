FLYING PICKETS - ONLY YOU

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
Moving further away
Want you near me

Refrain:
All I needed
Was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of your name
And it's only a game
And I need you
Listening to the words that you say
Getting harder to stay
When I see you

Refrain: ...(2x)...

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

Refrain: ...
