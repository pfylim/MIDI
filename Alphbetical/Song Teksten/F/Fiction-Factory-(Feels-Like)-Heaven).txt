FICTION FACTORY - (FEELS LIKE) HEAVEN

Heaven is closer now today
The sound is in my years
I can't believe the things you say
They echo what I feel
Twisting the bones until they snap
I scream but no one knows
Say I'm familiar cold to touch
And then you turn and go

Refrain:
Feels like heaven
Feels like heaven

See how we plan for saddened eyes
And tears to pave the way
I fought the fever as I knew
My hair it turned to grey
Study you, face and fade the frame

The ghost will comfort now
We can recall the harmony
That lingered but turned sour

Refrain: ...

You want it all
I had to give
See me I feel see me I live
Feels like heaven (heaven is closer,
heaven is closer) (4x)
