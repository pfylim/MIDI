Title  : LAY LOVE ON YOU

(Words & music: John David Parker/Tanja)

Oh, sugar, can't you see the way I feel?
My head is spinning and it's real
The love you have for me
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Don't make it harder than it is
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Be close to you

Chorus:
Lay love on you
I burn when you touch me
Big heart be true
Don't set me free
Sweet things you do
Could scream when you love me
Lay love on you
Lay love on me, me, me

Oh darling, the truth is plain to see
Gotta have your fragrance near to me
To squeeze you tenderly
Oh, oh, oh, angel
Please, stop this hurting deep inside
Just show your fondness, please be kind
So kind to me

Chorus: ...
