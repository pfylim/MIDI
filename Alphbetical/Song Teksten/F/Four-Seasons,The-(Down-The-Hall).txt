Singer : THE FOUR SEASONS 
Title  : DOWN THE HALL

(Words & music: Gaudio/Parker)

She moved in down the hall
So I paid her a call
She flashed a smile
I stayed a while
I've always lived alone
Just quiet nights at home
But Lord knows when
They'll come again

Refrain:
I moved in down the hall
No pride, no pride at all
I don't intend to let it end
Now I know I've been well bed
So I must have been misled
Until I'm found
I'm safe and sound, doot'n

Doot'n doot doot doo shimmering
Endlessly illuminating me
You dance and you spin queen of harlequins
Whirlin' and twirlin' you love to excite
All through the night over and over
You love to excite whirlin' and twirlin'
All through the night over
Over and over you love to excite

Refrain: ...
