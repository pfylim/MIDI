Longer. - Dan Fogelberg. Written by D. Fogelberg (P)1979
----------------------------------------------------------------

  Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean,
Higher than any bird has ever flew, 
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens,
I've been in love with you.

  Stronger than any mountain cathedral,
Truer than any tree ever grew,
Deeper than any forrest primeval,
I am in love with you.

  I'll breath fire in the winters,
You'll send showers in the springs,
We'll fly through the falls and summers,
with love on our way

Through the years as the fire starts to mellow,
Burning lines in the book of our lives,
Do the bindings crumps, and the pages start to yellow,
I'll be in love with you.

<solo>

  Longer than there've been fishes in the ocean,
Higher than any bird has ever flew, 
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens,
I've been in love with you.

I am in love with you...
