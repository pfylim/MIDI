Title  : Through The Years
Singer : Tim Finn


I met a girl who wasn't quite right
She wandered all alone in the night
She understands the past
Present and the future
She takes me back to where I was then
And leads me on again and again
I'm happy now and I owe
Everything to her

Chorus:
And she was calling me
Back through the years
Leading me on through the years
Calling me back through the years

I want to be oblivious
To all the things that worry us
I want to learn the secrets of the universe

Chorus (2x)

I'm never gonna find the answer
And it's never gonna be
Exactly what I hoped it was
But it's good enough for me

I never know just when she'll come
But when she does, to her I'll run
For she is the key to everything
I ever hoped for

Chorus (2x)
