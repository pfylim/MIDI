Title  : STANDING ON THE INSIDE

(Words & music: Neil Sedaka)

Standing on the outside
Looking in
You know it's been a long time
Don't you know where to begin
So much I wanna say
So much I wanna do
Friends are telling me
It's time that you broke thru'

I've been thru the hard times
Of searching souls
You know it's been a hard climb
From rock and roll
Now I feel a need in me
So hard to explain
Now I feel the joy and lithe
And I wanna remain

Standing on the inside
I finally broke that line
Ring around in circles
Don't you know that it feels so fine
Ev'ry waking moment

I just wanna sing the news
That I'm standing on the inside
I kicked away them blues

All the phoney faces
Standing line
All the back slappers
Know my name this time
Now that I turned the lock
Now that i've opened the door
I won't be on the inside anymore
