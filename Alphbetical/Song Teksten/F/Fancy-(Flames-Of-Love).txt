              Flames Of Love         Fancy    
                                                                                       
            
What kind of man, what kind of man am I ?
I try to walk where I just fell, I try to break a secret spell,
In your eyes I fell the flames of love.
                                    
Flames of love, flames of love,
I'm drowning in the sea of love and enough is never enough.
When I find myself deep in your eyes over and over again -
Flames of love.

What kind of fool, what kind of fool am I ?
I look for shadows in the sun, for memories of days to come,
In your eyes I feel the flames of love.

I surrender to sweet death in your arms in a wawe of lustful life.
You touch me so deep, I cry out melting in the flames of love.
