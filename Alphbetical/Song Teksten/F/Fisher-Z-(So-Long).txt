Title  : SO LONG

(Words & music: John Watts)

When I read your letter I couldn't believe that you'd gone
I dialled your number but no one answered the phone
I asked your friends to tell me if they knew where you were
They said they thought that you are ill
I hired a detective to try and find out where you were
He managed to trace you, I know that you are living in France
A watchman saw you climb into someone else's care
And drive off laughing in the night

Chorus:
Why didn't you tell me? not leave me this way
You should have warned me and not waited for so long

I tried to forget you, but I found myself walking the street
I went to the doctor and he gave me something to sleep
I've sent you telegrams, but you haven't answered one
Your mother told me I best leave you well alone
I hope you're satisfied, now you've done this thing to me
I hope you're pleased with what you've done

Chorus: ...

For so long I never realised just exactly who you are
I never realised the girl I had before
I hope you're satisfied, you won't hear from me again
I hope you're pleased with what you've done

Chorus: ...
