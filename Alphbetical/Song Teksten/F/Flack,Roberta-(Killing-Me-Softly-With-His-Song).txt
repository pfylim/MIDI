Interpret:    ROBERTA FLACK

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.

I heard he sang a good song
Iheard he had a style,
and so I came to see him and listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy a stranger to my eyes

Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.

I felt all flushed with fever 
embarrassed by the crowd,
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.

Strumming my pain with his fingers, 
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.

He sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair
and then he looked right through me 
as if I wasn't there.
But he was there this stranger
singing clear and strong.

Strumming my pain with his fingers,
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.

He was strumming there
yea he was singing my life,
killing me softly with his song,
killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words,
killing me softly with his song.
