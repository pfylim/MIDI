PHIL FEARON & GALAXY - EVERYBODY'S LAUGHING

Many years at school I made myself look such a fool
Everybody laughed (everybody laughed)
I said that I would mary her that pretty girl in the
lower year (everybody laughed)
She wondered what all the fuss was about
And because she could not work it out
I wrote a letter on a page and put it in her bag one day
And the letter said

Refrain:
Everybody's laughing because it's you I'm asking
They don't feel my chances are high
They said that I don't have what it takes to
make you love me
All the same I just have to try

Then it came I had my chance to talk to her at
the local dance
Everybody laughed (everybody laughed)
'Cause all the local Romeos were trying to put
on a show
For her eyes (everybody laughed)

She wondered what all the fuss was about
And because she could not work it out
I had to let her know right there and so I
whispered in her ear

Refrain: ...

She said she'd already made up her mind
And to forget about those old fashioned sweet talk lines
But to wait until the laughter all subsides
And tell that awful crowd that she'll be mine

Refrain: ...
