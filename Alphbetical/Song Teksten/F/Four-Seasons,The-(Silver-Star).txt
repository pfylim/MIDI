Singer : THE FOUR SEASONS 
Title  : SILVER STAR

In my dream I'm a western hero
Riding my palomino
Silver Star, there you are
Silver Star

In my dream I make much dinero
Chasing the bandelleros
Silver Star, there you are
Silver Star

You gave me your nine to five honey
Ain't living but I'm alive
Sure cut me down to size
You gave me the second prize
I'm laying it on the line, honey
I'll let it go by this time
Next time around I swear
I'm gonna get me somewhere
Somewhere

In my dream I'm a desert hero
Bigger than Valentino
Silver Star, there you are
Silver Star

Got my gun and my white ten gallon
Bigger than life I reckon
Silver Star, there you are
Silver Star

Leading ladies and warm embraces
Ecstacy on their faces
Silver Star, there you are
Silver Star
