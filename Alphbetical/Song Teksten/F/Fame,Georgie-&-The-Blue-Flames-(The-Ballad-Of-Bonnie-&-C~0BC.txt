
8. THE BALLAD OF BONNIE & CLYDE - GEORGIE FAME & THE BLUE FLAMES

Bonnie & Clyde were pretty looking people.
But I can tell you people they`re the Devils children.
Bonnie & Clyde began their evil doing. 
One lazy afternoon down some run away.

They went and robbed a store.
And high tailed out of that town.
Got clean away in a stolen car.
And waited till the heat died down.

Bonnie & Clyde advanced their reputation.
And made their graduation in the banking business.
Reached for the sky and talking Clyde would holler.
As Bonnie put the dollars in the burlap bag

Now one big man, he tried to take `em all along.
They left him lying in a pool of blood.
And laughed about it all the way home.

Bonnie & Clyde got to be public enemy number one.
Running and hiding from every American wild man`s gun.
They used to laugh about dying.
But deep inside them they knew.
That pretty soon they`d be lying.
Beneath the ground together.
Pushing up daisies toward the sun in the morning dew.

Acting upon reliable information.
The federal deputation layed a deadly ambush.
When Bonnie & Clyde came walking in the sunshine.
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them.

Bonnie & Clyde lived a lot together.
And finally together they died.
