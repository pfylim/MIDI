Could have got through anytime
Could lonely puritan
What are you fighting for
It's not my security

It's just an old war
Not even a cold war
Don't say it in Russian
Don't say it in German
Say it in broken English.
Say it in broken English.

Lost your father, your husband
Your mother, your children
What are you dying for
It's not my reality

It's just an old war,...

What are you fighting for,...

Could have go got through any time,...

It's just an old war,...
