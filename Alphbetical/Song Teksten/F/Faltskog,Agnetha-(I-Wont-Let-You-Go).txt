AGNETHA F„LTSKOG - I WON'T LET YOU GO

Some girls want to play with you
Doing things that they really can't do
They think that love is a game to play
They ought a know that I get my way
They look at you with starry eyes
Very soon they all realize
Play with fire and your fingers burn
I wanna tell them they never learn

I won't let you go no no no
I'll never let go, oh baby, you know
There's a special kind of love
There's something magic when we touch
I won't let you go no no no
All the love I feel inside
I want you with me by my side

I never dreamed I would stay with you
Just one look and I knew you were true
One more day and I woke up to find
I couldn't think you were on my mind
I can't believe those other guys
Hanging round with that look in their eyes
They'll never know what I'll get from you
I wanna tell them I never do
