FOX THE FOX - PRECIOUS LITTLE DIAMOND

Well I got my reasons
Why I still believe in you
You're my cry of wonder
There's no doubt, I need you
Love is talking to me
Whisper sweet things in my ears

Chain to chain reaction
If you pull I move along
You're my will and pleasure
Never felt so good, so strong

Refrain:(2x)
Precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Precious little diamond
Let it come to you - Crystallizing you

I still got my reasons
Won't you talk to me
You're a precious little diamond
Baby stay with me
As you coming closer
Pressure disappears
Babe take it over
Everything so clear

Ah ah ah
Ooh, I got my reasons
Won't you talk to me
You're a precious little diamond
Baby stay with me
As you're getting closer
Pressure disappears
Babe take it over
Everything so clear
