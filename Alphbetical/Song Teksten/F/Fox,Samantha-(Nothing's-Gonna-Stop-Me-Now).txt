     Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now              Samantha Fox                                                             
                        
            
There was a time, I couldn't get out of my mind.
And since the day you came you tried to take control of me.
Then came the day, I thought about running away.
And now my bags are packed, don't even think of holding me back.

Nothing's gonna stop me now and I don't wanna talk it over.
I said nothing's gonna stop me now, gonna break it up,
Gonna take my love away.

Day after day I saw it sleeping away,
You took myself respect and you made a fool of me.
Time after time, I turned it round in my mind,
And now my minds mad up to live the past behind me.
