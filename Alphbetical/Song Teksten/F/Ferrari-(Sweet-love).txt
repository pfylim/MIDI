Title  : SWEET LOVE

I can't forget the love I had
Yes, it's true I am so sad
She's so sweet so tender and so kind
She's my world my everything
And I know that it's a sin
That her face is always on my mind
Now I'm walking through the rain
And I'm only feeling pain
I've lost her and there's nothing I can do
In my eyes she was a queen
Like no one I've ever seen
Now I'm lonely and she's so far away

Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love

I hope she will come back to me
'Cause she still has got the key
The room of love is open all the time
I dreamed of her day after day
It was on the first of may
Then I saw her and once I fell in love

Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love

Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Oh my sweet love
