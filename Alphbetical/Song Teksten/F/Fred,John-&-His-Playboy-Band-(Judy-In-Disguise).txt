  Well, that's all what you are
  A lemonade pass
  With your brand new car.
  
  It's a kind of low bask
  Come tell me tonight
  Judy in disguise
  With glasses.
  
  I keep on wearing your bracelets
  And your new are out
  Across your heart yeah!
  Which you're living round.
  
  I tell this sweet kind of a guy
  Judy in disguise
  With glasses.
  
  Come tell me tonight
  Come tell me tonight
  I've taken everything in sight
  A zipper, the strings for my kite.

  You made me a laughing ashes
  I guess I'll just take your glasses.
