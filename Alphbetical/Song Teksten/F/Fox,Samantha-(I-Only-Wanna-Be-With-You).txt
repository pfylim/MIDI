SAMANTHA FOX - I ONLY WANNA BE WITH YOU

I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never wanna let you go
'Cause you started something, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you

It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I wanna spend each moment of the day with you
Oh look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this
It's crazy but it's true, I only wanna be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

Now listen honey I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
'Cause you started something, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you

You stopped and smiled at me
Asked if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

Now listen honey I just wanna be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together honey I don't care
'Cause you started something, can't you see
That ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
It happens to be true, I only wanna be with you

No matter what you do
I only I only I only wanna be with you
