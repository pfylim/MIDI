Title  : All Together Now
Singer : The Farm


Remember boy that your forefathers died
Lost in millions for our country's pride
But never mention the trenches of Belgium
When they stopped fighting and they were won
A spirit stronger than a war was at work that night
December 1914 cold, clear and bright
Countries borders were right out a sight
When they joined together and decided not to fight

Chorus:
All together now (3x)
in no man's land

It's the same old story again
All those tears shed in vain
Nothing learned or  nothing gained
Only hope remains

Chorus (3x)

The boys had their say
They said no - stop the slaughter
Let's go home, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go home

Chorus
