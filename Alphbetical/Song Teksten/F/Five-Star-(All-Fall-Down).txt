FIVE STAR - ALL FALL DOWN

All fall down all fall down all fall down
I used to wake up at night
Feeling so lonely before I knew
You really loved me
I used to cry in my sleep with
tears on my pillow
I didn't know you wanted to know
But now you've changed my world
I'm wondering how to keep myself
from falling over
You're a special one my baby
And when you touch me

All fall down
It's taking me up to the highest
love I've ever known
All fall down
I'm dizzy when I think of you
If ever a star was the brightest
you know that you can lead me high
Higher higher yeah

Used to be unsure
Afraid I'd discover you want a
friend and not a lover
But there's no fear in my mind
'Cause now we're together
Our love keeps growing bigger
and better
I could jump for joy you sweet thing
See me walk on air when people staring
They're looking at a mystery
And when when you smile at me

All fall down
Happy makes you feel that way
It's taking me up to the highest
love I've ever known
All fall down
I'm dizzy when I think of you
Wherever you go I will follow
'Cause you can lead me home
Higher

You're making me dance make me sing
Anything as long as you are here with me
I've found I can't touch the ground
You know you can make my inhibitions
All fall down

H-H-H-Higher H-H-H-Higher H-H-H-Higher

All fall down
Happy makes you feel that way
It's taking me up to the highest
love I've ever known
All fall down
I'm crazy when I think of you
(Higher) If ever a star was the brightest
You know you can lead me home
All fall down
Happy makes you feel that way
Taking me up to the highest
love I've ever known
I'm dizzy when I think of you
(Baby) wherever you go I will follow (baby)
Because you can lead me home
All fall down
