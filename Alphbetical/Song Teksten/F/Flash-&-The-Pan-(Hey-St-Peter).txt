Singer : FLASH & THE PAN 
Title  : HEY ST. PETER

(Words & music: Vanda/Young)

The morning went cold and lonely
City lights old and grey
The summer rose and tried to smile
And gave it all away

The honkey tonk called the danger
The stranger couldn't pay the bill
Made a stand, raised his hand
Sang a song, no time to kill

Refrain:
I said, (hey) , hey St. Peter
I've got a thing to tell
Just been down in New York town
It really feels like hell (hell)
It really feels like hell

Billy was out of fashion
Manhattan was years ago
Yesterday he wasted time
Money was kind of slow

Billy had friends of glory
Billy was a friend of fame
Took a chance and raised his hand
Sang a song, now he's back in the game

Refrain: ...
I said
Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
It really feels like hell
It really feels like hell

Hey St. Peter
Before you ring your bell
Just been down in New York town
Done my time in hell
Done my time in hell

Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
Hey, (hey), hey St. Peter
It really feels like hell
It really feels like hell
It really feels like hell
