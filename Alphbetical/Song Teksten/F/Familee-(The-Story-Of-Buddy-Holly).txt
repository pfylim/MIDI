Title  : THE STORY OF BUDDY HOLLY

(Words & music: Peter Koelewijn/Buddy Holly)

Nineteen fifty-nine was such a big year
A great loss for rock and roll
Richy Valence and the Big Bobber
And the greatest of them all

Buddy Holly, can't forget you
Buddy Holly, still hear your songs
Buddy Holly, I remember

I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy, my Peggy Sue
Will I love you girl
Yes, I love you Peggy Sue
Will I love you girl
Yes, I love you Peggy Sue

Heartbeat, why do you miss
When my baby's kissing me

Chu, chu, chu, chu
Chu, chu, chu, chu, do

Heartbeat, why does a love kiss
Stay in my memory

Chu, chu, chu, chu
Chu, chu, chu, chu do

Every day it's getting closer
Going faster then a roller coaster
Love like yours will truly come my way
Hey, hey

Buddy Holly, lonely and ever lease
Buddy Holly, they sang your songs
Buddy Holly, even the Beatles

Words of love you
Whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Ohoh, ohoh, ohoh

Twenty years later
We're singing your songs
They never lost power and soul
Though we know
We don't sound that good
You're the best friend of them all

Buddy Holly, Buddy Holly

That will be the day when you say goodbye
That will be the day when you make me cry
You say you gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that will be the day when I die

That will be the day when you say goodbye
That will be the day when you make me cry
You say you gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that will be the day when I die

All my love all my kissing
You don't know what you've been missing
Oh boy, oh boy, when you're with me
Oh boy, oh boy, the world can't see
That you are meant for me

Buddy Holly (10x)
