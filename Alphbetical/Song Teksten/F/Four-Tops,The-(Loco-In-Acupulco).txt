                            LOCO IN ACUPULCO               

     As performed by: The Four Tops              


     Goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..yes, you'll be..
     goin' loco down in Acupulco, the magic down there is so stro-ong..

     Feel the pressure, your back's against the wall
     love is gainin' on you, you're just about to fall
     if you're afraid to love, afraid to take a chance
     you better hide your feelings, get out while you can

    'Cause you'll be goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..
     yes, you'll be..goin' loco down in Acupulco,
     the magic down there is so stro-ong

     You can hear voices bleeding through those warm latin nights...
     memories are lost and found,..leaving broken hearts..all over town

    'Cause you'll be goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..
     yes, you'll be..goin' loco down in Acupulco,
     the magic down there is so stro-ong

     You'll be pullin' out your hair,..drownin' in despair
     with a whole lot of nothing, on your way to nowhere
     your search for Paradise will come to an end..
     when you realise what a fool you've been

     You'll be haunted by her face,..missing her warm embrace.....memories 
     of lovin' her,..holding her tight,..every night...was that the best..
     part of your li-ife?...hearing her voice..soft an' low-ow,..begging you
     to please, please don't go,...don't go no-o!,..don't go!,...don't go!..

     BRIDGE FOLLOWED BY SOLO...................................

     You can hear voices bleeding through those warm..latin nights...
     memories are lost and found,..leaving broken hearts..all over town,
     all over town

    'Cause you'll be goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..
     yes, you'll be..goin' loco down in Acupulco,
     the magic down there is so stro-ong...

     Goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..
     yes, you'll be..goin' loco down in Acupulco, 
     the magic down there is so stro-ong...

     Goin' loco down in Acupulco,..if you stay too lo-ong..
     yes, you'll be..goin' loco down in Acupulco,
     the magic down there is so stro-ong...

     (goin' loco down in Acupulco).....(goin' loco down in Acupulco).....
