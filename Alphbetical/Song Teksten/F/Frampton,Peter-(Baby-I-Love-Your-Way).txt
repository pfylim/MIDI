Title  : BABY, I LOVE YOUR WAY

(Words & music: Peter Frampton)

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way
Wanna tell  you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day

Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pine
But don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait

Ooh baby, I love your way
Wanna tell  you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day

I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and grey and blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one out of season
Don't hesitate, 'cause your love won't wait

Ooh baby, I love your way
Wanna tell  you I love your way
Wanna be with you night and day
