FUN FUN - HIT MIX

Station, happy station
Very special people you can meet at the station
Station, happy station
Glad and smiling faces come from different places
Color my love, with a flower or just a kiss
Color my love, love is a color, the color of my love is you

When I'm lost and down it's you that I miss
Now my love is somewhere lost in your kiss
And my heart is beating (I need you baby)
You can get me high, you can drive me crazy

I need you 'cause you're funny
I love you 'cause you're sweet honey
Put me now in the right new direction
With your love and with your affection

People are looking up to see them carry on
I feel the music, hum, under the setting sun
A never ending desire, will never know your name
And every move you inspire, a word could not explain
The love is there inside, deep in your spanish eyes
And to a serenade, you dance the night away
Baila Bolero, another dance for me
You'll take my heart, hasta luego
Don't be afraid to give your latin love to me
Don't ever set me free

Come take my hand I know you can
Everybody's gonna dance all night
Now that you're mine it's party time
Everybody's gonna dance all night

DJ you are my love

The sound is good
The sound is good

I can see you every night
You're my secret love, you're my only love
You can turn on the lights of my dreams of my world
Honey give me just one chance, my heart is in your hands
You're so fine so mysterious, I need you baby
Let the music play
You give me your love, with a kiss high tension
You can turn me on, oh, sweet temptation
All your love, a kiss high tension
Turn me on, turn me on, give me , give me your love
