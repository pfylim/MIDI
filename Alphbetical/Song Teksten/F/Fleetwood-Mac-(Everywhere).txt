FLEETWOOD MAC - EVERYWHERE

(Words & music: ...)

I'm calling out your name
Calling out your name

Can you hear me calling
Out your name
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say

I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Refrain:
Oh, I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I want to be with you everywhere
(I want to be with you everywhere)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say
I'm acting peculiarly

C'mon baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Refrain: ...

I'm calling out your name
Calling out your name

Come along baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you brake my heart

Refrain: ...(2x)...
