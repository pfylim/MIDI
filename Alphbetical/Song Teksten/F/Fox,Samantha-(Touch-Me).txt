SAMANTHA FOX - TOUCH ME (I want your body)

Ah touch me touch me (this is the night)
Ah touch me touch me I wanna feel your body

Full moon in the city
And the night was young
I was hungry for love
I was hungry for fun
I was hunting you down
And I was the bait
When I saw you there
I didn't need to hesitate

This is the night
This is the night
This is the night
We've got to get it right
(This is the night)

REFRAIN:
Touch me touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
Touch me touch me now

Quick as a flash
You disappeared into the night
Did I hurt you boy
Didn't I treat you right
You made me feel so good
Made me feel myself
Now I'm alone
And you're with somebody else

This is the night yeah
This is the night
This is the time
We've got to get it right
(This is the night

REFRAIN: ...

Hot and cold emotions
Confusing my brain
I could not decide between
Pleasure and pain
Like a tramp in the night
I was begging for you
To treat my body like you wanted to
I was begging for you
(This is the night

Touch me touch me I wanna feel your body
Your heartbeat next to mine (this is the night)
'Cause I want your body all the time (this is the night)

REFRAIN: ...

Ah touch me touch me (this is the night)
Touch me touch me I wanna feel your body
(This is the night) touch me touch me touch me
