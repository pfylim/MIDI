A-HA - TOUCHY

(Words & music: Harket/Mags/Waaktaar)

Hey c'mon c'mon shoot
Donna found us in her slow and dreamy way
I can't hear a word the waiters say
She's looking older now the color of her hair
She walks into the room too pleased to find me there

Refrain:
Me I'm touchy, touchy you
Me I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me I'm touchy, touchy you
Me I'm touchy, and you know what to do

Both of us together in a room by ourselves
I sneeze to look around but there's no escape
What can I do what can I say
She's waiting for this moment to explain itself

Me I'm touchy, touchy you
Me I'm touchy, and you know what to do
Me I'm touchy, touchy touchy you
Touching love, is the best I can do

Oh oh hey (this time you've gone too far)
(You know how touchy we are)
(Hey this time you've gone too far)
C'mon, c'mon don't you know I'm touchy
(Don't you know how touchy we are)

Donna found us in her slow and dreamy way
Now she reads me what the papers say
The way she laughs at what I do
I'm waiting for this moment to explain itself through

Refrain: ...

Oh oh hey (this time you've gone too far)
(You know how touchy we are)

C'mon, c'mon don't you know I'm touchy
