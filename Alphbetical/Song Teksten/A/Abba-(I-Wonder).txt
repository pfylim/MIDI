Singer : ABBA 
Title  : I WONDER

(Words & music: Andersson/Anderson/Ulvaeus)

This park and these houses
Old streets I have walked
Every thing dear
Will it be here
One day when I am returning

My friends will get married
Have children and homes
It sounds so nice
Well planned and wise
Never expecting surprise

Chorus:
I wonder
It's frightening
Leaving now
Is that the right thing
I wonder
It scares me
But who the hell I am
If I don't even try
I'm not a coward
Oh no, I'll be strong
One chance in a lifetime
Yes, I will take it
It can't go wrong

My friends and my family
This dull little town
Busses I've missed
Boys that I've kissed
Everything old and familiar

Chorus: ...
