Ann-Maria sit down, have you made up your mind by now?
No, there's no need to cry, or reproach,
You have tried so hard to take it easy.
Ann-Maria be true, do you think you're th only one
Ain't it better to have lost, than never ever
Have been loved before.

Ann-Maria dance to the music and feel fine
Mexico's got love enough beneath each sombrero
Ann-Maria dance to the music and feel fine
Mexico's got love enough beneath each sombrero.
El amor is closer by than you think in Mexico.

Ann-Maria you're young and you still have so much to learn
All you need is to know that wherever you go
You've got friends to take it easy.
Ann-Maria you'll dance and you'll dance for a nice romance
An ever lasting love, you've been dreamin' of
And a "Can't stop lovin' you."

Ann-Maria dance to the music and feel fine,...
