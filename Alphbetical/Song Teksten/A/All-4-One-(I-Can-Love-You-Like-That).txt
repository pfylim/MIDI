Oh oh
I know I was wrong 
For treating you the way I did
I had so much on my mind
I'd didn't know where you'd fit in (Where you'd fit in) 
Oh Oh 
And if I could do it all over again, again
I'll never treat you that way
I'll never treat you that way
I apologize for the pain that I've caused
Uh uh abd I just want to say, I just want to say
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For treating you the way I did
I didn't mean it, baby
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For leaving you the way I did
When I close my eyes
I think of how we used to be, we used to be
That's when I realize, just how much you mean to me, you mean to me
Oh Oh a second chance is all that I need, I need
To change what's wrong and make it right
To change what's wrong and make it right
Ah Ah how fool I was to let you slip away
when I know I need you in my life, need you in my life
And oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For treating you the way I did
I didn't mean it, baby
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For leaving you the way I did
And I know every time, every time
Every time I've treated you so unkind, so unkind
You still gave your best to me, to me
I'll do anything to get you back into my life
I need to hold you again, hold you again
Kiss you again, kiss you again
Make love to you, love you
And do it again, do you 
Listen to me, listen to me
Down to my knees, down to my knee
Can we start over again, can we start over
Do be do be doo
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For treating you the way I did
I didn't mean it, baby
Do be do be doo
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For leaving you the way I did
You've got to believe me when I say that
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For treating you the way I did
I'll never never never hurt you baby
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
So sorry, so sorry
For leaving you, for leaving you the way I did
I'm sorry baby.
