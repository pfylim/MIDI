
1. A Horse With No Name - AMERICA

On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things,
There were sand and hills and rings.
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds,
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

Chorus:
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It elt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.
La, la, la, ... .

After nine days I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And the perfect diguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

Chorus

After two days in the desert sun my skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun I was looking at a river bed
And the story is told of a river that flowed 
Made me sad to think it was dead

Chorus
