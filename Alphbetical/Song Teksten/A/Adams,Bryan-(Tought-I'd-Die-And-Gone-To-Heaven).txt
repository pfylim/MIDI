Love is forever - as I lie awake
beside you
I believed - there's no heaven
no hideaway - for the lonely

But I was wrong - crazy
it's gotta be strong
it's gotta be right

Only wanted to stay awhile
only wanted to play awhile
then you taught me to fly like a bird

Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven
such a night I never had before
thought I'd died and gone to heaven
cause what I got there ain't no cure for

Ooo it gets better
it's what you do to me all night angel
I never loved - swear to God
til you came along I never felt this strong

Here I come Baby
it's gotta be strong - it's gotta be right
only wanted to stay awhile
only wanted to play awhile
then you taught me to fly like a bird

Baby - thought I'd died and gone to heaven
such a night I never had before
thought I'd died and gone to heaven
cause what I got there ain't no cure for

I feel fast asleep - I feel drunk
I dream the sweatest dream
never wanna wake up

Never thought it could be this good
you made love to me - the way it oughta be
