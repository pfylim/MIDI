Title  : OH LORI

(Words & music: Billy Alessi/Bobby Alessi)

I'd like to stay in love with you all summer
And after fall I'll keep you warm through the winter
'Cause I've noticed one thing, this ain't no summer fling

I'd like to ride my bicycle with you on the handle bar
You laugh and run away and I chase you through the meadow
Without you I'd die, let's never say goodbye

Chorus:
Oh Lori, you bring the spring the summer
Fall ooh and winter you are the seasons
Oh Lori, you make me feel as though I've been
Born again, born again

You danced for me in your bare feet, that mellow afternoon
When we made love to each other
And I'm loving you, that's all I want to do

Chorus: ...
