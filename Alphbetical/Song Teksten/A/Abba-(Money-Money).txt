Singer : ABBA 
Title  : MONEY, MONEY, MONEY

(Words & music: Andersen/Andersen/Ulvaeus)

I work all night, I work all day
To pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still there never seems to be
A single penny left for me
That's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

Money, money, money, must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money, always sunny
In a rich man's world
Aha, aha, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

A man like that is hard to find
But I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

Money, money, money, must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money, always sunny
In a rich man's world
Aha, aha, all the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world
