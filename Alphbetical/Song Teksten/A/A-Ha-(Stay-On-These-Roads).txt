A-HA - STAY ON THESE ROADS

The cold had a voice
It talks to me
Still born by choice
It airs no need to hold
Old man feels the cold
Oh baby don't 'cause I've been told
Stay on these roads
We shall meet I know
Stay on my love
We shall meet
I know, I know

Where yo should reign
These skies retrain
Shadow your love
The voice trails off again
The voice trails off again

Old man feels the cold
Oh baby's don't 'cause I've been told
Stay on these roads
We shall meet I know
Stay on my love
You feel  so weak be strong
Stay on stay on
We shall meet
I know I know
I know my love I know

Feel the cold
Winter's calling at my home
Stay on these roads
We shall meet I know
Stay on my love
We will meet I know so
Stay on my love
We will meet I know so
Stay on I know
Stay my love stay on
We will meet
I know I know I know
