Singer : AMERICAN GYPSY 
Title  : YO-YO

(Words & music: S. Clisby/M. Hamanel/I. Skeete)

I didn't know you were a creeper
And rocked the cradle while I was sleepin'
I went around the world
Your tricks was no joke
You used me too much mama
And now the string is broke

Chorus:
You got me spinnin' like a yo-yo
'Round and around and around and around we go
You got me spinnin' like a yo-yo
'Round and around and around and around we go

I didn't know our new beginnin'
Would wind me up and keep me spinnin'
You walked me like a dog
And that was the end
But you throw me down this time girl
And I won't come back again

Chorus: ...

Sure been delicious
Sure been delicious to me
Sure been delicious
Sure been delicious to me

Chorus: ...
