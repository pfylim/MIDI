ALPHAVILLE - BIG IN JAPAN

Winter's city side
Crystal bits of snowflakes all around my head
and in the wind
I had no illusions
That I'd ever find a glimpse of summer's
heat waves in your eyes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history, I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Refrain:
Ah, when you're big in Japan tonight
Big in Japan, be tight
Big in Japan, the eastern sea's so blue
Big in Japan
Pay, then I'll sleep by your side
Things are easy when you're big in Japan
Oh, when you're big in Japan

Neon on my naked skin
Passing silhouettes of strange
illuminated mannequins
Shall I stay here at the zoo
Or should I go and change my point of
view for other ugly scenes
You did what you did to me
Now it's history I see
Here's my comeback on the road again
Things will happen while they can
I will wait here for my man tonight
It's easy when you're big in Japan

Refrain: ...
