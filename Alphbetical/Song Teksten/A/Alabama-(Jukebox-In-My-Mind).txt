  9. JUKEBOX IN MY MIND - ALABAMA
  
  In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox
  It's playing all my favourite memories
  One by one they take me back
  To the days when you were mine
  And I can't stop this jukebox in my mind.
  
  I don't need no quarters  Don't need any dimes
  You filled it up forever
  When you said good-bye
  Heaven knows I love old melodies
  They were meant to ease the pain
  But the kind that's playing on my mind
  Are driving me insane.

  Song by song those melodies
  Were meant to ease the pain
  But the kind that's playing on my mind
  Are driving me insane.

  No, I can't stop this jukebox in my mind.
