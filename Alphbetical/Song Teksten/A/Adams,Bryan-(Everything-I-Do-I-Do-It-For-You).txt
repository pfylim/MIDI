       Everything I do              Brian Adams



Look in to my eyes, you will see what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul, when you'll find
me you'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
Can't tell me it's not worth dying for
You know it's true that everything I do, I do it for you

Look in to your heart you will find 
there's nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I will give it up, i would sucrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
You know it's true that everything I do, I do it for you 

There's no love, like your love 
And no other could give more love
There's no way unless you're there
All the time, all the way- year
( look in to my heart babe )
 
Oh you can't tell me it's not worth trying for
I can't help it, there's nothing I want more
Yeah I would figth for you, I lie for you,
Walk a while for you, yeah I die for you...
You know it's true, everything I do- oh- I do it for you
