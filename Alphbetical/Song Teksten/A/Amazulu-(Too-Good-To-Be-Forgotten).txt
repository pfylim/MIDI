AMAZULU - TOO GOOD TO BE FORGOTTEN

Too good to be forgotten
Too good to be forgotten
Benny was the boy I met
While walking home one day
He made me forget my marbles
He said he had another game to play
One thing led to another
Now what more can I say?
Just one of the reasons
Why I got him by my side today

He's just too good to be forgotten
That's all I can say
Too good to be forgotten
No, I'll never let him get away

One in a million people
Shout it from the highest steeple
He's just one of the few
Got my mind, got my life wrapped up in love

Well, his hair was shiny, long and black
It smelled so sweet and bright
I thought of him and dreamed of him
All night after night
I love the ground he walks on
The very air he breathes
I ain't never leaving
'Cause I am-a happy as-a I can say
