ARCADIA - ELECTION DAY

Wild kind of look to the day
opening eyes impale neon flickers
She moon she turning away, the city's
her slave but he's cheating his mistress
She's moody and grey, she's mean and
she's restless (so restless)
All over you as they say rumors
or rivals yell at the strike force
Hi guys, by the way, are you aware
you're being illegal
It's making your saviour
behavior look evil
'Scuse my timing but say, now
d'you fit in with this film, flam and Judy

Maximum big surprise your smile is something new
I pull my shirt off and pray, we're sacred and bound
to suffer the heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray we're coming up
on re-election day

Don't even try to include, in all my restrain
there's no hesitation
All the signs on the loose 'cause
Sanities rare this end of the hard day (Yeh)
Shadows are crawling out of the subway
Any way that you choose in every
direction just to confuse me

Maximum big surprise she knows something new
I pull my shirt off and pray, we're sacred and bound
to suffer the heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray we're coming up
on re-election day

By roads and backways a lover's chance down wind
Cut open murmurs and sounds becalm hands on skin
Carry further oh...entangled strands all sing
Saving some time to slip away we could dance oh ...

Shouldn't be asking wild and scheming
Could be my election day

Stretching my luck down the way
To your invitation stretching my body
Use your intuitive play
'Cause maybe we have more playtime than money

Maximum big surprise you know something new
I pull my shirt off and pray, we're sacred and bound
to suffer this heat wave
Pull my shirt off and pray we're coming up
on re-election day

Re-election day
