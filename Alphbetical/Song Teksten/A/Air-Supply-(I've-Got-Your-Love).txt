I've got your love I don't know how we did it
I don't know why it seemed so long
I've got your love I don't know why you hid it
I'v never felt like this before.

I won't fall in love
you said it so sure
you haven't noticed you never say that any more.

I've got your love
and it's a perfect reason for understanding
life some more.

Burnt your fingers before
burnt your fingers before.

I've got your love I don't know how we did it
I don't know why it seemed so long
I've got your love it's such a total feeling
I don't know where it all began

I won't fall in love
you said it so sure
you haven't noticed you never say that any more.

I've got your love
and if I lose all others
I know it wouldn't hurt at all
I've got your love I don't know we did it
I don't know why it seemed so long.

I've got your love I've got your love
I don't know why it seemed so long.
I'm dreaming my life away.
I need you so that I could die,
I love you so and that is why
