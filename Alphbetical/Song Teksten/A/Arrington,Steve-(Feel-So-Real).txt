STEVE ARRINGTON - FEEL SO REAL

Feel (feel feel feel feel)
Feel (feel feel feel feel)
Feel (feel feel feel feel)

Refrain:
Feel so real
I feel so real
I feel so real
And I owe it all to you

Oh I feel so nice
With you here by my side
If I just do the best that I can do
It seems that's enough for you
The little things mean so much
A smile of a joyful touch
That push that keeps me going strong
To know that I belong and I

Refrain: ...

Love is such a wonderful thing
The angels sing when freedom rings
Freedom from the chains that hold
us back from harmony
I'm right here on my knees
To thank you for the air that I breath
I thank you for the life that you have saved
That's why I've got to say

Refrain: ...

Feel so real feel so real
Feel so real feel so real

Don't you know (feel so real)
Nothing but the truth (feel so real)
It's all for you let me tell you (aah)
I owe it all to you
