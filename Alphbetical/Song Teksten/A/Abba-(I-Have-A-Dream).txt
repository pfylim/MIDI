I HAVE A DREAM - ABBA

Intro

Vers 1:
I have a dream, a song to sing,
to help me cope  with anything.
If you see the wonder  of a fairy tale,
you can take the future  even if you fail.

Refrain:
I believe in angels,
something's good in everything I see.
I believe in angels,
when I know the time is right for me.
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream.

Vers 2:
I have a dream, a fantasy,
to help me through  reality.
And my destination  makes it worth the while,
pushing through the darkness  still a another mile.

Refrain:
I believe - in angels,
something's good in everything I see.
I believe in angels,
when I know the time is right for me.
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream.
I'll cross the stream - I have a dream.

Instrumental 

Vers 3 (wie Vers 1)
I have a dream, a song to sing,
to help me cope  with anything.
If you see the wonder  of a fairy tale
You can take the future  even if you fail.

Refrain:
I believe - in angels,
something's good in everything I see.
I believe in angels,
when I know the time is right for me.
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream.
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream.
