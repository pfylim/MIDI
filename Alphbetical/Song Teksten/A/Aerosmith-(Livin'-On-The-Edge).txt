 INTRO

 VERSE 1

 There's something wrong with the world today, I don't know what it is
 something's wrong with our eyes
 we're seeing things in a different way, and God knows it ain't His
 it sure ain't No Surprize           (yeah!)

 PSEUDO-CHORUS

 Chorus Pattern (use this many times throughout the song):

 we're Livin' On The Edge
 Livin' On The Edge
 Livin' On The Edge
 Livin' On The Edge

 VERSE 2

 [w/Intro pattern]
 There's something wrong with the world today, the lightbulb's gettin' dim
 there's meltdown in the sky
 if you can judge a wise man by the color of his skin
 then mister you're a better man than I

 [feedback!]

 CHORUS

 Livin' On The Edge     (you can't help yourself from falling)
 Livin' On The Edge     (you can't help yourself at all)
 Livin' On The Edge     (you can't stop yourself from falling)
 Livin' On The Edge

 BRIDGE

 tell me what you think about your situation, complication, aggravation
 it's getting to you
 if Chicken Little tells you that the sky is fallin, even if it wasn't
 would you still come crawling back again?
 I bet you would, my friend
 again and again and again and again [and again]

 [Guitar Solo]

 [Repeat BRIDGE]

 VERSE 3

 there's something right with the world today,
 and everybody knows it's wrong
 well we could tell 'em no, we could let it go
 but I would rather be hangin' on!

 [pause]

 [Repeat CHORUS]
