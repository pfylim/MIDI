Titel:            HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN

Interpret:        THE ANIMALS



1:
There is a house in New Orleans
they call the Rising Sun
and it's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
and God, I know I'm one.

2:
My mother was a tailor,
sewed my blue jeans.
My father was a gamblin' man,
down in New Orleans.

3:
Now the only thing a gambler needs
is a suitcase and a trunk.
and the only time he'll be satisfied
is when he's all adrunk.

4:
Oh ! Mother, tell your children,
not to do what I have done.
Spend your lives in sin and misery
in the house of the Rising Sun.

5:
Well I've got one foot on the platform
the other foot on the train.
I'm going back to New Orleans
to wear that ball and chain.
