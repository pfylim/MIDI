Title  : THE NAME OF THE GAME

(Words & music: Andersson/Anderson/Ulvaeus)

I've seen you twice
In a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me
For every time
I'm getting more open hearted

I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think
I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

Chorus:
What's the name of the game
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game
Can you feel it the way I do?

Tell me please
'Cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child
Beginning to grow

And you make me talk
And you make me feel
And you make me show
What I'm trying to conceal
If I trust in you
Would you let me down
Would you laugh at me

If I said I care for you
Could you feel the same way too
I wanna know
What's the name of the game

I have no friends
No one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here
Talking to you
No wonder I get excited

Your smile
And the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling
You gimme no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

Chorus: ...
