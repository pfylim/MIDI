ALISHA - BABY TALK

It's too bad not to know
I don't know I hurt you so
Baby talk to me
I am so sad I can't wait
Baby please don't hesitate
Baby talk to me
You never tried to talk your feelings through
Communication starts from me to you
We have to talk it through to clear the air
We have got to talk to show the love we share

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt
Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk

Baby please talk to me
Can't you see you're hurting me
Baby talk to me
You can't see all this through
Talk will help both me and you
Baby talk to me
It's hard to talk when things are going wrong
We have to talk them out before too long
So honey let's not throw our love away
Let's try to work it out before too late

Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk
I know without a doubt
Baby talk
We can work it out
Baby talk

You don't have to worry baby
You don't have to fear
Tell me of the things you feel
And I will make you care
You just need to tell me baby what I need to say
I need to let you love me baby in that special way

You just need to tell me baby what I need to say
I need to let you love me baby in that special way
