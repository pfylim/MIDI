YESTERDAY MAN - Chris Andrews

I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
That's what I am
Her yesterday man.

That is the look of love she had last night.

Please tell me something
Have you met an angel?
Someone too lovely to live on earth
Well, yesterday I thought I met an angel
But she wasn't worth all she seemed to be worth
And oh, what a fool I have been
I was sure taken in .

Now, I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
That's what I am
Her yesterday man.

That is the look of love she had last night.

Get some of the good kind
And some of the bad kind
Some of the others are in between
But all that I can say is she is the worst kind
Well, I think you know what I mean
And yet for all that I say
I'd take her back any day.

Now I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
I'm her yesterday man
Well my friends, that's what I am
That's what I am
Her yesterday man.

That is the look of love she had last night.
Oh, come a little bit closer baby
(That is the look of love she had last night)
Don't give it to me, you're gonna leave me again, believe me
(That is the look of love she had last night)
I know that, I know that, I know that, I know that
(That is the look of love she had last night)
Babe, I know...
