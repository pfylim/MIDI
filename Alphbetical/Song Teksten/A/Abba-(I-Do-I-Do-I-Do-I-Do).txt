Singer : ABBA 
Title  : I DO, I DO, I DO, I DO


Love me or leave me
Make your choice, but believe me
I love you, I do I do I do I do I do
I can't conceal it
Don't you see, can't you feel it
Don't you too I do I do I do I do I do

Oh I've been dreaming
Through my lonely past
Now I just made it
I found you at last
So come on now let's try it
I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true I do I do I do I do I do

Oh no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it
But just wait and see

So come on now let's try it
I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true I do I do I do I do I do

Let's go together every day will be better
I love you, I do I do I do I do I do
Leave it or take it
I believe we can make it
Don't you too I do I do I do I do I do
