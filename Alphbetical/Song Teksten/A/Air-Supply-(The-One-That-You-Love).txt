Now the night has gone
Now the night has gone away...
doesn't seem that long
we hardly had two words to say...
hold me in your arms
for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
oh...
we have the right you know
we have the right you know.

Don't say the mornings come
Don't say the mornings come so soon...
must we end this way
when so much here is hard to lose...
love is everywhere
I know it is
such moments as this
are too few
oh...
it's all up to you
it's all up to you...
here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways
ah...

Tell me we can stay
Tell me we can stay oh please...
they are the words to say
the only words I can believe...
hold me in your arms
for just another day
I promise this one will go slow
oh...
we have the right you know
we have the right you know.

Here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways
here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways
the night has gone 
a part of yesterday.

I don't know what to say...
I don't know what to say...
here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways...
here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways...
here I am
the one that you love
askin' for another day
understand the one that you love
loves you in so many ways...
