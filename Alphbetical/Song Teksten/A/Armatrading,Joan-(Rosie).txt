Title  : ROSIE

(Words & music: Joan Armatrading)

He has little red feet
His stockin's in his shoes
Lipstick and roughe on his face
He has his hair piled high
Has a red umbrella and carries his head in the sky
And I said: Awe Rosie, don't you do that to the boys
Don't you come on so willin'
Don't you come on so strong
It can be so chillin'
When you act so willin'
And your warmth sets like the sun

He has a little baby brother
A big fat mama
His sister asks for dimes on the street
He doesn't feel it's a cover
In fact he know
For sure he can please

I said: he's out there right now
Runnin' with the devil
Struttin down the alley ways
With the nervous young hopeful at his heel
And knows his satisfaction won't drive him away
And I say: Awe Rosie, don't you do that to the boys
Don't you come on so willin'
Don't you come on so strong
It can be so chillin'
When you act so willin'
And your warmth sets like the sun

He's not looking for a friend
Not lookin' for a lover
There in the crowded bar
He has rings on his fingers
He's there to tease
Ya know he only wants to take things too far
And I said: Awe Rosie, don't you do that to the boys
Don't you come on so willin'
Don't you come on so strong
It can be so chillin'
When you act so willin'
And your warmth sets like the sun
