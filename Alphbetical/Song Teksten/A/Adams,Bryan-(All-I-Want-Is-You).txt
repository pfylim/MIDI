Don't want diamonds don't want gold
don't want fashion don't wanna be cool
don't wanna hustle just to get thru
when it all comes down babe
all I want is you

Don't wanna argue don't wanna fight
don't want no politics babe all thru the night
I told ya before-gonna tell ya once more
for the last time baby open up your door

All I want is you all I want is you
not any old girl will do
all I want is you
If ya don't need love ya gotta be nuts
the heaviest metal always rusts
just you and me babe hangin' tough
it's gotta be it's gotta be it's gotta be love or bust !

Don't need a doctor don't need a nurse
don't need a prescription babe
only make me feel worse

Don't need a license don't need insurance
don't need a ticket where we're goin' babe
you got my assurance ya
I told ya before-gonna tell ya once more
for the last time baby open up your door

All I want is you all I want is you
not any old girl will do
all I want is you
If ya don't need love ya gotta be nuts
the heaviest metal always rusts
just you and me babe hangin' tough
it's gotta be it's gotta be it's gotta be love or bust !
