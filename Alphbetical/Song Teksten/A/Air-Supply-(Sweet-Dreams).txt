This is the time when you need a friend
you just need someone near
I'm not looking forward to the night I'll spend
thinking of you when you're not here
how many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do
always denied the right to live my life the way I want
I want to share it with you.

Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
in my sweet dreams
close your eyes I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams.

I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
and I'll write the words you love
and what I can't say in a letter
will just have to wait till I get home

There's no much time to tell you half
the things I should
only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
and I'd do it again if I could.

Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
in my sweet dreams
close your eyes I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams.

Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
in my sweet dreams
close your eyes I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams.

Sleep like a child resting deep
you don't know what you give me I keep
for these moments alone.

Close your eyes I want to ride the skies
in my sweet dreams
close your eyes I want to see you tonight
in my sweet dreams.
