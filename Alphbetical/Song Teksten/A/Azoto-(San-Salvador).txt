Title  : SAN SALVADOR
Artist : AZOTO

(Words & music: Julie Scott/Celso Valli)

Let me take you to a place I know
Where everything is fine
There together even for a night
Just colours up your mind
Haven't been there many times before
But I remember everyone brother in San Salvador

No one cares about what day it is
Or even 'bout the time
We can wander down the dusty ways
As full as they are mine
Lookin' at the stars they smile and touch you
Sayin' you've fallen in love with San Salvador

San Salvador
Hear the voices ringin' people singing
San Salvador
Now the festival is just beginning
San Salvador
Come and join us in the crowded streets
San Salvador
Feeling happiness inside you

See the stream of light surround us
Passing down to the cafe
The air is fresh and you can guess
Love's with us in every way
If you cathch the spell of magic nights
Throw a coin into the fountain
The fountain of San Salvador

Runnin' down the steps to find the fair
Buy ribbons for your hair
Feelin' the caress of a pale white moon
She dares to laugh and play
From far away we can hear her say
Another day will make us believe
We're in San Salvador
