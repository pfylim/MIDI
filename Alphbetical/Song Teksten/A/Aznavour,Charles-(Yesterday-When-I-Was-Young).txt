Yesterday when I was young, the  taste of life was
sweet as rain upon my tongue,
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame;
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things
I planned I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand;
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day,
and only now I see how the years ran away.
Yesterday when I was young, so many drinking songs
were waiting to be sung, so many wayward pleasures 
lay in store for me, and so much pain
my dazzled eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out,
I never stopped to think what life was all about,
and ev'ry conversation I can now recall concerned
itselfe with me and nothing else at all.

Yesterday the moon was blue and ev'ry crazy day 
brought something new to do,
I used my magic age as if it were a wand, 
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond;
the game of love I played with arrogance and pride,
and ev'ry flame I lit to quickly, quickly died;
The friends I made all seemed some how to drift away,
and only I am left on stage to end the play.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung,
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue,
the time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.
