Tommy was a guy of twenty one 
He left school a year too soon 
'Cause he would try to change his life

He gathered lots of fame and dough 
Till he met that beauty queen 
Who hated racings so

It kept going on in his mind 
Take care, beware, take care 
The same words were all he could find 
Take care, beware, take care 
Her voice echoed in his head 
If he'd known it all before 
He'd drive no racing car 
If he'd known it all before 
He'd drive no racing car 
 
Sandy was her name and he loved her so 
She wouldn't see his way of life 
Every time he left for his next big race 
She told him darling please survive 
It gave him so much pain to see her cry 
And then he didn't watch the track 
The car spinned round and hit the rail 
He nearly broke his neck 
 
Refrain: ...
