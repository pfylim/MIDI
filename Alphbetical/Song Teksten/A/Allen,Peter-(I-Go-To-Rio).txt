Title  : I GO TO RIO

(Words & music: Peter Allen/Adrienne Anderson)

When my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio De Janeiro me o, me o
I go wild and then I have to do the samba
And La Bamba
Now I'm not the kind of person
With the passion and persuasion
For dancin' or romancin'
But I give into the rhythm and my
Feet follow the beating of my heart

Woah when my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I go to Rio De Janero
I'm a salsa fellow
When my baby smiles at me
The lightning of my life
And I am free at last
What a blast

Woh when my baby
When my baby smiles at me
I feel like Tarzan of the jungle
There on the hot sand
And in a bungalow our monkeys
Play above
We'll make love
Now I'm not the type to let vibrations
Trigger my imagination easily
You know that's just not me
But I turn into a tiger every time
I get beside the one I love

When my baby ...etc...
