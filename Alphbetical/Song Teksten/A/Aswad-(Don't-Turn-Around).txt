ASWAD - DON'T TURN AROUND

Woah, woah, woah, woah
If you wanna leave baby
I won't beg you to stay
And if you wanna go darling
Maybe it's better that way
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out the door
See if I care
Go on and go now but

Refrain:
Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me crying
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
And I won't let you know
Baby I won't let you know

I won't miss your arms around me
Holding me tight ooh
And know that I'm gonna be alright ooh
I'm gonna be strong
I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
I know I'll survive yeah
I'll make it through
And I'll even learn to live without you but

Refrain: ...

I wish I could scream out loud
That I love you
I wish I could say to you
Don't go don't go don't go
Don't turn around girl ooh oh
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me crying
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go
Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me crying
Just walk away
It's tearing me apart that you're leaving
I'm letting you go

Don't you turn around
