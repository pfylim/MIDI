Now you tell me that the time is right
you've let your feeling go
and you know I won't use them up too fast
I can't promise you the best there is
but ooh, I'm gonna try
I'm never gonna let you go tonight.

Tonight, the start of a love to remember
tonight, a love that will never be ended
tonight, tonight.

Let me take you where there's no return
where dreams can all come true
I've got the feeling we've been holding on too long
what we're feeling is ours alone
no one will ever know
just how we feel about tonight.

Tonight, the start of a love to remember
tonight, a love that will never be ended
tonight, tonight.

How many times has love fallen through
when I left it all up to you
I took your words when you said
it's got to be just right
I need you now I need you now.

Tonight, the start of a love to remember
tonight, a love that will never be ended
tonight, tonight.
