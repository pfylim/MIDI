Title  : LITTLE DARLIN'

(Words & music: Eddie Holland/Lamond Dozier/Brian Holland)

It's so hard loving you
But I don't wanna let you go

Chorus:
Little darlin', I need you
Little darlin', I love you
Little darlin', I want you
Little darlin', got to have you

And if it means giving up my pride
I'm willing to give it up, give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
I don't mind, I don't mind
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

Chorus: ...

I know there's two or three
In you, life you like as well as me
So if I should be your number one fool
Before you care about me
And I'm willing to pay the price
Be your number one fool make that sacrifice

Chorus: ...

Only my pillow knows how many tears
I've cried baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt
I feel inside baby
My life is so lonely
Waiting for you to love me only
Now I'm willing to pay the price
Be your number one fool at any sacrifice

Chorus: ...
