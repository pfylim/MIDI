ASHFORD & SIMPSON - SOLID

Refrain 1:
And for love's sake
Each mistake you forgave
And soon both of us
Learn to trust

Not run away
It was no time to play
We built it up
Built it up, built it up

Refrain 2:
And now it's solid
Solid as a rock
That's what this love is
That's what we've got
Solid, solid as a rock
And nothing's changed it
The thrill is still hot, hot, hot

You didn't turn away
When the sky went grey
Somehow we managed
We had to stick together

You didn't bat an eye
When I made you cry
We knew down the line
We would make it better

Refrain 1 + 2: ...

Knock knock on wood
You understood
Love was so new
We did what we had to do

And with that feeling
We were willing to take a chance
So against all odds
We made a start
We got serious
This wouldn't turn to dust
We build it up
Build it up, build it up

Refrain 2: ...

Solid solid solid ...
