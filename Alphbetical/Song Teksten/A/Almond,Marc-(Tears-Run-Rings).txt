MARC ALMOND - TEARS RUN RINGS

(Words & music: Mark Almond)

On heavenly rain
You fell into my life
Unforgettable smile
Unforgettable lies
In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust

Refrain:
The angels sighed
A little girl cried
The tears run rings around my eyes

We're going to set fire
To the house in my heart
We're going to set fire
To the whole damn world
I don't understand
The wicked things we do
In the name of the good
In the name of the few

Refrain: ...

Don't look up to me
With your innocent smile
When the bed is burning
Around my head
When a bar breaks out
It'll be no surprise
Unforgettable smile
Unforgettable lies
And I've got to stop running
To make my start
We've got to get together
Before we fall apart

They're pulling down the old slums
To build the new
They're bringing back the old rules
To please the few
In the name of the cross
Or a banner of love
With the hand of a friend
Or under a blanket of trust

Refrain: ...
Pull down the old slums
To build the new
Pull down the love
I built with you
Promise of tomorrow
You never kept
And you try to burn the house down
When I slept
The nation is disorder
There's chaos in my heart
We've got to get together
Before we fall apart

Refrain: ...
