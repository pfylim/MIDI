          Don't Worry                 Kim Appleby


In no time you'll be fine, Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.
You meet a guy he said he was your lover,
He said he loved you like no other.
He told you that you where the only one,
How could he say that when he's having so much fun.
Now he say's you're making him sad.
Now he say's that when he treats you so bad,
Now he's gone and left you for another.
You're not the first you now discover.
Don't you cry, you'll get by,
You'll be back on your feet,
In no time you'll be fine, don't worry.
You got hurt, you got hurt,
You're not the first, your heart eaches,
It won't last, it will pass don't worry.
Don't waste your time, thinking of the past,
Love like that it could never last give.
Don't you know things happen for reason,
It's meant to be just like the change of season.
You're not to blame, don't you feel so bad,            
He was the one who was making you sael.
Now he's gone left you for another,
It's for the best you will discover.
Standing all on my own,
Love will never be the same without him,
Trying hard to be strong,
How can I go on now he's gone.
