Where are all the tricks that people play
when they're afraid to say
I want you to hold on to me
if I let you go again tonight
whose arms will keep me warm
and take me where I long to be
but if I lose and then surrender all I know
what could I do if you decided to let go
hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone
my head down in my hands
just wondering why.

This heart belongs to me
and I know what I believe
but now it longs to be
only with you.

Where are all the words I sometimes say
when I'm afraid to ask
I want you to hold on to me
anyway you want to let me know
you're sharing my belief
of wanting to hold on to me
I tell the truth and risk you running from my life
so much to lose and yet
you know how hard I try
hopelessly I'd stand there with everything all gone
my head down in my hands
just wondering why.

This heart belongs to me
and I know what I believe
but now it longs to be
only with you.

My love it goes to only one, this heart belongs to me
my love it goes to only one, this heart belongs to me
my love this heart belongs to me
my love this heart belongs to me.

This heart belongs to me
and I know what I believe
but now it longs to be
only with you.
