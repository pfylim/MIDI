Singer : ABBA
Title  : S.O.S.

Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find
I try to reach for you, but you have closed my mind
Whatever happened to our love, I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

Refrain:
So when you're near me
darling, can't you hear me, S.O.S.
The love you gave me
nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
though I try, how can I carry on

You seem so far away, though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died, I fear
I really understood to make it out, I wish you understood
What happened to our love, it used to be so good

Refrain: ...
