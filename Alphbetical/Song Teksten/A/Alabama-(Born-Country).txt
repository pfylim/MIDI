
6. BORN COUNTRY - ALABAMA

Clear creeks and cool mountain mornings
Honest work out in the fields.
Cornbread in my Mama‹s kitchen.
Daddy‹s saying grace before the meal.
Family ties run deep in this land
And I‹m never really far from what I am.

Chorus:
I was born country and that‹s what I‹ll always be
Like the rivers and the woodlands wild and free.
I got a hundred years of down home
Running through my blood.
I was born country and this country is what I love.

Moonlight and you here beside me.
Crickets serenading in the yard.
What more could two people ask for.
Playing here in love beneath the stars.
And this is where I wanna raise my kids.
Just the way my Mum and Daddy did.

Chorus (2 times)
