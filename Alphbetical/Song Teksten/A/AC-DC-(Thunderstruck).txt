Ah Thunderstruck
Ah Thunderstruck
Thunder thunder thunder thunder
I was caught
In the middle of a railroad track(thunder)
I looked round
And I knew there was no turnin' back(thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do(thunder)
And I knew
There was no help no help from you(thunder)
Sound of drums
Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns tore me apart
You've been thunderstruck
--------------------------------------------------------
Rode down the highway
Broke the limit we hit the ton
Went through to Texas yeah Texas
And we had some fun
We met some girls
Some danceers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules
Played all the fools yeah yeah
They they they been our minds
I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again please
Yeah them ladies were too kind
You've been thunderstruck
Thunderstruck
Yeah yeah yeah thunderstruck
ooh thunderstruck(yeah)
--------------------------------------------------------
I was shakin' at the knees
Could I come again please
--------------------------------------------------------
