WHISTLE - JUST BUGGIN'

REFRAIN:
We're called Whistle and this is true
We love to do the things that we're not supposed to do
We don't mean robbing, stealing or mugging
In fact don't take it seriously we're only buggin'

Party people in the place we want you all to see
That we can be taken seriously
But if you don't believe that
Then forget you all
'Cause we're gonna party, party and have a ball
'Cause we're here to prove through bugged out means
That things aren't always what they seem
We want you all to scream
And start to shout
As we go on our mission and bug on out

Well it's all about us, jazz KD
But sometimes it's all about just me
You know what I notice all of a sudden
When I speak people dis'Ef Hutton
There's not another person who sounds like me
Injupitably, there would never be

I say a tongue twister like the blink of an eye
Say it so well you wouldn't think it's a lie
Lie
Peter Proper picked up his golden pen
Put it on a pedestal
And pursued his friend
His plot to play, the polluted punk
Persisted to prohibit, so the plotters plan flunked
My problem with pledging plenty people who plead
Is play the proper part without a picture of greed
And my present plague procrastinates my plea
So I'm the perfect pacemaker
Perpetrators praise me

REFRAIN: ...

Tell me girl now is it true
That you'd love for me just to talk to you
For you to be my girl and I'll be your man
You'd be mine and not just another fan
You'd be with me everywhere I go
You'd hold my hand at every show
Inseparable is what we'd be
Jazz and Jazotto eternally
But after all of this
You know the dream world end
I wouldn't talk to you
I talk to your friend
And you'd call me concealed
And you'd call me wrong
And you'd call me all night
And try to turn me on
Well you'd dial my digits
In the day and late at night
And promise and swear that you'd, do me right
But I doubt that anything that you'd do
Would ever give me the stomach to talk to you
So now I'm buggin'
Some DJ's go... In order to Impress
But DJ's silver spinner is really fresh
He has a trick up his sleeve
And if that isn't enough
Crab a front row seat and check out his stuff
When the place gets hot and the air gets thinner
The mutilator on the tables is the silver spinner
His scratches fascinate us
So why don't you reveal it
Make it hard enough
So everybody can feel it
