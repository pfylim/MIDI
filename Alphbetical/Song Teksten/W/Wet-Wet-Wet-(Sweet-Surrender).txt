WET WET WET - SWEET SURRENDER

(Words & music: Clark/Pellow/Cunningham/Mitchell)

Hey, hey, little fella
Get your show together
I was listening in before
Now I don't care no more
Look around now (look around now)
It's only that it's gonna get me down
It's only begun yeah

One look is all it took
Ooh I remember that sweet surrender
I recall do you
That sweet surrender
Sweet surrender

My determination
Came a-creeping across the nation (ooh ooh ooh)
A sure mistake for anyone
So you can't take home everyone
'Cause it's only just begun oh oh oh

One look is all it took
Ooh to remember that sweet surrender
An' I recall do you
That sweet surrender
I don't know, I don't care
'Cause I'm living without you baby
Even when I know what's going on yeah
It only took one look, one glance
Ooh to set my heart set for romance
Do you believe
My sweet surrender
My sweet surrender

Listen, hey little fella
Hey now your show's together
I never wanted you to listen before
So why should I walk out the door
Stick around now (stick around now)
And so the story goes on through the night
It's only begun

One look is all it took
Ooh I remember that sweet surrender
And do you recall 'cause I do
My sweet surrender

I don't know, I don't care
'Cause I'm living without you baby
Even when I know what's going on yeah

It only takes one look
One glance
Ooh t set my heat for romance

One look is all it took
My sweet surrender
My sweet surrender, yeah
One look is all it took to remember
One look ( I don't know)
Is all it took (I don't care) to remember
To remember
(I don't know, I don't care) yeah
