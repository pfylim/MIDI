Title  : MEMORY OF LIFE

(Words & music: H. Vermeulen)

I walk through the streets and I look around
I'm coming back after so many years
Oh yes, this is my home town
It all looks the same
All these things I remember so well
A friend that I played with
The tree that I climbed
And the hundreds of times that I fell
And then I don't know what to say
'Cause there I face my memory of life
I see them all
And I hear them call
I hope they don't see the tears in my eyes
But wait I hear your voice
And I see your eyes
Ooh, it's so good to be back in your arms
And to feel you so close by my side
So come and take my hand
Just to lead me away
To the fields where we wonder and where we made love
And 'cause I've got so much to say
My hands are getting cold
'Cause now they hold my memory of life
I hear you call
Yes I hear it all
I hope you don't see the tears in my eyes
And then what do I feel
Some one touches my hand
Hey wake up buddy
Get into your home
'Cause they stopped that shooting again
And then without something to say
You drift away my memory of life
No one to hold no one at all
No one to see the tears in my eyes
