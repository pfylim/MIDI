1. Another Day - Whigfield

Well you got me boy
Feeling just like a fool
Hey I'm not your toy
Don't you treat me cruel
Don't you stop me now
Doing what I want to do
For you're out of line.

Now this life is mine
I can do it alone
And I'm feeling fine
Now I'm here on my own
Don't you see my eyes
Are looking round for something new
For you're out of line
I can't live another day with you

Another day with you

Well I've seen the light
And I'm getting up soon
'Cause you've tired me out
And my loving is through
I can tell no lies there is nothing left for you
For you're out of line.

Now this life is mine
I can do it alone
And I'm feeling fine
Now I'm here on my own
Don't you see my eyes
Are looking round for something new
For you're out of line
I can't live another day with you
Another day with you

Another another another
Another day with you
With you
Another day with you
Wowowowow...
Ohoh this life is mine

Now this life is mine
I can do it alone
And I'm feeling fine
Now I'm here on my own
Don't you see my eyes are looking round for something new
For you're out of line
I can't live another day with you
With you
Another day with you
With you
Another day with you.

Another day another day ohoh
Another day with you
Another day another day
No no no no no no no no no
Ohoh
Another day with you
No no
I can't live another day with you
Another day another day with you
Another day with you
Ohoo with you
Another day with you.
