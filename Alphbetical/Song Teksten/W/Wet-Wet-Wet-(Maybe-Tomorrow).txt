She's getting out of control
she takin' my soul
and won't let it go

I'm going out of my mind
she's wastin' my time
but I won't let it show
no no
you want it all
you got it all
you want it all
just so you can have it
and baby I'm sending you a line

Maybe tomorrow
maybe tonight
baby it's always
clean out of sight

She thinks I'm digging her scene
I'm breaking it clean
so I ought to let her know

I'm holding out my hand

Losing touch with each caress

Love'n' Bitterness

You want it all
you got it all
you want it all
just so you can have it
and baby I'm sending you a line

Maybe tomorrow
maybe tonight
baby it's always
clean out of sight

You want it all
you got it all
you want it all
just so you can have it
and baby I'm sending you a line

Maybe tomorrow
maybe tonight
baby it's always
clean out of sight
