Title  : GETTING CLOSER

(Words & music: Paul McCartney)

Say you don't love him
My salamander
Why do you need him
Oh no don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

Keep ahead of the rain on the road
Watching my windscreen wipers
Radio play me a danceable ode
Cattle beware of snipers

When will you see me
My salamander
Now don't try to tell me
Oh no don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

Hitting the chisel and making a joint
Gluing my fingers together
Radio play me a song with a point
Sailor beware of the weather

I'm getting closer
My salamander
Well when will we be there
Ah no don't answer, oh no
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer to your heart

I'm getting closer to your heart
I'm getting closer to your heart

Closer, closer, closer, closer
Closer, closer, closer, closer
