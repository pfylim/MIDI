Deep in my heart lies a melody,
a song of ols san Antone.
Where in dreams I live with a
memory Beneth the stars all alone.
It was there I found beside the Alamo, 
Enchantment strange as the blue up above.
A moonlit pass that only she would know,
still hears my broken song of love.

Moon in all your splendor, 
know only my heart.
Call back my rose, Rose of San Antone.

Lips so sweet and tender like petals
falling apart.
Speak once again of my love, my own
broken song, empty words I know
still live in my heart all alone.

For that moonlit pass by the alamo and Rose, my Rose of
San Antone.
