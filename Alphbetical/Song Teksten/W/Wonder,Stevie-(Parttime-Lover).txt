STEVIE WONDER - PART TIME LOVER


Call up ring once hang up the phone
To let me know you make it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong
with part time lover

If she's with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and my part time lover

We are under cover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the world's discreet when
part time lovers

But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek it's really you
my part time lover

We are under cover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our door bell
And it was not you
my part time lover

And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part time lovers
You and me, part time lovers
She and he, part time lovers
