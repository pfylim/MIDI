Title  : I Just Called To Say I Love You
Singer : Stevie Wonder


No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered
Candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words
That I must say to you

Chorus:
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light
One tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds
To fly to southern skies

No libra sun, no halloween
No giving thanks to all
The Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart
Like no three words could ever do

Chorus (2x)
Of my heart, of my heart


Words & Music : Stevie Wonder
