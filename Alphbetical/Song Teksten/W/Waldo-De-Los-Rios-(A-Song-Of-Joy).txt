Interpret:    WALDO DE LOS RIOS



Come sing a song of joy for peace shall come, my brother.
Sing, sing a song of joy for men shall love each other.
That day will dawn just as sure as hearts that are purew, are
hearts set free.
No man must stand alone with outstreched hand before him.

Rech out and take them in yours with love that endures for everymore.
Then sing a song of joy for love and understanding.

Vers 2*

Come sing a song of joy and freedom tell the story.
Sing, sing a song of joy for mankind in his glory.
One mighty voice that will breing a sound that will ring for
evermore.
