STEVIE WONDER & MICHAEL JACKSON - GET IT

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

Stevie:
Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
'Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free
And gives her love to me

Michael:
Some thing that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
'Cause she still says
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

Stevie:
No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one who will

Michael:
Gonna get it, her love

Stevie:
Gonna get it, her kisses

Michael:
Gonna get it, her heart

Stevie & Michael:
Gonna get it, get it

Michael:
Miss Lady Girl
Has buried her feelings deep inside
'Cause she don't want
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired
Of being on that lonely merry go round
Sh just don't know
That the ultimate love of her life is
About to be found

Stevie:
They think that ready cash
Flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gonna get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will

Michael:
No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I know that I will be the one
Who will

Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it
Gonna get it
