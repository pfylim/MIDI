Title  : IT'S A LOVE THING
Artist : THE WHISPERS

(Words & music: William Shelby/Dana Meyers)

It's a love thing
It's a love thing
It's a love thing

The look in your eyes
Is more than enough
To make my poor heart
Burst into flames

Knew from the moment we met
That there was no doubt
That my life would never be the same

I could never hide the feelings, that come over me
When you're near me
I know that's how it's suppose to be
My heart keeps telling me

It's a love thing, yeah
Got me taking in my sleep
About the love we made

It's a love thing
It's a love thing
It's a love thing

Such a feeling I get
Whenever we touch
Girl like no other I felt before

It's still so new, and yet I need you so much
Got to make you mine forever more

You're the kinda woman
That can turn my world around
'Cause you show me what a selfish love is all about
Without a doubt

It's a love thing
I feel that pounding in my heart
When you call my name
It's a love thing

It's a love thing
It's a love thing
It's a love thing

Everytime that you're near
It becomes so clear
It's a love thing
It's a love thing
It's a love thing
