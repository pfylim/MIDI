KIM WILDE - THE TOUCH

Funny what fate can bring you
And the things that it can do
Fully how life can change you
When you least expect it to

I wasn't into anyone
I danced in a sea of faces
I wasn't into anything
But baby you know
Together we're

Refrain:
So right
The touch that I get from you's incredible
So right
The touch that I get when I look at you

Maybe the touch you give me
Is the look I get from you
Maybe the spell it's weaving
Is the way you feel it too
Maybe you'll stop and walk away

Don't look at me to follow
I wouldn't run for anyone
But baby you know
Together we're

Refrain: ...

Whatever it is we've got
Well maybe we could find out more about it
Baby we'll create this feeling
Anytime, anywhere

I wasn't into anyone
I danced in a sea of faces
I wasn't into anything
But baby you know
Together we're

Refrain: ...

So right
Together we're so right
So right, so right
