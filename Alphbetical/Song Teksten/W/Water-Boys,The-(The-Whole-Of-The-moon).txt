Title  : The Whole Of The Moon
Singer : The Water Boys


I pictured a rainbow
You held it in your hands
I had flashes but you saw the plan
I wandered out in the world for years
While you just stayed in your room
I saw the crescent
you saw the Whole of the Moon
You were there in the turnstiles
With the wind at your heels
You stretched for the stars
And you know how it feels to reach
Too high too far too soon
You saw the Whole of the Moon
I was grounded while you filled the skies
I was dumbfounded by truth
You cut through lies
I saw the rain dirty valley
You saw Brigadoon I saw the crescent
you saw the Whole of the Moon
I spoke about wings you just flew
I wondered I guessed and I tried
You just knew I sighed
But you swooned! I saw the crescent
You saw the Whole of the Moon
With a torch in your pocket
And the wind at your heels
you climbed on the ladder
And you know how it feels to get
Too high too far too soon
You saw the Whole of the Moon
The whole of the moon
Unicorns and cannonballs palaces and piers
Trumpets towers and tenements
Wide oceans full of tears
Flags rags ferryboats scimitars and scarves
Every precious dream and vision
Underneath the stars
you climbed on the ladder
With the wind in your sails
You came like a comet
Blazing your trail
Too high too far too soon
You saw the Whole of the Moon
