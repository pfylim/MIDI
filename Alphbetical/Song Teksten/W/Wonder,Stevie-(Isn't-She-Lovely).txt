Singer : STEVIE WONDER 
Title  : ISN'T SHE LOVELY

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from us

Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
We have been heaven blessed
I can believe what God has done
Through us He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love
