Title  : I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT
Artist : STEVIE WONDER

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

Don't wanna believe what they're tellin' me
That somebody's been pickin' in my cherry tree
Don't wanna mistrust nobody my mistake
But I hear tell someone's been diggin' round in my cake

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby

Don't wanna believe what somebody said
But somebody said somebody's shoes was under my bed
Don't wanna 'cause nobody no bodily harm
But somebody's been rubbin' on my good luck charm

And I ain't gonna stand for it baby
