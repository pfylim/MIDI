You hear me so clearly
and see how I try
You feel me. So heal me
and tear me apart

I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
do they have to know
about my goodnight girl

caught up in your wishin' well
your hopes and sadness
take your love 'n' promises
and make them last
you make them last

You keep me so near you
and see me so far
and hold me and send me
and deep in your heart

I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
do they have to know
about my goodnight girl

caught up in your wishin' well
your hopes and sadness
take your love 'n' promises
and make them last
you make them last

caught up in your wishin' well
your hopes and sadness
take your love 'n' promises
and make them last
you make them last

It doesn't matter how sad
I made you
doesn't matter how hard I try

Just remember the same
old reason
reflected in your eyes
you said you wanted me

caught up in your wishin' well
your hopes and sadness
take your love'n' promises
and make them last
you make them last

caught up in your wishin' well
your hopes and sadness
take your love 'n' promises
and make them last
you make them last
