Singer : ALBERT WEST 
Title  : SIMONE

Simone, why do you cry
Don't you know your tears will dry
And take away that loneliness
There inside oh if you try
Simone, why do you cry
Don't you know the sun will shine
And on your mirrored soul
You'll find reflections good
Oh I said you would

You've been searchin' everywhere
For something to believe in
You've been searchin'
It's never there
Read your own book and you know

Simone, why do you cry
Don't you know you've got a life
Now don't waste it all inside
Come on Simone, come on Simone
Come on Simone, you're on
Da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da da
