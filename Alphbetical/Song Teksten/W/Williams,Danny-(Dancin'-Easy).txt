Title  : DANCIN' EASY

(Words & music: Gunnings/Eyers/Hill/Grainge)

Dancin' easy, dancin' easy

Close your eyes, and you'll find
When the rhythm takes over your mind
We'll be swaying, music's playing
Dancin' easy

Any time, any place, anywhere
There's a magical world we can share
In a new world, me and you girl
Dancin' easy

Chorus:
Nice and slow, nice and slow
Round and round we go
On a carousel ride of your own
We won't be dancing alone
We won't be dancing alone
We won't be dancing alone

Any time, any place, anywhere
From the day, you know we can stay
In a new world, me and you girl
Dancin' easy

Chorus: ...

Any time, any place, anywhere
There's a magical world we can share
In a new world, me and you girl
Dancin' easy

Any time, any place, anywhere
From the day, you know we can stay
In a new world, me and you girl
Dancin' easy

Any time, any place, anywhere
You can guess, the day you say yes
To a new world, me and you girl

Dancin' easy (10x)
