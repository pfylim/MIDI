Title  : Love Blonde
Singer : Kim Wilde


Something's coming down the street
Something static under your feet
Never looking left or right
'Cos she'll just blow you out of sight

She's never waiting on your smile
Devastating, what's in her style?
Situation no-go zone
But she'll cut loose when she's alone

Chorus:
She's a love blonde (3x)
She's got that sensuality for love

When the boys say "how you been
What you doin', can we get in?"
Eyes'll flash and lips will smile
And she'll just tease them for a while

'Cos now you see her, now you don't
You could be there, only you won't
If you've got that "Savoir faire"
Well, that girl knows and she's aware

Chorus

Oooh, well, if she fills your dreams tonight
Oooh, just lay back and hold on tight

Chorus
