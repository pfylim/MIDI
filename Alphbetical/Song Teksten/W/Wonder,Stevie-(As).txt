Title  : AS        STEVIE WONDER - AS

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows loves the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Choir:
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Always, always, always
Did you know that true love ask for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love
A guarantee to last through forever and another day

Choir:
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high

Always, always, always
Did you know you're loved by somebody
Always
I'll be loving you forever
Always, always, always
