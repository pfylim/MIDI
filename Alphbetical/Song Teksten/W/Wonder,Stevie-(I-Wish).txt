Title  : I WISH

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

Looking back on when I 
Was a little nappy beaded boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes, would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door
To bang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
With boy thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from whippin' your behind

I wish those days, could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days, could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so

Brother say he's telling
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall
(You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it, it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days, could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days, could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so
