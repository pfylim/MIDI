WENDY & LISA - ARE YOU MY BABY

Are you my baby
To my young and foolish heart
Loving has no end
Sometimes people grow apart
That's why I'm wondering
Ooh are you my baby
Or are we just friends?
Oh you make me crazy
Baby baby won't you be my man?
I've had dreams I know won't come true
From them I have grown
But honey if I can't have you I've just got to know
That's why I'm asking
Ooh are you my baby
Or are we just friends?
Oh you make me crazy
Baby baby won't you be my man?
I've had lovers in the past
But it always ends
A love like ours would surely last
Because you are my friend
It's a crazy thing
But of you I sing
I won't be alone
'Cause you are my home
You're my lucky card
'Cause in your love I start
You're my only heart
Can't you feel its crazy beating
Ooh are you my baby
Or are we just friends?
Oh you make me crazy
Baby baby won't you be my man?
