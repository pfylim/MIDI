DANNY WILSON - THE SECOND SUMMER OF LOVE

(Words & music: Gary Clark)

The first summer of love was here
When I was much too young
The first summer of love was clearly
Just a summer long there was
Jesus on the radio
Jesus on the train
Jesus in the calico
Jesus in the rain

And there was love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

The second summer of love is here
So tell your angry friends
To throw away their Gaultier
And grow their hair again
Acid on the radio
Acid on the brain
Acid in the calico
Acid in the rain

And there was love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

There was love all over the country
Singing love all over the world
Acid on the radio
Acid on the brain
Acid everywhere you go
Acid in the rain

And there was love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

And there was love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me

And there was love, love, love, love
Anyone could see that there was love
Love all over me
