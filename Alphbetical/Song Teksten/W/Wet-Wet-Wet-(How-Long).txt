Hey there Mr. Taxi Driver
take me to the station
I've been around for too long

You said I lack understanding
that I don't know right from wrong
but oh no

There's a road that a man has to take
there's a road and it's filled with my mistakes
ooh baby ! Don't you misunderstand me

How long will it take
how long can you wait
tell me how long
tell me how long
How long will it take
how long can you wait
when we are living in a world
of loves imagination

Senorita plays for the people who bother
outside those old department stores
she's singing out loud for no reason
about a travelling man she's been hanging around
but oh no

There's a road that a man has to take
there's a road and it's filled with my mistakes
ooh baby ! Don't you misunderstand me

How long will it take
how long can you wait
tell me how long
tell me how long
How long will it take
how long can you wait
when we are living in a world
of loves 

How long will it take
how long can you wait
tell me how long

So I should beg for some forgiveness
borrowed time
cause someone else can wait that long again
if only you'll be leavin'
tell me just...
how long

How long will it take
how long can you wait
tell me how long
tell me how long
How long will it take
how long can you wait
tell me how long
tell me how long

How long will it take
how long can you wait

How long will it take
how long can you wait
