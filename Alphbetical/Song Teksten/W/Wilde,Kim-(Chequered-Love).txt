Title  : CHEQUERED LOVE
Artist : KIM WILDE

(Words & music: Ricky Wilde/Marty Wilde)

You said ev'rything's all right
I say nothing can go right yeah
Oh waht a game you can play
Sad days add to confusion
But that's the name of the game

Chorus:
Well, I know your love is rough
And the roads you take are tough
But I just can't get enough, chequered love

Touch me, do what you want to
Say no when I just need you, yeah
You're gonna drive me insane
You are men for all seasons
You are men with no reasons, yeah
You're the man with the pain

Chorus: ...

Oh oh oh oh oh I can't let go
Oh oh oh oh oh I can't let go
