Title  : NIGHT TRAIN
Artist : STEVE WINWOOD

(Words & music: Steve Winwood/Will Jennings)

Out of the night
Burning with light
Train shining black
I won't look back
Hoping some day someone will say I got it made
Pull up the shade, let the sun in

Chorus:
Down on the night train
I feel the starlight steal away
Use up a lifetime
Looking for the break of day

Border patrol, looking through me
Towns without names, all look the same
I hear crying

Paris to Spain, countries in pain
Caught up in flight, feeling the sight
Europe dying

Chorus: ...

Rolling on, hear the wheels singing
Fever keeps coming on so strong
My ticket paid, trying to fade
I hope I get there
Not just somewhere
I was leaving

Chorus:

Hard rain following on
Cold wheels moving on
Everybody so alone
Down on the night train
