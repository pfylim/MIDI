KIM WILDE - FOUR LETTER WORD

Ooh ooh ooh ah ah ah
I tell ya it's hell yeah
When love says goodbye
It's a four letter word
Because your heart knows when love goes
The feeling is bad it's the pits of the world
It's sad but true
When nothing you can do can bring it back
Standing in the rain she starts to cry
(Ha ha when love says goodbye)
Is it all a game
She wonders why
Why it had to start
Why should it end and take her apart

Because she shows it
She knows it 
But what can she do it's a four letter word
Because it shakes you it breaks you
And when it's the end
It's the worst thing you heard
It's over now
And nothing you can do can bring it back

Calling out his name she starts to cry
(Ha ha when love says goodbye)
Guys are all the same
No one will see and no one must hear

But oh
How can the love that she has be profane
And how can something that's so beautiful
Just Jekyll and Hyde around
It's too sad
(Ha ha when love says goodbye)
Oh oh oh
(Ha ha when love says goodbye)
Ooh (four letter word)

I tell ya it's hell yeah
When love says goodbye
It's a four letter word
Because your heart knows when love goes
The feeling is bad it's the worst in the world
It's sad but true
When nothing you can do can get it back
Standing in the rain she starts to cry
(Ha ha when love says goodbye)
Shouting out inane oh ah ah ah ah
Tell ya it's hell yeah
