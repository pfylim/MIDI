IT WAS A CLEAR BLACK NIGHT
A CLEAR WHITE MOON
WOMAN G. WAS ON THE STREET
TRYING TO CONSOLE SOME SKIRCH FOR THE HEAT

SO I CAN GET SOME FUN ROLLING IN MY RIDE
TEAMING ALL ALONE
JUST HIT THE EAST SIDE OF LBC
ON A MISSION TRYING TO FIND MR. WARREN G

SEEN A CAR FULL OF GIRLS
AIN'T NO NEED TO TWEAK
ALL YOU SKIRCH KNOW WHAT'S UP
WITH 2-1-3

SO I HOOK SOME LEFT
ON 2-1 AND LEWIS
AND BROTHER'S SHOOTING GUY
SO I SAID "LET'S DO THIS"

I JUMPED OUT THE RIDE
AND SAID "WHAT'S UP"
SOME BROTHER'S PULLED SOME GAS
SO I SAID "I'M STUCK"

SINCE THESE GIRLS ARE PEEPING ME
I'M ALL GLAD AND SWIRL
THESE GIRLS ARE LOOKING SO HARD
THEY STRAIGHT HIT THE KERB

WANTA BIGGER BETTER THINGS
THAN SOME HORNY TRICKS
I SEE MY HOME AND GOT SOME SUPPER
ALL IN HIS MIX

I KEEP FORGETTING WE'RE NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE
I KEEP FORGETTING THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW YOU MADE THAT SO CLEAR
I KEEP FORGETTING NOW

I LAID ALL IN BUSTER'S GOWN
I LET MY GAS EXPLODE
NOW I'M SWITCHING MY MIND BACK
INTO FREAK MODE

IF YOU WON'T SKIRCH
THEN SIT BACK AND OBSERVE
I JUST SLEPT AGAIN A HOSE
OVER AN "A" ON THE KERB

NOW THEY'VE GOT THE FREAKS
AND THAT'S A KNOWN FACT
BEFORE WE GOT JACKED
I WAS ON THE SAME TRACK

BACK UP BACK UP
'CAUSE IT'S ON NATE AND ME
THE MOMENT OF THE G

I KEEP FORGETTING WE'RE NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE
I KEEP FORGETTING THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW YOU MADE THAT SO CLEAR
I KEEP FORGETTING, BABE, EVERY TIME I HEAR

KIDS LIKE I THOUGHT
THEY WERE IN THE SAME SPOT
IN NEED OF SOME DESPERATE HELP
BUT NATE DOGG AND THE G. CHILD
WERE IN NEED OF SOMETHING ELSE (I KEEP)

ONE OF THEM DAMES
WAS SEXY AS HELL
I SAID "OOH, I LIKE YOUR SONG"
AND SHE SAID "MY CAR'S BROKE DOWN,
AND YOU SEEM REAL NICE
WOULD YOU LET ME RIDE?"

I GOT A CAR FULL OF GIRLS
AND IT'S GOING REAL SWELL
THE NEXT STOP IS
THE EAST SIDE MOTEL

I KEEP FORGETTING WE'RE NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE
I KEEP FORGETTING THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW YOU MADE THAT SO CLEAR (I KEEP)
I KEEP FORGETTING NOW

I'M TWINKING INTO A WHOLE NEW ERA
G. FUNKS STEP TO THIS IDEA
FUNK ON A WHOLE NEW LEVEL
THE RHYTHM IS THE BASS
AND THE BASS IS THE TREBLE

COOL (I KEEP)
STRINGS (FORGETTIN')
WE BRING (FORGETTIN')
MELODY  (I KEEP)

G. FUNK WHERE RHYTHM IS LIFE
AND LIFE IS RHYTHM

I KEEP FORGETTING WE'RE NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE
I KEEP FORGETTING THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
I KEEP FORGETTING HOW YOU MADE THAT SO CLEAR
I KEEP FORGETTING
