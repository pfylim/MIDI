For you
There might be a brighter star
But through my eyes the light  of you is all I see

For you
There might be another star
But all my heart can hear is your melody

Chorus:
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not thought understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two

For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But with each sparkle know the best for you
I pray

For you
Love might be four you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

Chorus: ...

For you
There might be a brighter star
But through my eyes the light  of you is all I see

For you
There might be another star
But in my heart your melody will stay
