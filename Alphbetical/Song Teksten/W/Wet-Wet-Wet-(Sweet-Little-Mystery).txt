WET WET WET - SWEET LITTLE MYSTERY

(Words & music: ...)

My love has taken a tumble
Oh, but I'm standing still
You're such a natural, sing
That's what you are

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong

It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try

Didn't I come to give you a sense of wonder
Didn't I come to give you this fiery vision
Didn't I come to give you a sense of wonder
To your life

Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby
I wouldn't steer you wrong

It's just that sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
It makes me try, sweet little mystery
That makes me try, try, try, try
Sweet little mystery that makes me try
Try, try, try, try, try

Oh just think of the magic ooh ooh
Don't think it is tragic hey hey hey
Just think of the magic

Come on listen

My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
My love has taken a tumble
But I'm still standing

Sweet little mystery that makes me try
Sweet little mystery that makes me try, try, try
Come on listen
Try try try try try try try try try
Try try try try try try try try try
