Title  : Cry For Freedom
Singer : White Lion

The fire is burning
We lay our weapons down to rest
This war ain't over
'Til all the people will be free
Straight from our hearts we cry
This has stolen too many lives
'Cause for the sake of freedom we will die
Our sons will carry on

Oh Lord we try, we try
To keep our dream alive
And voices will be heard
All around the world

Chorus:
So stand up and cry for freedom
And keep the dream alive
Yeah, stand up and cry for freedom
And keep the dream alive

Our brother's in prison
But no crime was ever done
I call it racism
Ashamed I face my fellow man
The children are taken away
And families destroyed
And millions have died from starvation
We can't go on this way

Oh Lord, we pray, we pray
That maybe soon someday
The world will smile again
And they shall be released

Chorus (3x) 
First 3 rules of chorus +
And let 'em know that we are here

Oh no, we can't go on this way
And we will never give up
Fighting for freedom
Yeah, and we will keep this dream alive
