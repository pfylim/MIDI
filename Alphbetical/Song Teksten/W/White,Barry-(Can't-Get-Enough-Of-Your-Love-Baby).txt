Title  : CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE BABE

I've heard people say that ...
Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
But I don't know about that
As many times as we've loved
Shared love and made love
It don't seem to me like it's enough
It's just not enough

My darling I, can't get enough of your love, babe
Girl, I don't know, I don't know why
Can't get enough of your love, babe

Oh, some things I can't get used to
No matter how I try
It's like the more you give the more I want
And baby that's no lie! oh no, babe
Tell me what can I say
What am I gonna do
How should I feel when ev'rything is you
What a kind of love is this
That you've given me
Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?
Girl, all I know is ev'ry time you're near

Girl if I could only make you see
And make you understand
Girl, your love for me is all I need
And more than I can stand, oh well babe
Tell me how can I explain
All the things I feel
You've given me so much
Girl you're so unreal
Still I keep loving you more and more each time
Girl what am I gonna do, 'cause you've blown my mind
I get the same old feelin', ev'ry time you're near

I feel a change something move
I scream your name, look what you got me doin'
Darling, I can't get enough of your love, babe
