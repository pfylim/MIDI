Every morning takes a change, 
it might not come around
so it's maybe coming later
a preacher man on my t.v.
says he's got the streets for me
and prays you write the letter
heavenly father tell me how it's gonna be
so that I can try to make it better
restless bars, you and I suppose they are
for blowing it all away
that's why I say

It takes more than love to get it on
you know it takes more than strength to carry on
it takes more than words to get it wrong
it takes more than love to get it on

Making us crazy, burnin' our bridges
taking them out one at a time
goodbyes you know don't come easy
did you wanna go, for the thrill of it all
why'd you wanna go cause you had no reason
for blowin it all away

You know it takes more than love to get it on
you know it takes more than strenght to carry on
it takes more than words to get it wrong
it takes more than love to get it on

Ships are sailing and you know your aim is true
the figureheads have broken in your mind
you paint yourself a picture, and it turns to black and white
and settle with the people one more time

You know it takes more than love to get it on
you know it takes more than strenght to carry on
it takes more than words to get it wrong
it takes more than love to get it on

She'll get caught by Big Sister Midnight
I've been only telling story
you will only tell me lies
