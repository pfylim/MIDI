Everything seemed the same tonite
and then the moon went out
in the middle of the sky
and the rain goin' up again
let it all come down, let it all come down
you wanna hear how the story goes
you wanna see how you're never told
where lies this fool's gold

Everytime that you say goodbye,
I sit and wonder why
why all this happiness,
now there's nothing goin' on
everytime that you said goodbye,
I'll sit and I'll get high
high on the happy side again

I hear the songs on the radio
but they don't turn me on
I hear the world's been shakin' up again
and the deals been done,
and the storm it has begun
you wanna hear how the story goes
you wanna see but you're never told
where lies this fools gold

Everytime that you say goodbye,
I sit and wonder why
why all this happiness,
now there's nothing goin' on
everytime that you said goodbye,
I'll sit and I'll get high
high on the happy side again

Everytime that you say goodbye,
I sit and wonder why
why all this happiness,
now there's nothing goin' on
everytime that you said goodbye,
I'll sit and I'll get high
high on the happy side again
