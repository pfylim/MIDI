  5. LAST CHRISTMAS - WHAM
  
  Last Christmas I gave you my heart
  But the very next day you gave it away
  This year to save me from tears
  I'll give it to someone special
  
  Last Christmas I gave you my heart
  But the very next day you gave it away, you gave it away
  This year to save me from tears
  I'll give it to someone special, special
  
  Once bitten and twice shy
  I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
  Tell me baby do you recognise me?
  Well it's funny, it doesn't surprise me
  
  Last Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
  With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
  Now I know what a fool I've been
  But if you kissed me now
  I know you'd fool me again
  
  Last Christmas I gave you my heart
  But the very next day you gave it away, you gave it away
  This year to save me from tears
  I'll give it to someone special, special
  
  Last Christmas I gave you my heart
  But the very next day you gave it away
  This year to save me from tears
  I'll give it to someone special, special
  
  Oh oh, oh my baby
  
  Crowded room friends with tired eyes
  I'm hiding from you and your soul revives
  My God I thought you were someone to rely on
  Me, I guess, I was a shoulder to cry on
  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
  A man undercover puts his heart in the fire, torn me apart
  Ooh ooh, now I've found the real love
  You'll never fool me again
  
  Last Christmas I gave you my heart
  But the very next day you gave it away, you gave it away
  This year to save me from tears
  I'll give it to someone special, special

  A face on a lover with a fire in his heart, gave you my...
  A man undercover puts his heart in the fire
  Maybe next year
  I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special, special
