
13. THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE - THE WALKER BROTHER

Loneliness is a cloak you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love, baby. 

Emptiness is a place you're in?
With nothing to lose but no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love.

Lonely, without you, baby
Girl, I need you 
I can't go on.

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
The tears are always clouding your eyes
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love, baby. 

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore.
