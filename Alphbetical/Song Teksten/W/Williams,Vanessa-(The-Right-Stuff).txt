VANESSA WILLIAMS - THE RIGHT STUFF

(Words & music: Salas/Jones)

I was standing at 7:15
Waiting for my baby's car
Just then out stepped the driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far

I said, I got my mind made up
I don't wanna leave here
Baby 'cause it's clear to me
That it's just too tough
To find another lover like mine with me

Refrain:
Right stuff
The right stuff baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Oh no, with mr. Right
Na na na na hey hey hey

Just friday abut a week ago
This fella called me on the phone
He said, I live in Paris, don't you want to go
I know you must be all alone

Well it'll take more than a fancy trip
Or a chauffeured limousine
'Cause I ain't never seen no one
Who can give me loving like this
The other fellas don't compare to the

Refrain: ...

He's the only one to give me that lovin'
'Cause next to him there is no other one
He's very sexy and oh so sweet
And he knocks me off my feet
Let me sing it again
Na na na na hey hey hey

Refrain: ...2x...
