WEE PAPA GIRL RAPPERS - FAITH

(Words & music: ...)

I remember the time
I tried to rhyme
Said to myself
I got to find the words
But this vocab ain't
All these words I know it don't fit
So I asked my sis to find me a teacher
Turn around, she brings a preacher, in
Then he said with the taste of the bass
All you gotta do
Is have a little bit of faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
 
T.Y. Tim
I'm really impressed
With the way you rhyme
I know that blessing worked
Word 'cos if it was another rap artist
You would've got jerked
So keep on keeping
In the up above name
So we can make it in the hall of fame
Like Elvis said we gotta win this race
All you gotta do is
Have a little bit of faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith

Zomba Productions proudly presents
Jive record artist T.Y. Tim and total S
Ted our producer Paul and Jim
And the whole Zomba crew
Kicking in to you
With a new style review

Like Elvis said we gotta win this race
All you gotta do is
Have a little bit of faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
Just have a little faith
