Harborlight
You're to me that special sign in life
When I sail you guide me back at night
Harborlight, oh harborlight

Harborlight
You have shown me what's wrong and right
I will never let you out of sight
Harborlight, oh harborlight

You have led my way back home many times before
You're the only one who knows what I am living for
Oh harborlight, I will come back
Oh harborlight, I really come back
Oh harborlight, bring me back harborlight
Hold me tight

Harborlight I really miss you
Harborlight I can't resist you
Harborlight help me to get through the night

Harborlight the nights are lonely
You're my friend my one and only
Harborlight help me to get through the night

Harborlight take my hand and make my life look bright
You have shown me the facts of life
Harborlight, oh harborlight
