Title  : LOVELY DAY

(Words & music: B. Withers/S. Scarborough)

(Hey hey hey hey yeah yeah)

When I wake up in the morning love (hey hey)
And the sunlight hurt my eyes
And something without warning love (hey hey)
Bears heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the worlds alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

Chorus:
A lovely day, lovely day lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day

Chorus: ...

(Hey hey yeah yeah)

When the times that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
And someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the worlds alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

Refrain: ...2x...

(Yeah hey hey yeah yeah yeah)

Then I look at you
And the worlds alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be

Refrain: ...3x...

(Yeah yeah)
