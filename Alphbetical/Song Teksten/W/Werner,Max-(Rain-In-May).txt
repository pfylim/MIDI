Title  : RAIN IN MAY
Artist : MAX WERNER

(Words & music: Meldon/Pilgram)

Feeling down when the autumn has come
Stormy days and the leaves keep on falling
I don't like town when the autumn has come
Clouds are grey and there's fog outside

Feeling down when the winter has come
Frozen feet and the snowflakes are falling
I don't like the town when the winter has come
Dirty street and there's cold outside
I don't care for a riding sleigh
Get your share for the rainy day

Chorus:
Rain in May
Wipes your roaries away
Take a dose, take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

Feeling down when the summer has come
Burning heat, drops of sweat keep on falling
I don't like the town when the summer has come
Dusty streets, and it's hot outside
I don't care for a sunny day
Get your share for the rain in May

Chorus: ...

Rain in May
Wipe your worrying away
Take a dose, take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May
