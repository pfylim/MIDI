  There was a girl, I used to know, 

  She was oh so beautiful, but she's not here anymore

  
  She had a college degree, smart as anyone could be, 

  had so much to live for


  But she fell in love, with the wrong kinda man

  He abused her love and treated her so bad

  There was not enough education in her world

  That could save the life of this little girl


  HOW COME,HOW LONG, IT'S NOT RIGHT, IT'S SO WRONG

  DO WE LET IT JUST GO ON, TURN OUR BACKS AND CARRY ON

  WAKE UP, FORE IT'S TOO LATE, RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T WAIT

  SHE WON'T HAVE A SECOND TRY, OPEN UP YOUR HEARTS AS WELL AS YOUR EYES

  She tried to give a cry for help, she even blamed things on herself
  But no one came to her aid
  Nothing was wrong as far as we could tell, that's what we'd like to
  tell ourselves, but no, it wasn't that way

  So she fell in love with the wrong kinda man
  And she paid with her life, for loving that man
  So we cannot ignore, we must look for the signs
  And maybe next time we might save somebody's life

  I, on occasion, met that guy; it stemmed a feeling deep inside
  Something about him wasn't right
  The way he proved himself a man,slapping his woman with his hands
  I wish that she had seen the light

  How can someone like-this, call himself a man
  Cause in reality he's far more less than that
  And we can not ignore, when ever we see the signs
  Cause any kind of abuse God knows is a crime
