Title  : MASTERBLASTER
Artist : STEVIE WONDER

(Words & music: Stevie Wonder)

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Chorus:
Didn't know you would be jammin'
Until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you
That you would be jammin'
Until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin'
Jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on time
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun

Chorus: ...

Bet you nobody ever told you
(we're in the middle of makin's of the
master blaster jammin')
That you would be jammin' until the break of dawn

We're jammin', jammin', jammin' on
You ask me am I happy
Well, as a matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving ;in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the
master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you that you etc.

Don't you stop the music oh no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the
master blaster jammin')

I bet you if someone
Approached you yesterday
To tell you that you would be
Jammin' you would not
Believe it because you never
Thought that you would be jammin'
Oh oh oh oh 
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the
master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'till the break of dawn
Oh oh oh you may as well
Believe what you are feeling
Because you feel your body jammin'
Oh oh you would be jammin'
Until the break of dawn
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the
master blaster jammin')
