WHAM! - EDGE OF HEAVEN

Yeah, yeah, la, la ...

I would lock you up, but I could not
bear to hear you screaming to be set free
I would chain you up if I'd thought
you'd swear the only one who mattered was me me me

I would strap you up but don't worry baby,
You know I wouldn't hurt you 'less you wanted me to
It's too late to stop, won't heavens
save me my daddy said the devil looks a lot like you

REFRAIN:
You take me to the Edge of Heaven
tell me that my soul's forgiven
hide your baby's eyes and we can ...

You take me to the Edge of Heaven
one last time might be forever
when the passion dies

It's just a matter of time before my
heart is looking for a home

Yeah, yeah, la, la ...

I'm like a maniac at the end of the day
I'm like a doggy barking at your door
so come and take me back to place you stay
and maybe we can do it once more

You say I'm dangerous, but don't worry baby
I get excited at the things that you do
and there's a place for us in a dirty movie
coz no-one does it better than me and you

REFRAIN: ...

Please don't tell me lies
It's just a matter of time before my
heart is looking for a home

Yeah, yeah, la, la ...

I ain't got no more worries
I'm gonna spend some time with you
Loving you takes such courage
And don't you think that I know it

REFRAIN: ...

Don't you tell me lies because believe
me baby one day you'll wake up on your own

I ain't got no more worries
I ain't got no more time for you
Loving you takes such courage
everyone's got their eyes on you
