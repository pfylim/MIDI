Once in my UnHoly Life
as I woke up dreaming
making love - to a devil with an angel's eyes.

She cast a spell all over me
that had this poor boy screamin'
was she real or fantasy ?

A transformed man - A moonless night - a mystery
oh goddess - of night...

Goddes of the night - make me worth of you
goddes of the night - rape me.....

Once - once in my UnHoly Life.

In a dream I dreamed a dream
and that dream is sleeping
deep inside - the palace of the Mystic Queen.

On her alter made of siliken lace
a crimson sacrifice is made
is this pain or ecstasy ?

A transformed man - A moonless night - a mystery
oh goddess - of night...

Goddes of the night - make me worth of you
goddes of the night - rape me.....

Once - once in my UnHoly Life.

Goddes of the night...
Goddes of the night...
