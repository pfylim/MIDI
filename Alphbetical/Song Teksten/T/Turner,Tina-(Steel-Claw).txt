A night in television wonderland
another fairytail about some rich bitch
lying by the swimming pool
it's the golden school
living's easy when you make the rules.

Last Friday was the first time
it only took about a half a minute
on the stairway
it was child's play
the odds turn out even
when you give up believing in the
cold law steel claw
try to get on board, you find the lock is on the door.
Well I say No way...
don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay.
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
but it doesn't really matter 
when you're lying in the Gutter.
It's a see saw
a long hot battle with the cold law
is what you get for messing with the steel claw.

The politicians have forgotten this place
except for a flying visit in a black Mercedes
no election time
they cross the line.
And everybody runs to watch the pantomime
if they could see what's going on around here
so many people hanging on to the edge
crying out for revolution retribution
the odds turn out even
when you give up believing in the
cold law steel claw
try to get on board, you find the lock is on the door.
Well I say No way...
don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay.
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
but it doesn't really matter 
when you're lying in the Gutter.
It's a see saw
a long hot battle with the cold law
is what you get for messing with the steel claw.

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
sometimes I do a line
makes me laugh
makes me want to take a joyride
on the high tide
sometimes I'm contemplaiting suicide
meanwhile Eddy's on the West Coast
I heard he's shacking up with some sweet senorita.
Up in Frisco you and I know
the odds turn out even
when you give up believing
cold law steel claw
try to get on board, you find the lock is on the door.
Well I say No way...
don't try to keep me out or there'll be hell to pay.
I don't know who's right or who's wrong
but it doesn't really matter 
when you're lying in the Gutter.
It's a see saw
a long hot battle with the cold law
is what you get for messing with the steel claw.
