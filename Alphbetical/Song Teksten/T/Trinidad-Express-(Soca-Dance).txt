                       Soca Dance


I want to play some other sweet sweet music
It's music for all the people, they don't believe it.
If you're feeling loneley, maybe just sad and blue.
This spicy rhythm might is the right thing for you!
All around the world a message from the islands.
Rather play the fool than suffer on in silence.

Dance, Soca Dance - Soca Dance
Dance, Soca Dance  do the Soca Dance

Want to play us some happy Soca beat
This gubbid young rhythm will put you on your feet
Whether you're young whether you're old and grey
Gather around you join it night and day

All along the beach a party in the moonlight
The Soca sounds will make the feeling of the tune right
Dance....
One two three, do you feel it - yes Dance
Dance, Soca Dance - Soca Dance

Go boy
Come on everybody. Let's have a good time
You over there come on over
Dance, Soca Dance - Soca Dance    
Do you feel it? Yes
Dance, Soca Dance - do the Soca Dance

I waned you all free up your minds, free up your souls
Let the Soca music take control
Everybody come on
