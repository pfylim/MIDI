Now when I'm down on the microphone stand
I give you all the dope lyrics and
Introducing the band to make you understand
How this is planned I demand a microphone
To rock the home boys with an instrumental
to make noise yo I rock the home girls too
I'll explain the name of the crew
--------------------------------------------------------
This beat is this beat is
this beat is Technotronics'
This beat is Technotronics'
and Eric's got lyrics(for ya)
--------------------------------------------------------
I saw ya posse but now it's me who's bosse
So I'm giving the order around here
You don't wanna get sacked so be a 
good party go-er get the floor ready
and yaself ready huh
I rock steady like a rock and I woun't stop
Till it's at the top
And the people stop to hop to it
Yo they couldn't do it
To get more to the point they blew it
But not like blowing the speaker
they can't go on because they're weaker
I seek a strong posse
I insist for this's the bosse
People prove that lethal beats
can't equal feats that I
Produce and Techno produced it
So tight right yo it can't be a loose fit
So step right up for your size
You know what the first price is Yo
--------------------------------------------------------
and Eric's got lyrics for ya
Dance floor must rush
You don't wanna make noise so hush
Ssssshhh! Listen no hissing and booing
I mean who in the world is fresher
I test a M.C. in my spare time
But right now I'm making the song
I'm on the right track
There's the dope beat this is the rap
That was a warning
I'm getting warm and now we're all in
Participation move the nation
This creation I put the bass in
I put the rhymes inside
To glide and ride so lonely
I confide in to you
