Go, there's no place for you in my heart
I don't need you
leave just a picture of you on my wall
(It's) not a memory

You say that I
can't do without you
but you're wrong this time

Give me your number to call on the phone
just in case
(But) don't you think that I want
you back in my home
oh no

It ain't my beating heart that beats for you
I guess it's just your fantasy
it ain't my beating heart that bleeds for you
it's not for you
no, not for you

It ain't my beating heart that beats for you
I guess it's just your fantasy
it ain't my beating heart that bleeds for you
it's not for you
no, not for you

You think you see the tracks of tears on my face
my baby
I guess your heart must be the 
loneliest place
in the world

You say that I 
can't do without you
but you're wrong this time

It ain't my beating heart that beats for you
I guess it's just your fantasy
it ain't my beating heart that bleeds for you
it's not for you
no, not for you

It ain't my beating heart that beats for you
I guess it's just your fantasy
it ain't my beating heart that bleeds for you
it's not for you
no, not for you
