Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : DINGE DONG

When you're feelin' alright, everything is uptight
Try to sing a song that goes ding dinge dong
There will be no sorrow, when you sing tomorrow
And you walk along with your ding dinge dong

Refrain:
Dinge dong every hour, when you pick a flower
Even when your lover is gone gone gone
Dinge dong listen to it, maybe it's a big hit
Even when your lover is gone gone gone
Sing ding dang dong

When you're feelin' alright, everything is uptight
Try to sing a song that goes ding dinge dong
And the world looks sunny, everyone is funny
When they sing a song that goes ding dang dong

Refrain: ...

(ding dang dong, dinge dang dong)

When you think it's all over
They let me down
Dry your tears and forget all your sorrow
Try to smile when you say goodbye
Ding dang dong
When you wake up tomorrow,
When the sun is up in the sky
