Title  : BABY GET IT ON

You don't know girl how you blow my mind
I said now, baby won't you hear what I say
I want your lovin' in the worst darn way so come on
Baby let's get it on
Well, you're the finest girl I ever found in my life
I wanna stick to you like white on white
So come on, baby let's get it on
Now I said now
Baby baby baby get it on
You know that I've been waiting too dog gone long
So come on, baby let's get it on

Now you don't want me enough for me to turn me on
Come on baby what you waitin' on
Come on baby baby baby get it on
Now you're the finest girl just as fine as can be
I want every joy for you and me
So come on baby let's get it on
Now I said now
