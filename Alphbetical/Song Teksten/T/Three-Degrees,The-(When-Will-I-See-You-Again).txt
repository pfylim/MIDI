Singer : THE THREE DEGREES 
Title  : WHEN WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN

When will I see you again
When will we share precious moments
Will I have to wait for ever
Will I have to suffer
And cry the whole night through

When will I see you again
When will our hearts be together
Are we in love or just friends
Is this my beginning or is this the end
When will I see you again

Precious moments
Are we in love or just friends

Is this my beginning or is this the end
When will I see you again
