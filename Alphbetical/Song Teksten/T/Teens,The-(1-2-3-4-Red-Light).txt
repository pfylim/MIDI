Can't you hear my heartbeat baby, even here at school
maybe it is love or maybe I'm a fool
two more hours to go and then it's time for fun
baby if you wanna love will carry on.

I want you, I need you, I love you tonight
I pick you up at seven by the traffic light.

One two three four red light
school is now over and I'll see you tonight
five six seven eight come on and dance
day is for school, but tonight's for romance.

Don't care about the others, even when they say
I'm not a one day lover, come let's go our way
it's hard to be in love, when you are just fifteen
but you're the sweetest girl I've ever seen.

I want you, I need you, I love you tonight
I pick you up at seven by the traffic light.

One two three four red light
school is now over and I'll see you tonight
five six seven eight come on and dance
day is for school, but tonight's for romance.
