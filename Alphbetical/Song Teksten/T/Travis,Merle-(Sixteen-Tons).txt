Some people say a man is made out of mud.
A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
muscle and blood and skin and bones.
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong,

you load sixteen tons, what do you get ?
Another day older and deeper in debt.
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store.

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the  mine,
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
and the strawboss said "well a bless my soul."

You load sixteen tons, what do you get ?
Another day older and deeper in debt.
Saint Peter, don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store.
