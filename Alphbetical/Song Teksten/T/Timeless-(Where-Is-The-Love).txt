12. WHERE IS LOVE - TIMELESS

Hey baby, baby...

Where is the love we used to know
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
We had a love to last all time
Nobody's love is stronger than mine
Where is the love we used to know
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?

What am I gonna to do
To stop these tears from falling?
I lie awake at night
And I can hear you calling
What am I gonna say 
When our friends ask about you?
I guess I'll just pretend
I'm better without you.

I look in the mirror
And I see you're a broken man
It's such a sorry sight to see, oh baby
Now we're not together 
Who's gonna make my plans?
It don't make any difference to me.

Oh baby
Where is the love we used to know
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
We had a love to last all time
Nobody's love is stronger than mine
Where is the love we used to know
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?

How can I find my way?
Without your love to guide me
I stop and close my eyes
And I feel you deep inside me
How can I face the world?
When there's no way to find you
You took your love away
And closed the door behind you.

What good is tomorrow
If nothing's right today?
I can't stop holding on to you
Oh baby
All I've got are my memories
Yeah, brings back yesterday
When all that I believed in was true.

Oh baby
Where is the love we used to know?
(Where is the love?)
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
(How did we lose it?)
We had a love to last all time (oh, oh baby)
Nobody's love is stronger than mine (oh)
Where is the love we used to know
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
How did we lose it?

Hi, I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number
I'll get back to you.

Oh girl
Please pick up the phone
I've been trying to reach you all day
You know I've got a lot of things to say to you
I want you to listen to me
Please listen to me
I need you.

What good is tomorrow
If nothing's right today?
I can't stop holding on to you
Oh baby
All I've got are my memories
Yeah, brings back yesterday
When all that I believed in was true
When all that I believed in was true.

Where is the love we used to know?
(Where is the love? Where is the love?)
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
(Where did it go now baby?)
We had a love to last all time (ooh)
Nobody's love is stronger than mine
(It's getting stronger, baby)
Where is the love we used to know?
(I need to know, I need to know)
Where did it go?
How did we lose it? (ooh)

Where is the love we used to know?
(Tell me, tell me, tell me)
How did we lose it?
Where did it go?
(Where did it go?)...
