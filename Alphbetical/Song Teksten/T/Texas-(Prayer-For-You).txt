Title  : Prayer For You
Singer : Texas


All I see is the truth now
That's all I want you to know
That I'll never turn my back on you
And leave you out there on your own
I could never hide my feelings
I could never let you fall
And I want you to remember
All the love that I've found

Chorus:
Oh I say a prayer
A prayer for you, oh for you

I could never make a promise
I'd only break it in the end
The you're looking for the answers
You'd never trust in me again
I could never watch you suffer
I could never let you down
And I hope you soon discover
All the truth that I've now found

Chorus (2x)


Words & Music : McElhone, Spiteri
