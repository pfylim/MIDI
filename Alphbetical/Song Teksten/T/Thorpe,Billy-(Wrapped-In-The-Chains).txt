You're an expert at love
and making it last
not too little too late
or too much too fast
oh oh I'm a prisoner in the chains of your love.

You make it so hard
you tease me to death
with your two fisted love
I'm a trembling mess
oh oh I'm a prisoner in the chains of your love.

Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.
Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.

Long  nights of love
with a long legged queen
is a first class romance
in a gold plated dream
oh oh I'm a prisoner in the chains of your love.

Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.
Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.

With your teasing I'm hardly breathing
bound by the love of you...
ooh take me you can make me
anything at all you know it's really up to you.

Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.
Oh oh oh wrapped in the chains of your love.
