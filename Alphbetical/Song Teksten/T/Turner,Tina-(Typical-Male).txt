TINA TURNER - TYPICAL MALE

Tell me lawyer what to do
I think I'm fallin' in love with you
Defend me, from the way I feel
Won't you give me some advice
On how to handle my private life
I'm sure that we can make a deal

I confess I'm a fool for a man
With a clever mind
But your intellect ain't no match
For this heart of mine

Refrain:
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

Your sense of justice I'll embrace
But your defence don't help my case
I'm deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer, gotta catch me when I fall

Refrain: ...

So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
Open up your heart and let me in
Open up your heart and let me in
