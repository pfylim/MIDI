The world is full of married men
with wives who never understand.
They're looking for someone to share
the excitement of a love affair.
And just as soon as they find you
they wine you and dine you
fly on the wings of romance
but in the eyes of the world
you're just another girl who loves a married man.

Ooh - they do it, they do it, they do it,
they do it again and again
they do it, they do it, they do it
they do it these married men.

Oh you make him feel so young
but his wife is still the number one.
He promises to marry you - yeah
just as soon as his divorce comes through
and it's not just a fling
he swears it's the real thing.
A love that will last till the end
but as he's driving away
you'll know it's true what they say about married men.

They say - they do it, they do it, they do it,
they do it again and again,...

Run when the scandal gets too hot to handle.
He'll say he just wants to be friends
and then he'll walk out of your life
and go home to his wife
'cause he's a married man.
Ooh - your love is a secret
and you've got to stick it as long as you can
and don't cry for your lover
there's always another married man, married man.

They do it, they do it, they do it
they do it married, married men.
Ooh - they do it, they do it, they do it
they do it these married men
the world is full of them
girls now listen...
