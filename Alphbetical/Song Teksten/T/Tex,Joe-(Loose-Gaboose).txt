Title  : LOOSE CABOOSE

(Words & music: Joe Tex/Gloria Thompson)

Hey Chubby Checker, hey Hank Ballard
Hey Rufus Thomas, hey Joey Dee
I remember when y'all had the whole world dancin'
Now come on and do this little dance with me

It's called the loose caboose
Shake it and turn it loose

The loose caboose
Shake it and turn it a loose (3x)

Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes y'all
Here the porky comes
Porky gonna show you how it's done
And you learn how to do it
You'll have a whole lot of fun
'Cause the way she twists that thing and moves it around
A chicken eatin' preacher'll lay his drum stick down
Ain't that the truth, y'all

Drink your juice and do the loose caboose
You better come on, you better come on
