Wake up, get outta bed
said the voice in their head
today is the day you're leaving.

Somehow that same voice from the sky
on that magical night
touched their soul and their reason.

Now they're flying so high up through the sky
all the earthlings have gone to the sun children's song
mother earth far behind
father sun is the guide
all the earthlings have gone to the sun children's song
sun children's song
sun children's song
sun children's song.
