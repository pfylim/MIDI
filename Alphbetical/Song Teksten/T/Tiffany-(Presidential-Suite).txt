Title  : PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

(Words & music: Rob Bolland/Ferdie Bolland)

Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
A senator, a president, a congressman or so
It's a V.I.P. everybody knows
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
Nobody knows about this secret love affair
My love ambassador has a diplomatic flair

I'll vote for your love
I'll vote for your love
I'll vote for your love

Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
A senator, a president, a congressman or so
It's a V.I.P. everybody knows
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
Guess who I'm gonna meet in my presidential suite
All he really wants is a White House career
But when we're all alone, he's much a lovely dear

I'll vote for your love
I'll vote for your love
I'll vote for your love
