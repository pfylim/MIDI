You must understand
that the touch of your hand
makes my pulse react
that it's only the thrill
of boy meeting girl
opposites attract
it's physical
only logical
you must try to ignore
that it means more than that.

Oh what's love got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do with it
who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken.

It may seem to you
that I'm acting confused
when you're close to me
if i tend to look dazed
I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be.

There's a name for it
there's a phrase for it
but whatever the reason
you do it for me

Oh what's love got to do with it
what's love but a second hand emotion
what's love got to do with it
who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken.

I've been thinking of a new direction
but I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
it scares me to feel this way
what's love got to do with it
what's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
what's love got to do with it
who need's a heart when a heart can be broken.
