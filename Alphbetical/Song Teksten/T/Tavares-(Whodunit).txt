(Words & music: Keni St. Lewis/Freddie Perren)

Refrain:
Whodunit?
Who stole my baby
Whodunit?
Every one in the room looks shady
Whodunit?
Who stole my girl from me
Whodunit?
Who took my honey
Whodunit?
I know the motive was not funny
Whodunit?
It's a bed side mystery

Where's the phone, call Sherlock Holmes
Somebody took my baby
I've been framed by what's his name
And he's getting away
Charlie Chan see if you can
Help me find those two
Oh, won't you

Where were you on the night of the twelfth
I was by myself
She went dancing in the dark
Somebody stole her heart
Ellery Queen if you're so keen
Won't you help me find my sweet things
Yeah yeah

Refrain: ...

The place is surrounded
Nobody leaves till I found her
Until this case is solved
It's up against the wall
You all

Refrain: ...
