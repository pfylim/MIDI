
1. GOLDEN EYE - TINA TURNER

See reflections on the water
More than darkness in the depths
See him surface and never a shadow
On the wind I feel his breath

Golden eye, I found his weakness
Golden eye, you do what I please
Golden eye, no time for sweetness
But a bitter kiss will bring him to his knees

You`ll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You`ll never know
How it feels to be the one who`s left behind

You`ll never know the days and nights
The tears, the tears I`ve cried
But now my time has come
And time, time is not on your side

See him move through smoke and mirrors
Feel his presence in the crowd
Other girls, they gather around him
If I had him I wouldn`t let him out

Golden eye, might lace or leather
Golden chain take him to the spot
Golden eye, I show him forever
It`ll take forever to see what I`ve got

You`ll never know
How I watched you from the shadows as a child
You`ll never know
How it feels to get so close and be denied

It`s a gold and honey trap
I`ve got for you tonight
Revenge is the kiss this time I won`t miss
Now I`ve got you in my sight
With a golden eye
Golden, golden eye
With a golden eye
Golden eye
