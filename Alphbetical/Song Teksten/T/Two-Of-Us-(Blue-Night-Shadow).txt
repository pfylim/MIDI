BLUE NIGHT SHADOW - TWO OF US


   Here she comes on the run
   she's so young she's so fine

   here to tease not to please
   she'll say no every time
   she's only gonna break your heart
   only gonna break your heart
   only gonna play gonna tear your heart apart

   Refrain:
   she's a blue night shadow a blue night shadow
   blue night shadow on the run
   she's a blue night shadow a blue night shadow
   what you gonna do

    feel the heat in the street
   shadows dance on the wall
   her suspence so intense
   getting through your defence
   she's only gonna break your heart
   only gonna break your heart
   only gonna play gonna tear your heart apart

Refrain...
