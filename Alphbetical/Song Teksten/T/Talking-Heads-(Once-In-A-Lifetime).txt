Title  : ONCE IN A LIFETIME
Artist : TALKING HEADS

(Words & music: David Byrne/B. Eno)

And you may find yourself living in a shot gun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house with a 
beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, well, how did I get here

Chorus:
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, flowing water underground
To the blue again after the money's gone, 
Once in a life time, water flowing under ground

And you may ask yourself how do I work this
And you may ask yourself where is that large automobile?
And you may tell yourself this is not my beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself this is not my beautiful wife

Chorus: ...

Water dissolving, and water demoving
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Carry the water at the bottom of the ocean
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean

And you may ask yourself, what is that beautiful house
And you may ask yourself, where does the highway go to?
And you may ask yourself, am I right? am I wrong?
And you may ask yourself, my God, what have I done

Chorus: ...

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
