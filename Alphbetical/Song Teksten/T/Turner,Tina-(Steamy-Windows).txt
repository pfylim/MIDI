Title  : Steamy Windows
Singer : Tina Turner


I was thinking about parking last night
We was out on a back road
Me and my woman was just getting right
Our systems on overload
The radio blasting in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
We was snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the bodyheat

You can wine and dine a woman all night
With good intentions
But there's something
About competition on a back road
Breaks down the defenses

Steamy windows
Ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Coming from the bodyheat

There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes her snuggle up
Just a little bit closer
And it starts things happening again

Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Coming from the bodyheat
Steamy windows
