TINA TURNER - ONE OF THE LIVING

In this desert sun
Ev'ry step that you take could be the final one
And in the burning heat hanging on the edge of destruction
No you can't stop the pain of your children
Crying out in your head
Oh they always said that the living would envy the dead

So now you're gonna shoot shoot bullets of fire
Don't want to fight but sometimes you got to
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you got to know
You got ten thousand miles to go because you're...

Refrain:
One of the living
'n' if you can't stick together
Well you're one of the living
Who's gonna make it tonight

Oh walk talk, cool, collected but savage
Mm- walk tall, bruised sensual ravaged
Mm- it's ev'ry man for himself ev'ry woman ev'ry child
A new breed ferocious and wild

'n' all they want to do is shoot bullets of fire
They want to fight and sometimes you got it
You're some soul survivor
And there's just one thing you got to know
You got ten thousand miles to go because you're...

Refrain: ...
