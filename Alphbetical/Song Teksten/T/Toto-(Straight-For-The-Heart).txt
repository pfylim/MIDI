     VSP
     
     Boy meets girl on the playground of life
     Falls in love for the very first time
     Day and night he sees her alone
     She's the type that can never be owned
     
     HE CAN'T GET HER OFF HIS MIND
     But she knows HE'LL GET OVER HER IN TIME
     And the world goes round
     
     SHE GOES STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART
     She serves it sweet and cold (OEOEOEOE)
     WELL SHE GOES STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART
     Cause that's the only thing that she's ever known
     
     
     Boy sees girl on the poor side of town
     A city princess with her very own crown
     He's too young to be taking such a chance
     She walks the streets in the name of romance
     
     EVERYWHERE SHE GOES HE'S THERE
     And she knows HE'S JUST ANOTHER FOOL WHO CARES
     And the world goes round (AND ROUND)
     
     SHE GOES STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART
     She serves it sweet and cold (OEOEOE)
     WELL SHE GOES STRAIGHT FOR THE HEART
     Cause that's the only thing that she's ever known
