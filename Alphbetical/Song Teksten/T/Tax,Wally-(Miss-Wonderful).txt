Title  : MISS WONDERFUL

Oh miss Wonderful
You're so beautiful
You're so fine
How I wish that you were mine

Oh miss Awful-nice
You are paradise
Are you real?
Don't you know the way I feel?

There's something new about this love
I wanna give to you
There's something clean and beautiful
And darling I'll be true, to you

'Cause you're beautiful
'Cause you're beautiful
'Cause you're fine
I'm gonna make you mine

Yeah, I'll make you mine
All I need is time
Time is on my side
Forget your foolish pride
