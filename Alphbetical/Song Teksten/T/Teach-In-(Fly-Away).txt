Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : FLY AWAY

If you're lonely
You're just down and out
Feelin' lonely
And you feel that
You've just gotta shout
Feelin' lonely

Open your window
Unlock your door
Let in some sunshine
Lift your feet of the floor
The floor

Fly away fly away fly away
Get your feet of the clay
Fly away fly away fly away
Get your feet of the clay
Face another day

If your loved one
Leaves you all alone
Feelin' lonely
Don't you let it
Make you weep and moan
Feelin' lonely

Open your window
Unlock your door
Let in some sunshine
Lift your feet of the floor
The floor

And fly away fly away fly away
Get your feet of the clay
Fly away fly away fly away
Get your feet of the clay
Face another day
