Title  : SARAH SMILES

(Words & music: Bram Tchaikovsky)

Sarah smiles
Takes my breath away
Sarah smiles
Nothing I can say
Oh, it hurts
With a pain down to the bone
Yes, it hurts
Every time you're
Every time you're gone

Chorus:
So goodnight, my love, goodnight
I'll see you when the morning light
Comes sweeping through my window pane
In frosty white
So goodnight, my love goodnight
I'll see you when the morning light
Comes sweeping through my window pane
In frosty white
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Sarah smiles
As I brush her cheek
Sarah smiles
Softly, she's a softly, she's asleep
I must leave
Before the daylight breaks
I must leave
Before she wakes to find me gone
And her alone again

Chorus: ...2x...
