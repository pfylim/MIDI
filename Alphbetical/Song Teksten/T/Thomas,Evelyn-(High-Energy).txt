EVELYN THOMAS - HIGH ENERGY

Refrain:
High energy
Your love is lifting me
High energy
Your love is lifting me
Lifting me high

It was only last week that we first met
When I was walking down the street
You came up from behind me and I knew
That our eyes were gonna meet
That's when I fell into your arms
Imagine my surprise
I thought this only happened in fairy tales
Love hit me right between the eyes oh yeah

Refrain: ...

When you call me on the phone
You make my spirits rise
I'm glad the others didn't last
It's a blessing in disguise
Every time you're touching me
It gives me such a thrill
When I look deep into your eyes
My heart just can't keep still oh no

Refrain: ...

(Ooh so high)

All the gold that's in Fort Knox
Couldn't buy this happiness
With your love I don't need money
I don't need success
I become a victim of
A sudden love attack yeah
It happened in-a the blink of an eye
And there's no holding back

Refrain: ...
