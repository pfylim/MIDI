Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : IN THIS SUMMERNIGHT

Refrain:
In this summernight love is all around
In this dreamy light love is to be found
Leave your words and make it true
Gonna fall in love with you
When I write this in remembering
The days I spend with you
I feel lonely when I think
About the nights and what to do

Staying lonely isn't my way
So I'm gonna catch the bus
To be reaching you this evening
There'll be just the two of us

Refrain: ...

When I write this in remembering
A holiday with you
But it's winter and you're far away
I don't know what to do
When the days are getting stronger
And the summer's getting real
I'll be reaching you every evening
And I'll show you how I feel

Wish that I could take you far away
To the sun, the moon, the stars one day
To a never ending love
Because we'll never get enough
