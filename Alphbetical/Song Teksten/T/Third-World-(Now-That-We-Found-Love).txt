Singer : THIRD WORLD 
Title  : NOW THAT WE FOUND LOVE

(Words & music: Gamble/Huff)

Chorus:
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it?

Make natty shook (4x)
Make natty shook, shook, shook, shook all over the place
I say, come on baby, when the music's playing
I wanna see you dance, dance, dance
Come on baby, I said when the music's playing
I wanna see you dancing
Get up and dance
Move your arms, move your legs
I said, come on baby let me tell you what I'll make you do
I said, music is the soul into my soul
And moving on and on

Chorus: ...

Let's give love a try, let's have control
Control your destiny
Sweet life is what we've been searching for
And love is what we're looking for
Now that I've got it right here in my hand
I'm gonna spread it all over the land

Going to ourselves, yes, we do to live happy eternally
Sweet life is what we've been searching for
And love is what we're looking for
Now that I've got it right here in my hand
I'm gonna spread it all over the land

You got to forgive and forget
Let fate be your enemy
Love, love and only love will set your spirit free

Chorus: ...
