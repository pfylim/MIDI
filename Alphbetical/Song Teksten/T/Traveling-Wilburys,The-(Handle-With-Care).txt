THE TRAVELING WILBURYS - HANDLE WITH CARE

Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up and I've been shot down
You're the best thing I've ever found
Handle me with care

Reputations changeable
situations tolerable
Baby you're adorable
handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that
you really care

Everybody's got somebody
to lean on
Put your body next to mine
and dream on

I've been fobbed off and
I've been fooled
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In day care centers and night schools
Handle me with care

Been stuck in airports
terrorized
Sent to meetings
hypnotized
overexposed
commercialized
Handle me with care

I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care

Everybody's got somebody
to lean on 
Put your body next to mine
and dream on

I've been uptight and made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care
