Even now there's still why
but the answer will never come
did you leave us with lies
or was there nothing left to live for

The thought remains
all the lights are out in sleeping town
the dream lives on

And you know some sails will never sail

Always swimming against the stream
never running with the tide
you were struck by all beauty
as well as ugliness inside

The thought remains
and there's light in all the dark
the dream lives on

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails

Even now there's still why
but the answer will never come
did you leave us with lies
or was there nothing left to live for

The thought remains
and there's light in all the dark
the dream lives on

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails

Some sails don't cross the river
Some sails never sails
re the reason , the blue in my sky.
Josephine I'll send you all my love, Josephine.
