TANITA TIKARAM - TWIST IN MY SOBRIETY

(Words & music: Tanita Tikaram)

All God's children need travelling shoes
Drive your problems from here
All good people read good books
Now you conscience is clear
I hear you talking
Now your conscience is clear

In the morning when I wipe my brow
Wipe the miles away
I like to think I can be so willed
And never do what you say I'll never hear you
And never do what you say

Refrain:
Look my eyes are just holograms
Look your love has drawn red from my hands
From my hands you know you'll never be
More the twist in my sobriety
More than twist in my sobriety

We just poked a little empty pie
For fun the people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
Timid smile and pause to free
I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll

Refrain: ...

Cup of tea take
Time of think yeah
Time to risk a life a life a life
Sweet and handsome soft and porky
You pig out till you've seen the light
Pig out till you've seen the light

Refrain: ...
