What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words

Words in papers
Words in books
Words on tv
Words, words, words
Words of comfort
Words of peace
Words to make the fighting cease
Words to tell you what to do
Words are working hard for you
Eat your words
But don't go hungry
Words have always nearly hung me

Chorus:
Ron son son-a-ron son son
Puddy puddy puddy puddy on son son
Akai yay yaup akai yay youp
Oh a, oh a lee kee chee

What are words for?
What are words for?
Words

Words of nuance
Words of skill
And words of romance are a thrill
Words are stupid
Words are fun
Words can put you on the run
Mots presses
Mots senses
Mots qui disent la veritie
Mots, mots dit
Mots mentis
Mots quit manquent le frit d'esprit

Chorus: ...

What are words worth?
What are words worth?
Words
