Pushing time and space aside
across the universe together
thru tomorrow - to forever
the ships fly on and on.

Down in the corridors of light
to their final destination
to the center of creation and the children of the sun.

Not one soul has stayed behind
just the traces of mankind
nothing that really matters
in one earth day they had gone
to leave the earth to mand alone
that's all that really matters now.

### Instrumental ###

Down in the corridors of light
to their final destination
to the center of creation and the children of the sun.

Not one soul has stayed behind
just the traces of mankind
nothing that really matters
not one sould has stayed behind
just the traces of mankind
nothing that really matters.

No more gravity nothing holding them down.
No more gravity nothing holding them down.
