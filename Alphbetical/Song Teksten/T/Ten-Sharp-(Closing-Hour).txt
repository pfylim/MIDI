And now the moon is down
nothing really matters
the bottle's done by now
and nothing ever happens

Melody is fadin'
they're closin' down
it's closin' hour again
closin' hour again

The day is done by now
I heard so many stories
I should write them down
the song is sung by now

Melody is fadin'
and the rhythm keeps on playin'
the time has come
it's closin' hour
it's closin' hour again

The bottle is down by now
it gives a certain fascination
and when the woman smiles
she sends a silent invitation

Melody is fadin'
and the airco keeps on swayin'
the time has come
it's closin' hour
it's closin' hour again

People seem to need some action
people come to life
people seem to need some action
people come to life

The day is done by now
I heard so many stories
I should write them down
the song is sung by now

Melody is fadin'
and the rhythm keeps on playin'
the time has come
it's closin' hour
it's closin' hour again
it's closin' hour
it's closin' hour again
it's closin' hour again
