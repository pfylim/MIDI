Singer : WALLY TAX 
Title  : IT AIN'T NO USE

It ain't no use
All I got is the blues
Walk a mile in my shoes
To see what I mean

It ain't no use
I'm -a- telling the truth
I don't know what to do
Baby since I met you

Refrain:
It's not my fault
And there's no one I can blame
But the things I do
Kinda make me feel ashamed
It's not my fault
You're not falling for me
Baby please set me free
Or fall in love with me

It ain't no use
To go on like this
There's so much I miss
Baby when I see you
It ain't no use
Walking 'round in a cloud
Day in and day out
Oh...how you knocked me about

Refrain: ...
