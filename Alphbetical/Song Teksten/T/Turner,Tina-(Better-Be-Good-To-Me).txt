Titel:             BETTER BE GOOD TO ME

Interpret/Text:    TINA TURNER

---------------------------------------------------------------------


A prisoner of your love
entangled in your web
hot whispers in the night
I'm captured by your spell captured
oh yes I'm touched by this show of emotion
should I be fractured by your lack of devotion
should I, should I.

Oh you better be good to me
that's how its got to be now
cause I don't have no use
for what you loosely call the truth
oh, you better be good to me
yes you better be good to me.

And I think it's only right
that we don't meet at night
we stand face to face
and you present your case
and I know you keep telling me
that you love me
and I reall do want to believe
but did you think I'd just accept you in blind faith
oh, sure baby anything to please you
oh, you better be good to me.

That's how it's got to be now
cause I don't have tha time for your over loaded lines
yes, you better be good to me
yes, you better be good to me
and I really don't see
why it's so hard to be
good to me
and I don't understand
what's your plan
that you can't be good to me
what I can't feel
I surely cannot see 
why can't you
be good to me
if it is not real
I do not wish to see
why can't you
be good to me
why can't you
be good to me.
