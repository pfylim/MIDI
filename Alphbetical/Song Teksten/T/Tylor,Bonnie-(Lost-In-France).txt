3.  LOST IN FRANCE - BONNIE TYLOR

I was lost in France,
In the fields that heard you singing.
I was lost in France 
And the day was just beginning.
I just stood there in the morning rain,
I had a feeling, I can't explain.
I was lost in France in love.

I was lost in France,
In the street a band was playing.
And the crowd of players,
Couldn't catch what they were saying.
When I looked up, he was standing there
And I know I shouldn't, but I didn't care.
I was lost in France in love.

Chorus
Hula-la-la Hula-la-la dance.
Hula-la-la dancing.
Hula-la-la Hula-la-la dance.
Hula-la-la dancing.
Hula-la-la Hula-la-la dance.
Hula-la-la dancing.

I was lost in France,
And the wines were overflowing.
I was lost in France
And a million stars were blowing.
And I looked around for a telephone
And you say, baby, I won't be home.
I was lost in France in love.

Chorus

And I looked around for a telephone
And you say, baby, I won't be home.
I was lost in France in love.

Chorus repeat
