  10. ROSANNA - Toto
  
  All I want to do 
  When I wake up in the morning
  Is see your eyes
  Rosanna Rosanna
  Never thought that a girl like you
  Could ever care for me
  Rosanna.
  
  All I want to do 
  In the middle of the evening
  Is hold you tight
  Rosanna Rosanna
  I didn't know you were looking
  For more than I could ever be.
  
  I'm pining here since you went away
  Rosanna, yeah
  Now she's gone and I have to say;
  
  Meet you all the way

  I can see your face still
  Shining through the window
  On the other side
  Rosanna Rosanna
  I didn't know that a girl like you
  Could make me feel so sad
  Rosanna.
  
  All I wanna take is not that
  I never never have to compromise
  Rosanna Rosanna
  I never thought that losing you
  Could ever hurt so bad.
