Title  : SEE THE SUN

(Words & music: K. Versteeg)

Chorus:
See the sun (see, see the sun)
See the sunshine (see the sun go down)
See the sun (see, see the sun)
See the sunshine (see the sun go down)

As I was younger than today
I like to dream the clouds away
So I went lonesome down the bay
And lived to see the sun go down

I did expect a lonely night
As you came walking by my side
And with the man of my delight
I lived to see the sun go down

Ev'ry morning when I wake up
You're out there, where ever the fleet will go
I pray for giving him back to me
Ev'ry day when things are wrong
I won't be grieving, I will be strong (oho)
I pray for giving him back to me

But there's the day
You are furling down the quay
And you're giving me your hand
It's the end of a nightmare

Chorus: ...

That evening we, you will agree
Enjoyed your coming back to me
And as we walked along the sea
We lived to see the sun go down

Today a man came to my door
He said, you won't be back no more
With tears I'm walking along the shore
We'll never see the sun no more
