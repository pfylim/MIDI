
               You             Ten Sharp


It`s allright for me as long as you are by my side.
Talk or just say nothing, I don`t mind, your looks never lie.
I was always on the run,
findin` out what I was looking for and I,
I was always insecure, oh, just until I found.

Words often don`t come easy,
I`ll never learn to show the inside of me, oh, no, my baby,
and you were always patient,
and draggin` out what I`m trying to hide.

Bridge 

I was always on the run, findin` out,
what iI was looking for and I was always insecure,
until I found, oh, oh.

Refrain 

You, you were always on my mind,
you, you`re the one I`m livin` for.
you, you`re my everlasting bind,
oh, oh, oh, you`re an always shining star, ah, ah.


The night, always a good friend,
a glass of wine and the lights stand low.
And you lying beside me, and we fall in love,
and I`m filled with hope.

Refrain  2x 

You, You...
