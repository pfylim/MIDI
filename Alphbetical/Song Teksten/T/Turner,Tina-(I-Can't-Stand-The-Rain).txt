I can't stand the rain
against my window,
bringing back sweet memories.

I can't stand the rain
against my window,
because he's not here with me.

Hey window pain
do you remember
how sweet it used to be
when we were together,
everything was so grand
now that we've parted
there's one sound that I just can't stand.

I can't stand the rain
against my window,
bringing back sweet memories.
I can't stand the rain
