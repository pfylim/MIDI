Singer : TOTO 
Title  : HOLD THE LINE

(Words & music: David Paich)

It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treatin' my friends
It's not in the way that you stay'd till the end
It's not in the way that you look 
Or the things that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way that you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love sets me free
It's not in the way that you look 
Or do the things that you do say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
