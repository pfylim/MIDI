Singer : THE THREE DEGREES 
Title  : DIRTY OL' MAN

Refrain:
You're a dirty ol' man
You can't keep your hands to yourself
You're a dirty ol' man
You mess around with somebody else

Yet I done told you
You may look but please don't touch
'Cause you don't understand a word I mean
Can't you see I'm not old enough
You say that ain't nothing but a number
You're much too experienced for me
All you wanna do is take my love
All you wan' is a total victory

Refrain: ...

Next time you see me
You can speak but please don't start
'Cause I believe ev'ry word you said
And here I am with a broken heart
The window came down
Don't waist it on me
You're a married man and I feel free
All you wanna do is take my love
All you wan' is a total victory

Refrain: ...

Dirty, dirty, dirty
