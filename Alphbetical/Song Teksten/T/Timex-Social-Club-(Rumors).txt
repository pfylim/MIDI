TIMEX SOCIAL CLUB - RUMORS

(Words & music: M. Thompson/M. Marshall/A. Hill)

How do rumors get started
They're started by the jealous people
And they get mad seeing something they had
And somebody else is holding

They tell me that temptation
Is very hard to resist
These wicked women
Ooh they just persist

Now maybe you think it's cute
But girl I'm not impressed
I tell you one time only
With my business please don't mess

Refrain:
When you look at all these rumors
Surrounding every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from
From all these rumors
I can't take it no more
My best friend says 
That's why I'll never meet the girl next door

Did you hear that one about Michael
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue but they said
If he was straight he wouldn't move that way

Did you hear about Susan
Some say she's just a tease
In a camisole she's six feet tall
She'll knock you to your knees

Refrain: ...

I can't go no place
Without somebody pointing a finger
I can't show my face
'Cause when it comes to rumors
I'm a dead ringer
It seems from rumors
I just can't get away
I bet they'll even be rumors
Floating around on judgement day

I think I'll write my congress man
And tell him about Sophio
For the next time they catch
Somebody's starting rumors shoot to kill

Refrain: ...

What's mine is mine
I ain't got time for rumors in my life
I'm a man who thinks
Not a man who drinks
So please let me live my life
