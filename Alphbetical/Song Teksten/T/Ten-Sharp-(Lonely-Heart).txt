Baby I ask myself is there some
time for a lonely heart
Baby I ask myself is there some
love for a lonely heart

So you met another guy and danced
in the night away.
That look was in your eyes and
there was nothing I could say
so you met another guy and danced
in the night away. Ooh.

There was lots of music lots of
loving dancing all around
it didn't feel right and somehow
I knew why
there was lots of music lots of
loving dancing all around
it couldn't be yes from the start
I couldn't hold on to your heart

Baby I ask myself is there some
life after a lonely heart

So you met another guy and danced
in the night away.
That look was in your eyes and
there was nothing I could say
so you met another guy and danced
in the night away. 

There was lots of music lots of
loving dancing all around
it didn't feel right and somehow
I knew why
there was lots of music lots of
loving dancing all around
it couldn't be yes from the start
I couldn't hold on to your heart.
