
RAINDROPS KEEP FALLIN' ON MY HEAD - B.J.THOMAS

Raindrops keep falling on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his
Bed, nothing seems to fit. These
Raindrops keep falling on my head
They keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things 
Done, sleep in' on the job, these 
Raindrops keep falling on my head
They keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know, the blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me, won't be long till happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning
Red, crying's not for me, 'cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free, nothing's worryin' me.
