Title  : Let's Stay Together
Singer : Tina Turner


I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my life with you

Since, since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Chorus:
Let's stay together
Loving you whether
Whether times are good or bad
Happy or sad

Why, why people breake up
Turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me
Being around you is all I see

Chorus


Words & Music : Willie Mitchell, Al Green, Al Jackson
