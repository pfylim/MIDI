As I was awalkin' 'round Kilgary Mountain
I met Colonel Pepper and his money he was counting
I rattled my pistols and I drew forth me saber say:
Stand and deliver, for I am the bold deceiver !
Musha ri gumma do damma da
Whack fol the daddy o
whack fol the daddy o
there's whiskey in the jar.

The shining golden coins did look so bright and jolly,
I took'em with me home and I gave'em to my Molly;
she promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me,
but the devil's in the women and they never can be easy.

when I was awakened between six and seven,
the guard were all around me in numbers odd and even;
I flew my pistols, but alas, I was mistaken for Molly'd drawn
my pistols and a prisoner I was taken.

They put me in a jail without judge or writin',
for robbing Colonel Pepper on Kilgary Mountain
but they din't take my fists so I knocked the sentry down,
and bid a fond farewell to the jail in Slaigo town.

Now, some take delight in fishin' and bowlin',
and others take delight in their carriages arollin',
but I take delight in the juice of the barley,
and courtin' pretty girls in the mornin' so early.
