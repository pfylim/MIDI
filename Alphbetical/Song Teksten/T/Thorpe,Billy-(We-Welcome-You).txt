We welcome you
we welcome you
the journey has begun
we are glad you chose to come
we are the children of the sun
and we welcome you.

To the place where time and light are one
with the energy of a thousand suns
ships of light on a sea of stars
past the rings of Jupiter, canals of Mars
past the edge of time and our universe
it's an endless flight on an unknown course
thru a million lifetimes yet to come
fly the crystal ships and the children of the sun.

Thru colours man has never seen
past the places man could never dream
on beams of light the ships are spinning
to the place where life has its beginning
ooh ooh
ah ah ah
every muscle nerve and tissue aching
as at last the walls of time are breaking
down
down, down, down.
