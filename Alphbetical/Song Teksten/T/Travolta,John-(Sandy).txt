Title  : SANDY

(Words & music: Scott Simon/Louis St. Louis)

Stranded at the drive-in
Branded a fool
What will they say
Monday at school?

Sandy, can't you see
I'm in misery?
We made a start
Now we're apart
There's nothing left for me
Love has flown
All alone
I sit and wonder why, oh why
You left me, oh Sandy?

Oh Sandy baby, someday when high school is done
In heaven forever and ever we will be
Oh please, say you'll stay
Oh, Sandy

Spoken:
Sandy my darling, you've hurt me real bad
You know it's true
But baby, you gotta believe me when I say
I'm helpless without you

Love has flown all alone
I sit and wonder why
Oh why, you left me, oh Sandy

Sandy Sandy Sandy why
Oh Sandy
