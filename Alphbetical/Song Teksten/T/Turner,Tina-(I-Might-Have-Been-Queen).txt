I'm a new pair of eyes
every time I am born
an original mind
because I just died
I'm scanning the horizon
for someone recognizing
that I might have been queen.

For every sun that sets
there is a new one dawning
for every empire crushed
there is a new nation
let the waters rise
I have ridden each tide
from the gates of the city
where the first born died
and I might have been queen.

I remember the girl in the fields with no name
she had a love
oh, but the rivers won't stop for me
I'm a new pair of eyes
an original mind
with my senses of old
ans the heart of a giant
and I'm searching through the wreckage
for some recollection
that I might have been queen
for every sage that falls
there is an ancient child
and I might have been queen.

I remember the girl in the fields with no name
she had a love
ooooh, but the rivers won't stop for me
no, the rivers won't stop for me.

I look up to the stars
with my perfect memory
I look through it all
and my future's no shock to me
I look down but I see no tragedy
I look up to my past
a spirit running free
I look down and I'm there in history
I'm a soul survivor.

A soul survivor
on the river 
but it won't stop
I might have been queen
I know the secret combination
I'm a soul survivor.
