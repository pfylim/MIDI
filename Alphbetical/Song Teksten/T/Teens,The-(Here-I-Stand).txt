I never loved just one girl
until I met you.
You gave me something
straight from your heart
that's why I love you.

Now I've heard stories
behind my back
that you've found somebody new
now you must tell me
straight from the heart
say it isn't true.

Here I stand
here I stand
with my heart
and soul in your hands.

Here I stand,...

We'll meet tomorrow after school
in our usual place
what's that I see
tears on your face
don't you know I love you.

Here I stand,...
