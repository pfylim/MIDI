Title  : EVIDENTLY

Evidently I love you
Evidently you love me too
Evidently you know you couldn't do wrong by me

Evidently we got it together
Evidently like changin' the weather
Evidently we seem to make it if we try

For you and I stars and rainbow
Seem to shine with no regrets
For you and I every question
Is an answer in itself

Evidently I love you
Evidently you love me too
Evidently we seem to make it if we try

For you and I stars and rainbow
Seem to shine with no regrets
For you and I every question
Is an answer in itself

Evidently I love you
Evidently you love me too
Evidently you know you couldn't do wrong by me

Evidently my little darling
Evidently it's the answer in itself
Evidently evidently little darling
