Singer : TEACH IN 
Title  : ROSE VALLEY

I just left the town
I've been around, you know
For such a long time now
And I left behind the love I found
Because it didn't work out now
Thought the love was true
Now feeling blue
Who knows the reasons why
I am shivering in my coat
And hit the road
When only your love is mine

Our love in Rose Valley
That night in Rose Valley
The love we had that night
Was not for long

Still I don't regret
The things I've said
I didn't lie to you baby
I know me and you
We are thru
But you won't see me cry
After all these years
To hide the tears
You know, it's not so easy
But for that instead
I look ahead
And I will find somebody new

Our love in Rose Valley
That night in Rose Valley
The love we had that night
Was not for long

After all these years
To hide the tears
You know, it's not so easy
but for that instead
I look ahead
And I will find somebody new

Our love in Rose Valley
That night in Rose Valley
The love we had that night
Was not for long
