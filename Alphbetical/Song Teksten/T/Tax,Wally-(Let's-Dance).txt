Title  : LET'S DANCE

(Words & music: Wally Tax)

I see that old familiar face
I see that old familiar smile
When I'm in your warm embrace
You make me happy for a while

The band is softly playing
That old familiar song
And while we're gently swaying
I know we can't go wrong

Refrain:
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance together
Let's dance, let's dance
Let's dance forever

I smell those lilies of the valley
Oh, that old familiar scent
The sound of churchbells ringing
To an evening without end

I'll never leave you baby
If you'll have me around
And if you need me baby
You know where I'll be found

Refrain: ...
