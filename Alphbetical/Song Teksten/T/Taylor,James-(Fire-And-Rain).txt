  VSP

  Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone

  Susan the plans they made put an end to you

  
  Walked out this morning and I wrote down this song

  I just can't remember who to send it to


  WE'VE SEEN FIRE AND WE'VE SEEN RAIN

  WE'VE SEEN SUNNY DAYS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD NEVER END

  WE'VE SEEN LONELY TIMES WHEN WE COULD NOT FIND A FRIEND

  But I always thought I'd see you again


  Won't you look down upon me Jesus, you've got to help me make a stand

  Just got to see me through another day

  My body's aching and my time is at hand

  I won't make it through another day

  REFREIN


  I'm walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun

  Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around

  Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things

  to come

  Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground

  REFREIN

  But I always thought that I would see you ,baby, one more time again

  Thought I'd see you one more time again

  There just a few things coming my way this time around now

  Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you one more time again.......
