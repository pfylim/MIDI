Title  : WE LOVE THE PIRATE STATIONS

(Words & music: Carter/Stephens/Kennedy)

We love the pirate stations
The government wants to close them down
But we want them to stay
They're playing sounds that we all like
So don't take them away

When you're walking down the street
With your transistor radio
Everybody has a good time
You can dance to the beat
Of your transistor radio
Even when the sun don't shine
You can hear your favorite rock'n'roll
Rhythm and blues, with a lot of soul

Chorus:
We love the pirate stations
We love the pirate stations
Don't let them take 'em away
Don't let them take 'em away

There's some swinging dj's playing
Top 40 records, they can really urn you on
Now the government's trying to close
Down the stations
What'll happen when they're gone
You won't hear the music that you like
And old time of day or night

Chorus: ...
