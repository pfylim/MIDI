Songs for my valentine
Give the game away
In rhyme I make you mine
Sing all that
   I cannot say
I know mine are the tears
   I never cry
I know mine is a love
   I must deny
We go our seperate ways
With nothing but a smile
Hearts break in many ways
Oh how you've broken mine
I know mine are the arms
   you'll never hold
I know mine is a love
   remains untold
Hey hey sunny valentine
Come on shine your love my way
Songs for my valentine
Give the game away
Come on take it away
--------------------------------------------------------
I know mine are the tears
   I never cry
I know mine is a love 
   I must deny
Hey hey sunny valentine
Come on shine please
   shine your love my way
Ah come on and shine
You've got to shine please
   shine my way my way
Ah come on now shine
You've got to shine please
   shine my way
My turn my way my way
--------------------------------------------------------
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Oh come on now shine
You've got to shine please shine
