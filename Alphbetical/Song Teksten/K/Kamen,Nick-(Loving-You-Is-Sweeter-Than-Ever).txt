Oh I remember yet before we met
Every night and day had to live the life of a lonely one
Oh I remember meeting you
Discovering love could be so true
When shared by two instead of only one
Oh when you said you loved me
(When you said you loved me)
And we could not be parted
(And we could not be parted)
And that I could build my world around you
(Built my world around you)
I'm so thankful that I've found you
'cause loving you has made my life sweeter
Than ever
Oh Darling loving you
Has made my life sweeter than ever
Each night I pray we never part
For the love within my heart
Grows stronger from day to day
Oh it's just not fair how I've tried
To reassure you satisfy
'cause I'd be lost if you went away
Oh 'cause I really need you
('cause I really need you)
And I need for you to need me too
Oh baby
(I need for you to need me too)
I have built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
Girl I'm thankful that I've found you
'cause loving you has made my life sweeter
Than ever
Oh Darling come to me
Loving you has made my life sweeter
Than ever Oh baby
'cause I really love you
('cause I really love you)
Well I'm thankful that you love me too
(Thankful that you love me too)
Oh that I built my world around you
(Built my world around you)
And I'm truly glad I've found you
'cause loving you has made my sweeter
Than ever ...
