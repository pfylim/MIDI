I could never let you go
Even though I don't be so
It's so hard to decide
What can I do
Every time that I walk away
I think that I'll be bound to stay
Each step that I take
I need one to make
Away right back to you.

You're all I need
I feel it deep inside
So many times of times
To let you go
You're all I need
To keep me satisfied
I'll stay right by your side
Forever more.

Only you can understand
What it takes to hold your hands
Not to ever let go
'Cause your heart says no
If leavin' you makes me strong
It's not gonna last too long
I'm in a terrible stage
I don't want to wait
I just gotta let you know

You're all I need,...

I need just one reason
To make it through the season
There's no one to even
The love and joy you bring.

You're all I need,...
