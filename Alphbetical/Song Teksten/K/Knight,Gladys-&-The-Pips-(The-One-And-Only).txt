Singer : GLADYS KNIGHT & THE PIPS 
Title  : THE ONE AND ONLY

(Words & music: Alan Bergman/Marilyn Bergman/Patric Williams)

When you find the one and only
It's like findin' a needle in the hay
Ev'ry one of us is lookin' for love
So when love comes along 
You can't let it get away

When you're someones one and only
And she says that she's nothing without you
When at last you know where you belong
Then you're one of the chosen few
Yes, you're one of the chosen few

Well, I found my one and only
Like the long, lonesome rivers finds the sea
And I can't believe how lucky I was
That you and your lovers were waiting around for me

You're my darling one and only
I've got no more lookin' left to do
With a love as sweet as ours I know
That I'm one of the chosen few
Yes, I'm one of the chosen few
