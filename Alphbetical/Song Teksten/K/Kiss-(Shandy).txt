Singer : KISS
Title  : SHANDI

(Words & music: Paul Stanley/Vini Poncia)

I just can't pretend no more
I keep runnin' out of lies
Loving you is killing me inside
Every time I find the words to end it
Something in your eyes won't let it

Chorus:
Shandi
Tonight must last us forever
Forever, we say goodnight and go home
But you know me very well
And I know you
You can tell me goodnight, say goodnight

We've been holding so tight
We're afraid to let it go
Shake it loose, we both could use the ride
Here's another mess I got myself in
And when you touch me, you ain't helpin'

Chorus: ...

Say goodnight
When we could say goodbye

Chorus: ...
