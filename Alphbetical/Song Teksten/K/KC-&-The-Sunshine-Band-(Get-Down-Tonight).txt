Title  : GET DOWN TONIGHT

Baby babe let's get together honey me and you
And do the things oh do the things that we like to do

Oh do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

Baby babe I'll meet you same place, same time
Where we can oh get together and ease up our mind

Oh do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight
Do a little dance, make a little love
Get down tonight, get down tonight

Get down, get down, get down, get down
Get down, tonight baby
Na na na na na na na na na na na baby
This very minute child, oh
