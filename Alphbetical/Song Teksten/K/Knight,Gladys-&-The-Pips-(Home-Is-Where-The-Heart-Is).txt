Title  : HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS

(Words & music: Van McCoy/Joe Cobb)

Whether my feet are walking
Down the dusty roads of Jackson
Or the star studded pavement of L.A.
Honey, I find my thoughts returning
Like a bee searching and sifting
For a nest I left a thousand miles away

Chorus:
'Cause home is where the heart is
Not the towns I'm drifting through
When I spread my wings and flew away, girl
I left my heart right here with you

Whether my eyes are gazing
At the lovely sights of Paris
Or the beauty of the seven hills of Rome
Yeah, honey I find my true emotion
Like the ebb tide of the ocean
Rolling back to embrace the shores of home

Chorus: ...

Your love was a bridge that I burned
After I crossed it
I never knew what I had until I lost it

Ooh ooh ooh whether my arms are holding
A pretty girl in Memphis
Or kissing someone new in Buffalo
Yeah honey I find my feeling drifting
Through a field of wheat
Where flowers used to grow

Chorus: ...
