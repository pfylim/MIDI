1) They asked me how I knew my true love was true
   I of course replied something here inside
   cannot be denied

2) they said someday you'll find
   all who love are blind
   when your heart's on fire you must realize
   skome get's in your eyes
--------------------------------------------------------
Refrain: So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
         to think they could doubt my love
         yet today my love has flown away
         I am without my love
--------------------------------------------------------
3) Now laughing friends deride tears I cannot hide
   so I smile and say when a lovely flame dies
   smoke get's in your eyes
