KON KAN - I BEG YOUR PARDON

(Ah here we go)
There once was a time and there once was a way
We had something going and to my dismay
Attention to me seemed to drift
Though I don't know where
And when we're alone
Seems there's nothing to say
I bring up the topic
You push it away
You say that you do
But I think it's just you don't care
Why do I feel you're using me

Are we an item or are we just two
I need some commitment's all I ask of you
Your life's stuck and change
Don't be afraid what you think's in store

I know what's on your mind you've got lots to lose
Your shallow acquaintance is what's there to choose
You won't get too deep even though I want so much more
So think about it carefully

(Smile for a while and let's be jolly)
(Li-li-life shouldn't be so melancholy)
(Come-come-come-come along share the good times)
(Wh-wh-while we can)

(Yeah rock)
(Do you want to hustle)
(Freak that's right)
(Rock do you want to salsa)
(Freak that's right)
(Rock do you want  to hustle)
(Freak that's right )
(Rock do you want to salsa ah)

If that's how you want it that's how it'll will be
There's no use in trying or making you see
That love don't come easy you don't know what it's about
To get things together I'm taking the pain
Don't need to see or hear from you never again
From this day I'm messing but no more can't help me out
And you know what I'm talking about

(Smile for a while and let 's be jolly)
(Li-li-life shouldn't be so melancholy)
(Come-come-come-come along share the good times)
(Wh-wh-while we can)
I know now's the time
That I went to find something else
You know it's your crime
That I'm out to find someone too
