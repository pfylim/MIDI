Roses of red fall on my head
He smiled then turned away
Roses of red grow in my heart
They bloom
When he passes me by
'Cause he he makes me happy
And he he makes me fly
Oh, oh, oh..
I bloom
When he passes me by

If you want paradise
Then look at my eyes
I'm as clear as the sky
When it's blue
If you want paradise
Then look at me twice
'Cause I'm not a normal red rose

And he makes me crazy
And he makes me fly
Oh, oh, oh...
I bloom when he passes me by

I know that he doesn't know me
He's just too different
He knows I know
We.re just too differrent no no

Roses of red fall on my head
He smiled then turned away
Roses of red grow in my heart
They bloom
When he passes me by
'Cause he he makes me happy
And he he makes me fly
Oh, oh, oh..
I bloom
When he passes me by
Oh, oh, oh..
I bloom
When he passes me by
Oh, oh, oh..
Smiled and turned away
