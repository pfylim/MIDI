Title  : ONLY YOU KNOW AND I KNOW

(Words & music: Dave Mason)

Only you know and I know
All the loving we have to show
So don't refuse to believe it
By reading too many things

Refrain:
'Cause you know that I mean what I say
So don't go and ever take me the wrong way
And you know you can't go on getting your own way
'Cause if you do, I'm gonna get you some day

We're both here to be pleasing
Oh, no no not deceiving
But it's hard to believe in
When you've been so mistreated

If I've seemed to mislead you
It's just my craziness coming through
But when it comes down to just two
I ain't no crazier than you
