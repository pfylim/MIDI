Title  : BEST FRIEND I KNOW

(Words & music: ...)

Patricia:
If I had words, words to say
If I had time to write you everyday
You're my sister, my sister you will stay
And I'm so glad I have a chance to say

Yvonne:
Living without you so far away
Thinking about you down in L.A.
You're my sister, my sister you will stay
And I do remember how we used to play

Chorus:
Don't forget it, you're the best friend I know
A sister and a brother all the way
Always remember, don't forget it
You're the best friend I know
If you need me then I'll be on my way

We grew up together in fantasy world
Changing clothes, fantasy words
We were fantasy girls
You were Gable and I was Monroe
We were stars in every tv show

Moments of laughter, crying nights
Crazy games, pillow fights
Going to the movies, always home too late
And I still remember, how we used to say

Chorus: ...
