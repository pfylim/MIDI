Title  : DAVID'S SONG

(Words & music: Vladimir Cosma/Dan Kelly)

Who'll come with me
Don't be afraid, I know the way
Who'll sing with me
Don't be afraid, I'll show the way

Who'll dance with me all through the world
Don't be afraid, I'll show the way

We'll go with you
We searched the way to find your star
Who'll come with us
Don't be afraid, I know the way

Who'll fly with me to reach the star
Don't be afraid, I know the way

*spoken*
Hello to all you young ones
Our fondest hopes now rest in you
Remember there's nothing you can't do
So believe and be brave

Who'll be my friend
And walk with me, and sing this song
Who'll love with me
We'll change the world and set it free

We'll walk with you, we'll be your frien
We'll sing your song, we know the way
