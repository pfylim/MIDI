        I promised myself        Nick Kamen


I promised myself I promised I'll wait for you
the midnight hour I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers you made my dreams come true

Refrain

How many of a sound will feel the need
to run and look for shelter


I promised myself that I take care of you
when you tomorrow with all your might come true
I promised myself that I make it up to you
not sister and brother no I'm in love with you

Refrain

How many of a sound will feel the pain
I'm loosing what we've once had god I know
what people say about her no more stay
who can live without her

Refrain

How many of a sound will feel the pain
I'm loosing what we've once had god I know
what people say about her no more stay
who can live without her


I promised myself I promised I'll wait for you
the midnight hour I know you'll shine on through
I promised myself I promised the world to you
I gave you flowers you made my dreams come true
