Intro     

All bound for mu mu land, all bound for mu mu land, hey. 


Hey, hey, all bound for mu mu land, 
hey, hey, all bound for mu mu land. 

Refrain 1 

They`re justified and they`re ancient, 
and they like to roam the land. 
They`re justified and they`re ancient, 
I hope you`ll understand. 


They called me up in Tennessee, 
they`ve said Tammy, stand by the dance. 
But if you don`t like what they`re going to do, 
you`d better not stop because they`re coming through. 


Hey, hey, all bound for mu mu land, 
hey, hey, all bound for mu mu land. 
Mu mu land, mu mu land, all bound for mu mu land. 


Refrain 2  

They`re justified and they`re ancient, 
and they`re driving us insane. 
They`re justified and they`re ancient, 
we`ve still no master plan. 


The last thing left an hour before, 
they were singing all at once. 
All bound for mu mu land, 
then someone started screaming.... 

Hey, Hey,all bound .....
