You turn my night into days
lead me mysterious way
made me feel like a new man
it's like I'm born once again
it's you, I know it's you.

You cause desire and pain
tangle me up in your chain
you made me the slave of your love
but it feels like heaven above
it's you, I know it's you.

And it's a real good feeling
you got me rocking and reeling
you gor me begging and stealing
for your sweet love
but it's a real good feeling
you got me rocking and reeling
you gor me begging and stealing
for your sweet love.

Your magic is filling the air
I need you know I care
you are the one I adore
leaving me begging for more
it's you, for ever you.

And it's a real good feeling,...
