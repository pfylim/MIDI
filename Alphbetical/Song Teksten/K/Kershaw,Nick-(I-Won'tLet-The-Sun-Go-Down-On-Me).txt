NIK KERSHAW - I WON'T LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME

Forty winks in the lobby
Make mine a g and t
Then to our favorite hobby
Searching for an enemy

Here in our paper houses
Stretching for miles and miles
Old man in stripey trousers
Rules the world with plastic smiles

Good or bad like it or not
It's the only one we've got

Refrain:
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down

Mother nature isn't in it
Three hundred million years
Goodbye just a minute
Gone forever no more tears
Pinball man power glutton
Vacuum inside his head
Forefinger on the button
Is he blue or is he red

Break your silence if you would
Before the sun goes down for good

Refrain: ...

I won't let the sun go down on me
I won't let the sun go down
