Title  : LOLA
Artist : THE KINKS

(Words & music: Ray Davies)

I met her in a club down in old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes like Cherry cola
See-oh el-aye cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice
She said: Lola, el-oh-el-aye, Lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

Well I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight
She nearly broke my spine, oh my Lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

Well, we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electic candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said: Dear boy, won't you come home with me?

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
When I looked in her eyes, well, I almost feel
For my Lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
When I looked in her eyes, well, I almost feel
For my Lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

I pushed her away, I walked to the door
I fall to the floor, I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

Girls will be boys, and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook-up world
Except for Lola
La, la, la, la, Lola

Well, I left home just a week before
And I never ever kissed a woman before
But Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said: Dear boy, I'm gonna make you a man

Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
La, la, la, la Lola
