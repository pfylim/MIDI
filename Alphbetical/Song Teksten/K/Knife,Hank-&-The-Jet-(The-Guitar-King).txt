Only eighteen only grown
tryin' to make his luc k away from home
guitar in his hand and he's a saint
dwelling places he should go far
one day he'll be a record star
and people come from far to watch him play
-----------------------------------------------
He comes along just in time every thing in bow
he writes his song a million copies sold
he plays his music loud and grey
deshoping my old frames
the new born king is on his way to fame
-----------------------------------------------
Refrain:
   He makes you dance and be makes you sing
   come on let's go for the guitar king
   his music is like healing from the griets
   He makes you dance and be makes you sing
   come on let's go for the guitar king
   he makes you dance and sing he's the guitar king
-----------------------------------------------
On his strait she's dynamite
driving people wild inside
let's even rock like no one did before
every week he's on tv 
and shows you what you want to see
he shake's his legs until the lights go out
------------------------------------------------
He comes along just in time every thing in bow
he writes his song a million copies sold
he plays his music loud and grey
deshoping my old frames
the new born king is on his way to fame
-----------------------------------------------
Refrain:
   He makes you dance and be makes you sing
   come on let's go for the guitar king
   his music is like healing from the griets
   He makes you dance and be makes you sing
   come on let's go for the guitar king
   he makes you dance and sing he's the guitar king
