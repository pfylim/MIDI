Title  : WINTERTIME

How a changin' scene
Rearranging trees
Signs of things to come right now
A cold wintertime

Days become less day
A returning play
Many creatures sleep right now
A cold wintertime

It's wintertime now
Flakes whirling down down
But I'm alright so I can find
A way to see the bright side
It's wintertime now
I'm feeling fine now
Yes I'm alright and I can find
A way to see the bright side

Silence all around
Quiet is the sound
Of the distant howlin' hound
A cold wintertime

Everything is free
To a high degree
You will give me peace of mind
A cold wintertime
