(Words & music: Keith Bonsoir/J. Olofson)

Chorus:
Laven, lavender blue
Girl, I am missing you
And nights are getting lonelier
Because I love you

Laven, lavender blue
Do you get lonely too
When your emotions let you down
Because you love me
Don't give up
Just hold on while you can
To be apart would break your heart

Chorus: ...

Love is all
A dreamer has to dream
My home is where your heart should be
My lavender, lavender blue

Chorus: ...

So much pain I feel inside
And all my love I just can't hide
I'm waiting for you
My lavender blue

Chorus: ...
