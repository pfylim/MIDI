KOOL & THE GANG - CHERISH

Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (ooh)
Cherish the love cherish the live (so much love)
Cherish the love

Cherish the love we have (oh yeah)
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love (baby) cherish the life
Cherish the love

The world is always changing nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have (ooh yeah)
We should cherish the life we live (baby yeah)
Cherish the love cherish the live (oh yeah)
Cherish the love (ooh)

Cherish the love we have (now we're together)
For as long as we both shall live (the love)
Cherish the love cherish the life
Cherish the love

Cherish the love cherish the life

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love cherish the life
Cherish the love

Cherish the love we have
(every night when I think about you)
For as long as we both shall live
(I breath and I dream for two)
Cherish the love cherish the life
Cherish the love
