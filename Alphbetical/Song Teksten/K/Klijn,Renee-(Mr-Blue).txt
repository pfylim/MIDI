                      MR.BLUE

   Wintersounds the crying like an old man slowly dying
   And the only sound the wind that fills the trees
   Even colder cones the moon and though it never seems to soon 
   A sudden stilness as the rain fall starts to freeze

   I'M MISTER BLUE, I'M HERE TO STAY WITH YOU
   AND NO MATTER WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE LONELY, I'LL BE LONELY TOO
   OH MISTER BLUE I'M HERE TO STAY WITH YOU AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO
   WHEN YOU'RE LONELY, I'LL BE LONELY TOO

   A young girl she is shaded bears the scars that never faded
   Of the baby that was born on christmas day
   While the heavens sing their song a child's life is never long
   Cause the food suppplies will only last a day

   Patriot emotion is the cause of the commotion after all 
   there's really no one here to blame
   Soldier's taking orders cause we must defend the borders of our nation
   and the other side's the same

   Come to you at night when all the world is sleeping tight
   And lie beside you till the early morning dew
   You can't hear me you can't see me you can feel me when I read the folded
                                                                 /letter

   She left addressed to you

   REFREIN
