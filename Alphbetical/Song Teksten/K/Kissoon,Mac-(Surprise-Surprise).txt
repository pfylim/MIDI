Title  : SURPRISE, SURPRISE

(Words & music: B. Ruyter/J. Hermeler)

I sailed across the mighty ocean
Traveled round the U.S.A.
Didn't have a destination
No place to stay
One night in Malibu motel
Just before I fell asleep
I heard that knocking on my door
Who could that be?

Chorus:
Surprise, surprise
Standing before my very eyes
This can't be true
Is it a dream or really you?
...2x...

You know that sometimes strange things happen
Then everything is upside down
You get that funny feeling
Someon's around
When you hear that knocking
You feel it's about to come
She'll step inside spontaneously
Don't try to run

Chorus: ...3x...
