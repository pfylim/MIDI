To be home again in England
To be where I belong, where I belong
When the lonely night is drawing in
I long to be with you in England
Is it still the same in England
I've been away so long, away so long
Are you still waiting there for me my love
I'll soon be home again in England
To be home again, home in England
To be where I belong, where I belong
When the lonely night is drawing in
I long to be with you in England
We'll sit by a fire-side
We'll laugh and we'll sing
We'll walk down a country lane on sunday morning
I've waited so long to be with you again
Oh how I learn, oh how I yearn to be home again
We'll sit by a fire-side
We'll laugh and we'll sing
We'll walk down a country lane on a sunday morning
I've waited so long to be with you again
Oh how i yearn, oh how I yearn to home again in England
To be where I belong, where I belong
When the lonely night is drawing in
I long to be with you in England.
