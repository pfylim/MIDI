It seems in a moment, your whole world can shatter
like morning dreams they just disappear
like dust in your hand falling to the floor
how can life ever be the same

'Cos my heart is broken in peaces
yes my heart is broken in peaces
since you've been gone

it's all to easy to take so much for granted
but it's so hard to find the words to say
like a castle in the sand the water takes away
how can life ever be the same

'Cos my heart is broken in peaces
yes my heart is broken in peaces
since I've lost you

Ooh now you'll never know
all the things I planned for you
things for you and me

I held your hand so tightly
that I couldn't let it go
now how can life ever be the same

cos my heart is broken in peaces
yes my heart is broken in peaces
since you've been gone
