Say baby you been lookin' real good
I remember when we met
funny how it never felt so good
it's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
ooh it was the best time I can remember
ooh and the love we shared - is lovin' that'll
last forever

There wasn't much in this heart of mine
there was a little left and babe you found it
it's funny how I never felt so high
it's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
ooh it was the best time I can remember
ooh and the love we shared - is lovin' that'll
last forever

I think about you
honey all the time my heart says yes
I think about you
deep inside I love you best
I think about you
you know you're the one I want
I think about you
darlin' you're the only one
I think about you

Somethin' changed in this heart of mine
an' I'm so glad that ya showed me
funny how I never felt so high
it's a feelin' that I know
I know I'll never forget
ooh it was the best time I can remember
ooh and the love we shared - is lovin' that'll
last forever.
