Intro 1: Heavy Guitar

Vers 1:
I've been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel
There's a voice in my head  that drives my heel
It's my baby callin', says "I need you here!"
And it's a half past four and I'm shifting gear.
When she is lonely here, the longing gets too much
She sends a cable coming in from above
Don't need no phone at all!

1.Refrain:
We've got a thing  and that's called "Radar Love"
We've got a wave  in the air - Radar Love!
Bridge: Bass + Drums

Vers 2:
The radio is playing some forgotten song: Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
The road has got me hypnotised     and I'm speeding into a new sunrise
When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She send her comfort coming in from above -
We don't need no letters at all!

2.Refrain:
We've got a thing  that's called "Radar Love"
We've got a line in the sky - Break

Vers 3:
No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song: Brenda Lee's "Coming On Strong"
And the newsman sang his same song   - oh, one more "Radar Lover" gone.
When I get I lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above - 
We don't need no letters at all!

We've got a thing that's called "Radar Love".
We've got a line in the sky
