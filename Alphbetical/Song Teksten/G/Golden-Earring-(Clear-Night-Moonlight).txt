GOLDEN EARRING - CLEAR NIGHT MOONLIGHT

I wanna go ahead, until I just run out of gas
I wanna beat the road with four-wheel thunder
There's a cadillac dealer in Kansas City counting money
And the highway patrol ain't going nowhere

Don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze

On a clear night moonlight
You and me and the car
Under a thousand stars
That's all the magic we need
So, don't you go turning my dream
Into a nightmare
C'mon, let's ride right out of here

Imagine you and I, leavin' it all behind
Find another world, beyond the turnpike
There'll be lots of people uptight maybe some FBI
And your daddy screaming bloody murder

Don't say no, don't make me grieve
Don't say no, you gotta feel the breeze

Picture the two of us
We're so happy, so much in love
You know the story goes:
At the end of the rainbow
There's a bag of gold
