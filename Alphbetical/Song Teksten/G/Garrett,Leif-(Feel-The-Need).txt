See how, I'm walkin'
see how, I'm talkin'
notice everything in me.

Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
I need you by my side to be my guide
can't you see my arms are open wide, oh.

Feel the need, oh feel the need in me
ev'ry day I need it, ev'ry way I need it,
withous your sweet, sweet love I'd rather die
I need it constantly, your love takes care of me,
you're always sweeter to me than applepie.

Just put your hand in mine 
love me all the time
the truth you will plainly see
feel the need, oh feel, oh feel the need in me
I need you on the case to leave my heart in place
you make me what I need in me,
Ev'ry day I need it, ev'ry way I need it,...

Your love is tough, now can't get enough, girl
your love is so important to me
l the need, oh feel the need in me
I need you on the case,...
sea,...
