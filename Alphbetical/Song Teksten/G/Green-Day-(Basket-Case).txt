2. BASKET CASE - GREEN DAY

Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it.

Sometimes I give myself to the creeps 
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid?
I'm just stoned

I went to a shrink
to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore
he said my life is a bore
And ain't my whining cause
It's bringing her down

Grasping to control
So you better hold on....

Sometimes I give myself to the creeps 
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm crackin' up
Am I just paranoid?
