We all come in from the cold
we come down from the wire
an everybody warms themselves
to a different fire
when sometimes we get burned
you'd think sometime we'd learn
the one you love is the one
that should take you higher
you ain't got no one
you better go back out and find her

Just like children hidin' in a closet
can't tell what's goin' on outside
sometimes we're so far off the beaten track
we'll get a taken for a ride
by a parlor trick or some words of wit
a hidden hand up a sleeve
to think that the one you love
could hurt you now
is a little hard to believe
but everybody darlin' sometimes
bites the hand that feeds

When I look around
everybody always brings me down
well is it them or me well I just can't see
but there ain't no peace to be found
but if some one really cared
well they'd take the time to spare
a moment to try and understand
another one's despair
remember in this game we call life that no one
said it's fair

Breakdown
let me hear it now
Breakdown
let me hear it now
yeah
Breakdown
let me hear it now
Breakdown
let me hear it now
get down with yo' bad self
alright

I've come to know the cold
I think of it as home
when there ain't enough of me to go around
I'd rather be left alone
but if I call you out of habit I'm out of love and
I gotta have it
would you give it to me if I fit your needs
like when we both knew we had it
but now the damage's done
and we're back out on the run
funny how ev'rything was roses
when we held on to the guns
just because you're winnin'
don't mean you're the lucky ones

Breakdown
let me hear it now
Yeah
Breakdown
Breakdown
let me hear it now

There goes the challenger being chased
by the blue blue meanies on wheels
the vicious traffic squad cars are after
our lone driver
the last american hero
the the electric sintar
the demi god
the super driver of the golden west
two nasty Nazi cars are close behind
the beautiful lone driver
the police cars are getting closer closer...
closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
yeah baby
they about to strike, they gonna get him
smash ! Rape!
the last beautiful free soul opn this planet

But... it is written if the evil spirit arms
the tiger with claws
brahman provided wings for the dove
thus spake the super guru
did you hear that.
