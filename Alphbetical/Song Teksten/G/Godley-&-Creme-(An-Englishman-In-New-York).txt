Title  : AN ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK

(Words & music: Kevin Godley/Lol Creme)

Demented New York athletes staggering round the block
Deformed Chicanos pour in, Chicago's rolling stock
Digital bathrooms drilling for furs
Surgical stockings marked his and hers
Guggenheim attitudes back to back
With Jewish Baroque

No way street, no way street
Happy to see you, have a nice day

Defecting Russian dancers dance into Hockney prints
Exclusive to Bloomingdales, gift-wrapped in red
From the land of blue rinse
They boggle at menus in Olde English verse
Ode to a burger by Keats at his worst
The hissing of omelettes, the breaking of legs
Don't shoot till you see the whites of their eggs
The pink filet mignon looks black on the negs

Chorus:
Strange apparatus
You've never seen
Strange apparatus
Even stranger theme
Street alligators
Big Anglophile
Will navigate us through a change of style

I came, I saw, what manner of beast is this
New York, you talk a little bit left of center
A scream, a shout
New York is throwing its weight about
Walk tall, walk straight, spit the world right in the eye
The stronger the wood, the straighter the arrow
Dismembered hopeful My-Lai veterans queuing for sleaze
Sorry no dogs, no fags, no shriners and no amputees
Sexual athlete applies for audition
Willing to make it in any position
Just one of the extras with blood on their faces
In snow-white and the seven basket cases
I'm happy and dopey and dirty in places
No way street
No way street
Lock up your daughters, Avon crawling

Devoted collectors of paraphernalia out walking the rock
Battle and bitch for the ultimate kitch
Of a crucifix clock
Two miniature romans, running on rails
Appear every hour and bang in the nails
I've got to have it, Christ, I gotta be the first
On the block

Disturbing facts about Nazi splinter groups seen on the news
They're picketing synagogues and claimig
That Hitler was the king of the Jews
Caught in the tunnel an ambulance howls
A men's room attendant is flopping his jowls
Sshh, Howard Johnson is moving his bowels

Chorus: ...

Strange apparatus
You've never seen
Strange apparatus
Even stranger theme
Walk tall, walk straight, spit the world right in the eye
The stronger the wood, the straighter the arrow

No way street
No way street
