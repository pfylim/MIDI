You dance to the music like nobody does
The first time I saw you, I knew it was love

You're the one that I want
You're the one, yes, you are

My heart is on fire, the night is divine
My only desire is making you mine

When you're in motion, you seem not to care
You hide your emotion, no joy, no despair
