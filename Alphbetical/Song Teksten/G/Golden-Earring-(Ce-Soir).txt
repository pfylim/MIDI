Singer : GOLDEN EARRING 
Title  : CE SOIR

Remember that song called "Kill me"
From Vick Timm's last LP
Too much of a risk for a golden disc
The price he paid for money

Refrain:
Ce soir, ce soir
Assassination d'un rock'n'roll star

Sing your song you can't go wrong
Assumpted his business adviser
No need for alarm, you'll come to no harm
He didn't mention the sniper

Refrain: ...

The news is read
The poison's spread
One yawn ah, two yawn ah
And back to bed
Turn of the light and hold me tight
Come on, maman, bend down your head
And just sing on, immortal song
Fini belle vie

Vick played the part
With all his heart
He was not prepared for the shock
When howling lead
Bit into his head
A new martyr for the book of rock
