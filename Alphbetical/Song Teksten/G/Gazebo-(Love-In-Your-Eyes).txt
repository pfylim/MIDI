I love you Jean
But I can't go out tonight
in the machine
all my thoughts are bound so tight
living in recording studios
makes me feel awake
life is just a brand new echo
digital delay.

Love in your eyes
oh, baby don't you realize
it's only love in your eyes
oh, baby got to compromise
it's only love.

I love you too
but you make me feel so sad
a Mini Moog is just all you need so bad
you were just a damn sequencer
moving to the beat
living with a sythesizer
cold as a repeat.

Love in your eyes
oh, baby don't you realize
it's only love in your eyes
oh, baby got to compromise
it's only love.

Input output
input output.

I love you Jean
but I can't stand you no more
why do you scream ?
I can't hear the monitor
you voice needs a equalizer
try to sing the song
filtered in the harmonizer
we can't get along.

Love in your eyes
oh, baby don't you realize
it's only love in your eyes
oh, baby got to compromise
it's only love.
