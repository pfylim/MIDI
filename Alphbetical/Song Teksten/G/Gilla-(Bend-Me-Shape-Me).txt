Title  : BEND ME, SHAPE ME

(Words & music: Scott English/Laurence Weiss)

You are all the woman need
And baby, you know it
You can make this beggar a king
A clown or a poet

I'll give you all that I own
You got me standing in line
Out in the cold, pay me some mind

Chorus:
Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
Long as you love me
It's alright
Bend me, shape me
Anyway you want me
You got the power
To turn on the light

Ev'rybody tells me I'm wrong
To want you so badly
But there's a force driving me on
I follow it gladly
So let them laugh, I don't care
'Cause I got nothing to hide
All that I want is you by my side

Chorus: ...
