Talk to me softly
there's somthing in your eyes
don't hang your head in sorrow
and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside I've
I've  been there before
somethin's changin' inside you
and don't you know

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
don't you cry tonight
don't you cry tonight
there's a heaven above you baby
and don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper
and give me a sigh
give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
dont' you take it so hard now
and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinkin' of you
and the times we had.....baby

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you baby
don't you cry tonight
don't you cry tonight
there's a heaven above you baby
and don't you cry tonight

And please remember that I never lied
and please remember 
how I felt inside now honey
you gotta make it your own way
but you'll be alright now sugar
you'll feel better tomorrow
come the morning light now baby

And don't you cry tonight
an don't you cry tonight
an don't you cry tonight
there's a heaven above you baby
and don't you cry
don't you ever cry
don't you cry tonight
baby maybe someday
don't you cry
don't you ever cry
don't you cry
tonight.
