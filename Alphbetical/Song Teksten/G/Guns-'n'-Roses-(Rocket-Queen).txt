If I say I don't need anyone
I can say these things to you
'cause
I can turn on anyone
just like I've turned on you
I've got a tounge like a razor
a sweet switchblade knife
and I can do you favours
but then you'll do whatever I like

Chorus:
Here I am
and you're a rocket queen 
I might be a little young
but honey I ain't naive
here I am
and you're a rocket queen oh yeah
I might be too much
but honey you're a bit obscene

I've seen everythibng imaginable
pass before these eyes
I've had everything that's tangible
honey you'd be surprised
I'm an sexual innuendo
in this burned out paradise
if you turn me on to anything
you better turn me on tonight

Chorus:
I see you standing
standing on your own
It's such a lonely place for you
for you to be
if you need a shoulder
or if you need a friend
I'll be here standing
until the bitter end
no one needs the sorrow
no one needs the pain
I hate to see you
walking out there
out in the rain
so don't chastise me
or think I, I mean you harm
of those that take you
leave you strung out
much too far
baby-yeah

Don't ever leave me 
say you'll always be there
all I ever wanted
was for you
to know that I care.
Hear this voice from deep inside
it's the call of your heart.
