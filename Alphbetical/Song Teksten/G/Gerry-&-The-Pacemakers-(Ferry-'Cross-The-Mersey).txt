          Ferry cross the Mercy


Life goes on day alter day
hearts torn in every way

So ferry cross the mercy 'cause this land's
the place I love and here I'll stay

People around in every corner
they seem to smile and say
we don't care what your name is boy
we'll never turn aou away

So I'll continue to say
here's wehre I always will stay

So ferry cross the mercy `cause this land's
the place I love and here I'll stay
and here I'll stay and here I'll stay
