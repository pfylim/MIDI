Title  : Patience
Singer : Guns 'n Roses


Shed a tear 'cause I'm missing you
I'm still alright to smile
Girl I think about you ev'ry day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure by you
Set my mind at ease there is no doubt
You're in my heart now

Chorus:
Said woman take it slow
It'll work itself out
All we need is a little patience
Said sugar make it slow
And come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
We won't fake it
I'll never break it
Guess I can take it

I sit here on the stairs
Cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now
I'll wait dear
Sometimes I get so tense
But I can't speed up the time
But you know love
There's one more thing to consider

Chorus:
Said woman take it slow
And, things will just be fine
If you and I just use
A little patience
Said sugar take the time
Cause the lights are shining bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it
We won't fake it ...
