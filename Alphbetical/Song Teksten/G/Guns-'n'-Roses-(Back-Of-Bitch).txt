Oh baby, pretty baby
oh honey, you let me down honey
I ain't playin' childhood games no more
I said it's time for me to even the score
so stake your claim, your claim to fame
but baby call another name
when you feel the fire, and taste the flame

Back off, back off bitch
down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
you better, back off, back off bitch
face of an angel with the love of a witch
back off, back off bitch
back off, back off bitch

Makin' love
cheap heartbreaker, broken backed
nasty ballbreaker, stay out of my bead
outta my head
if it's lovin' you, I'm better off dead

Back off, back off bitch
down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
you better, back off, back off bitch
face of an angel with the love of a witch
back off, back off bitch
back off, back off bitch

Emotions ripped, gone on a binge
life lipped, I said you're off the hinge
tellin' lies of such fame and glory
I don't even wanna hear your story

Back off, back off bitch
down in the gutter dyin' in the ditch
you better, back off, back off bitch
face of an angel with the love of a witch
back off, back off bitch
it's such a pity that you're such a bitch
back off, back off bitch
it's time tu burn burn the witch
back off, back off bitch
back off, back off bitch
back off, back off bitch
bitch
bitch
bitch
bitch

Hey wha'd'ya think he's tryin' to say there
anyway ?
I think it's some thing each person's
s'posed to take in their own special way fucking bitch.
