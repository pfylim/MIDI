Title  : HOW DO YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART

(Words & music: Findon/Myers)

Love, how many times do I have to tell you why
How many times do you have to see me cry
I love you, you know I do
Oh love, how many times have you gotta hear me say
How many times must I beg of you please stay
Without you, can't see it through

Chorus:
How do you mend a broken heart, beyond repair
And torn apart, I ask you
A heart that's old and wearing thin, so tired of
All the suffering, I ask you
Oh oh, we can see it through if you want me too
But you know I can't pretend
Oh tell me, tell me, from the start
How you're gonna mend a broken heart

Gone, where is the love that once we felt so strong
Lost like the words of an old forgotten song
Without you, I can't hold on

Chorus: ...2x...
