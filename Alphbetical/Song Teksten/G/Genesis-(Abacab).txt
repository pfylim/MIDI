Look up on the wall, 
there on the floor,
under the pillow,
behind the door.
There's a crack in the mirror.
Somewhere there's a whole in the window pane.
Do you think I'm to blame ?
Tell me do you think I'm to blame ?

(When they do it) you're never there.
(When they show it) you stop and stare.
(ABACAB) he's in anywhere.
(ABACAB) if you're wrapping up the world
'cause you've taken someone else's girl.
When they turn on the pillow;
even when they answer the telephone.
Don't you think that by now ?
Tell me don't you think that by now ?

(When they do it) you're never there.
(When they show it) you stop and stare.
(ABACAB) he's in anywhere.
(ABACAB) doesn't really care.
Do you want it ? You've got it. Now you know.
Do you want it ? You've got it. Now you know.

It's an illusion.
It's a game, a reflection
of someone else's name.
When you wake in the morning,
wake and find you're covered in celophane.
well there's a hole in there somewhere.
Yeah there's a hole in there somewhere.
Baby there's a hole in there somewehre.
Now  there's a hole in there somewhere.
(When they do it) you're never there.
(When they show it) you stop and stare.
(ABACAB) he's in anywhere.
(ABACAB).
in't right
