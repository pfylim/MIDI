COLDCUT - PEOPLE HOLD ON

People hold on ooh ooh
Everybody's looking for a meaning
Everybody's doing their own thing
And nobody's solving the problem
Ain't nobody helping each other
Some people give into fear
Some people give into hunger
Some of us live for the future
Mmm and some of us wonder

Give a little light
Give a little love
Baby there's enough for everyone
Give a little hope
And a little trust
Baby there's enough for everyone
