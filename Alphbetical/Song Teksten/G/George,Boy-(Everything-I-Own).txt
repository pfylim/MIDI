Titel:         EVERYTHING I OWN

Interpret:     BOY GEORGE


You sheltered me from harm,
You kept me warm, kept me warm
You gave my life to me,
Set me free, You set me free.
 
Of all the years I ever knew 
Those final ones I spent with you.

Rferain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I would give everything I own,
Give up my life, my heart, my home.
I would give everything I own,
Just to have you back again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You told  me how to cry, 
I don't know why, just don't know why.
You told those lies to me,
You set me free, you set me free.
 
Of all the years I ever knew
Those final ones I spent with you.

Refrain:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I would give...
...
...
Just to hold you once again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If there's someone you know and won't let you go
And taking it all for granted
And you lose them one day, someone take them away
And you don't hear what they say

Refrain: 2*
---------------------------------------------------------------------
I would give...
---------------------------------------------------------------------
