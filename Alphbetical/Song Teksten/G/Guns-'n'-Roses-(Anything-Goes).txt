I been thinkin' 'bout
thinkin' 'bout sex
always hungry for somethin'
that I haven't had yet
maybe baby you got somethin' to lose
well I got somethin', I got somethin' for you

My way - your way
anything goes tonight
my way - your way
anything goes

Panties 'round your knees
with your ass in debris
doin' dat grind with a push and squeeze
tied up, tied down, up against the wall
be my rubbermade baby
an' we can do it all

my way - your way
anything goes tonight
