Singer : ROGER GLOVER 
Title  : LOVE IS ALL

Everybody's got to live together
All the people got to understand
Love your neighbor like you love your brother
Come on and join the band

All you need is love and understanding
Ring the bell and let the people know
We're so happy and we're celebratin'
Let your feelings show

Love is all, love is all, can't you hear the call
Love is all you need, love is all
You need at the Butterfly Ball

Ain't you happy that we're all together
At the Ball in Nature's countryside
And although we're wearing different faces
Nobody wants to hide

Love is all, and all is love and it's easy
Yes it's so easy
At the Butterfly Ball where love is all
And it's easy

All you need is love and understanding
Ring the bell and let the people know
We're so happy and we're celebratin'
Let your feelings show

Love is all yes love is all at the Butterfly Ball
Love is big love is small love is free and love is all
At the Butterfly Ball

When your back's to the wall
When you're starting to fall
You get something to lean on
Love is everything it can make you sing
At the Butterfly Ball
