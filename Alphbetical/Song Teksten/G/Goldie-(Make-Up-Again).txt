Title  : MAKING UP AGAIN

(Words & music: Dave Black & Pete McDonald)

You, you touch my hand and I sing
You make me feel like a king
That's when I tell you I love you
Oh, you, you don't believe what you see
You take your pain out on me
That's when we say it's all over

Chorus:
We're making up again
After breaking up again
Telling all your friends
We're back as one
Taking off again
Never gonna learn
Telling all your friends
We're back as one

You, you light me up like a flame
I turn you on just the same
That's when you tell me you need me
Would you, you said that I know you're wrong
Making you wait for too long
You said I don't really care

Chorus: ...

Turning your nose up at the man again
If you change your mind give me a sign
It's been a long, long time

Chorus: ...
