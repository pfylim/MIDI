Singer : GUYS & DOLLS 
Title  : MAMACITA

(Words & music: Cynthia Weil/Barry Mann)

She's got a foxy smile, but I better warn ya
She's the straightest lady in the state of California
They raised her by the book and reads on page one
Senoritas, they don't make love for fun
It just ain't done
Let me tell you now

Refrain:
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-cita
She breaks your heart when you see her
So sweet you could eat her
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-cita

I dream about those cherry lips that never've been tasted
And it just tears me apart to think of they've been wasted
She's saving all her love, ain't giving none away
Senoritas, they never shout ole
Till their wedding day
Come on and help me now

Refrain: ...

I'm gonna say 'I do' and when we get it done
We're gonna watch the kids one by one
By one by one by one by one by one
Two three four

Refrain: ...
