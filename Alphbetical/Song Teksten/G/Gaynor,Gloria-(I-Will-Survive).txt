3. I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor

At first I was afraid
I  was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learnt how to get along

And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here
With that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome any more
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with a lie
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Hey hey.

It took all the strength I had
Not to fall apart
And trying hard to mend the pieces
Of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry
But now I hold my head up high
And you see me
Somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person
Still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in
And just expect me to be free
But now I'm saving all my loving
For someone who's loving me

Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome any more
Weren't you the one 
Who tried to break me with your lie
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no not I
I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive
I will survive
Oh
Go on now go
Walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome any more
Weren't you the one 
Who tried to break me with your lie
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
