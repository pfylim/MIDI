There is never a time to say
cos it seems to me we've lost our way
so we carry on, down the road
and we live our lifes haunted by
all the things we say and do 
keep on missing, when I'm alone with you

No there's never a time to change
you don't get a chance to re-arrange
it's a long long way to go
just to find out something, we both know
can't you see what's going on
it's so sad, that a love so strong, has gone

All I know is what is true
all I ask is for you to
Just look around and see

You live your life locked in a dream
where nothing is real, and not what it seems
we can't go on another day
just being afraid to say

It's a long long way to fall
when we both thought wa had it all
well you know it's the time to say
'cos we're all played out, we've lost our way
oh, I'd hooped that you would 
be oh so understanding
and by now you'd see, but oh no
so sad, so sad, that's the way that it goes
I know, I'm gonna tell you right now
