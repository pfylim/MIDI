Been hidin' out
and layin' low
it's nothing new ta time
well you can always find a place to go
if you can keep your sanity
they break down the doors
and they rabe my rights but
they won't touch me
they scream and yell
and fight all night
you can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
they won't touch me
'cause I got somethin'
I been buildin' up inside
for so fuckin' long

Chorus:
They're out ta get me
they won't catch me
I'm innocent
they won't break me

Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'
sometimes it's harder to leave
and everytime you think you know just what you're doin'
that's when your troubles exeed
they push me in a corner
just to get me to fight but
they won't touch me
they preach and yell
and fight all night
you can't tell me
I lose my head
I close my eyes
they won't touch me
'cause I got somethin'
I been buildin' up inside
I'm already gone

Chorus:
Some people got a chip on their shoulder
an some would say it was me
but I didn't buy that fifth of whiskey
that you gave me
so I'd be quick to disagree

Chorus:
They're out ta get me
they won't catch me
I'm innocent
so you can
suck me
take that one to heart.
