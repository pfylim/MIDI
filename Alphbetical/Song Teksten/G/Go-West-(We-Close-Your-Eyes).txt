GO WEST - WE CLOSE OUR EYES

Inside everyone hides one desire outside
No one would know danger close to the edge
Of the knife safer not to let go
And while we miss chances
You can almost hear time slipping away

Refrain:
We close our eyes we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes no time slipping away

No show wednesday girl waits with the wine
She knows just what to say
While no one listens
You can almost hear time slipping away

Refrain:
We close our eyes we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes and we can talk to strangers
We are burning with the spark
And we can walk on water
We are tigers in the dark we are burning

Heroes never give in to the night
He knows how far he can run
And as he surrenders
You can almost hear time slipping away

Refrain:
We close our eyes we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes
We close our eyes we never lose a game
Imagination never lets us take the blame
We close our eyes to see the final frame
We close our eyes
We close our eyes on the water
