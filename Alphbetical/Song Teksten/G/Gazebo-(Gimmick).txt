Gimmick !
G G G G G Gimmick !
I'm gonna get this song to an end
find the right rime on the right time
I'll let the notes rush in through my pen
let the sun rise and I'll feel so fine
you take me by the hand
when you lead me you make me a man
maybe this time we're gonna reach our aim.

A gimmick here
and a gimmick up there
just like a painting rule
but you're there and you dare !
We want a gimmick here
and gimmick up there
we need no school to be aware.

I'm gonna get this song to a start
I'm abitious not pretentious
I'll let my hopes rush in through my heart
but I'm conscious that it's so damn hard
you penetrade my mind
inspiration to make me a man
maybe this time we're gonna reach our aim.

We want a gimmick here
and a gimmick up there
just like a painting rule
but you're there and you dare !
we want a gimmick here
and a gimmick up there
we need no school to be aware
we want a gimmick here and a
and a gimmick up there
just like a painting rulr we dare !
A gimmick here
and a Gimmick up there
we need no school to be aware.

Well Mr. ! This is my demo tape
I hope you like my songs
Oh, yeah 
well you know the problem is that
we must look at what the market is aiming at
you know we need a...

gimmick here
and a gimmick up there.
