Found a head and an arm in da garage can
don't know why I'm here
livin' on the run for oh so long
I gotta go collect
double talkin' jive
get the money mother fucker
'cause I got no more patience
double talkin' 
-I got (lies)-
no more patience man

Back in Town an' a all new friends
they sayin' how ya been ?
fucked up and out of place
that's how I felt back then
double talkin' jive
get the money mother fucker
'cause I got no more patience
double talkin' 
-I got (lies)-
no more patience man
