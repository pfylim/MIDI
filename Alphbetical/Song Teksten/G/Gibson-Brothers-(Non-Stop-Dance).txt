Singer : GIBSON BROTHERS 
Title  : NON STOP DANCE

(Words & music: A. Francfort)

Refrain:
When you've got the feeling
You try to get high
You think you're going insane
And you're almost crazy
Really drives you mad
You feel it coming your way
Have a real good time
Do the dance
Have a real good time
Do the non stop dance

When it's beating and stamping
There's no way out
You're getting drunk by the sound
And you are fooled by the beat around
As you dance by
It really knocks yourself out
Have a real good time
Do the dance
Have a real good time
Do the non stop dance
Have a real good time
Do the non stop dance

Refrain: ...
