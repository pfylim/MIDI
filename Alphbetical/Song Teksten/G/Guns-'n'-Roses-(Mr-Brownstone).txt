I get up around seven
get outta bed around nine
and I don't worry about nothin' no
cause worryin's a waste of my...time

The show usually starts around seven
we go on stage around nine
get on the bus about eleven
sippin' a drink and feelin' fine

Chorus:

We been dancin' with
Mr. Brownstone
He's been knockin'
he won't leave me alone

I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do
so the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better
said a little better than before
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do
so the little got more and more
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better
said a little better than before

Chorus:

Now I get up around whenever
I used ta get up on time
but that old man he's a real muthafucker
gonna kick him on down the line.
se we both know money burns
honey don't stop tryin
