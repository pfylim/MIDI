I can't stop thinkin'
thinking 'bout sinkin'
sinkin' down into my bed
I call my mother
she's just a cunt now
she said I'm sick in the head
she said you ain't special
so who you foolin'
don't try to give me a line
but I can't stop thinkin' 'bout seein' ya
one more time
(Oh no)
but I already left you
and you're better off left behind

It's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind
it's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind

Too bad you're fucked up

I used to be wasted
always tried to take it
take it down into my vein
I call the doctor
he's just another
he said I'm thick in the brain
he said you ain't special
so who you foolin'
don't try to give me a line
but I can't stop thinking 'bout doin' it
one more time
(Oh no)
but I already left you
and you're better off left behind
(Oh yeah)

Aw it's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind
it's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind

So bad.....

Boy

It's a
it's a
Heads up
It's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind
now it's a bad obsession
it's always messin'
it's always messin' my mind

But I can't stop thinking 'bout doin' it
one more time
(Oh no)
see I already left you
and you're better off left behind
(Oh no, oh no)
it's a bad obsession
and you're always messin' my mind
see I already left you
and you're better off left behind
uh huh...no

Maybe you'll do better next time punk !!
