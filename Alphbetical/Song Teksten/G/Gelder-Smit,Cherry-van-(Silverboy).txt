Singer : CHERRIE VAN GELDER-SMIT 
Title  : SILVERBOY

I've been told by the other girls
When you're travelling with your band
You're dressed up all in silver
When you're singing for your fans

Running round through the flashing lights
All your life now is just a show
I try to write and tell you
There are some things I want you to know

Refrain:
Silver boy, silver boy
Up on stage you're like a little boy
Shining toy, silver boy
Please come back again and bring me joy

Dancing round in your shiny clothes
Makes you loved by all the girls
From Rio to Chicago
You're their image of a dreamful world
Keep on shining till your fans have gone
When you need a place to rest
Then may be you'll remember
I'm the girl who loved you the best

Refrain: ...

If you come back to my place
I won't feel so lonely
You can be sure of a place to stay
So rest for a while
Let me see your smile
Stay just for a little while

Refrain: ...
