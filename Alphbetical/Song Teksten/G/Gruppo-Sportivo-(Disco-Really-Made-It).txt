Today it's flat coke and unga unga disco

I don't know why I fall asleep
It must be that disco beat
You know rock'n'roll is over now
Today it's flat coke and unga unga disco

Disco really made it, it's empty and I hate it
Top ten radio hello disco goodbye
Rock'n'roll it's all over now
Ooh, I should have known

That's it, ride on, let's go to Hollywood
No bikes, do dikes, no wooden shoes

Chorus: ...
