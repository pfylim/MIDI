When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
but darlin' when I hold you
don't you know I feel the same

'Cause nothin' lasts forever
and we both know hearts can change
and it's hard to hold a candle
in the cold November rain

We've been through this such a long time
just tryin' to kill tha pain

But lovers always come
and lovers always go
an no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
walking away

If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
just knowin' that you were mine
all mine
so if you want to love me
then darlin' don't refrain
or I'll just end up walkin' 
in the cold November rain

Do you need some time...on your own
do you need some time...all alone
everybody needs some time...on their own
don't you know you need some time...all alone

I know it's hard to keep an open heart
when even friends seem out to harm you
but if you could heal a broken heart
wouldn't time be out to charm you

Sometimes I need some time...on my own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
everybody needs some time...on their own
don't you know you need some time...all alone


And when your fears subside
and shadows still remain
I know that you can love me
when there's no one left to blame
so never mind the darkness
we still can find a way
'cause nothin' lasts forever
even cold November rain

Don't ya think that you need somebody
don't ya think that you need someone
everybody needs somebody
you're not the only one
you're not the only one.
 mind the darkness
we still can find a way
'cause nothin' lasts forever
even cold November rain
