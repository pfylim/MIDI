EDDY GRANT - GIMME HOPE JO'ANNA

Well Jo'anna she runs a country
She runs in Durban and the Transvaal
She makes a few of her people happy oh
She don't care about the rest at all

She got a system they call apartheid
It keeps a brother in a subjection
But maybe pressure will make Jo'anna see
How everybody could live as one oh

Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna 'for the mourning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Hope before the mourning come

I hear she makes all the golden money
To buy new weapons in the shape of guns
While every mother in a black Soweto
Fears the killing of another son

Sneakin' across all the neighbours' borders
Now and again having a little fun
She doesn't care if the fun and games she play
Is dangerous to everyone oh

Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna 'for the mourning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Hope before the mourning come

She got supporters in high up places
Who turn their heads to the city sun
Jo'anna give them the fancy money oh
To tempt anyone who'd come

She even knows how to swing opinion
In every magazine and the journals
For every bad move that this Jo'anna make
They got a good explanation oh

Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna 'for the mourning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Hope before the mourning come

Even the preacher who works for Jesus
The Archbishop who's a peaceful man
Together say that the freedom fighters will
Overcome the very strong

I wanna know if you're blind Jo'anna
If you wanna hear the sound of drum
Can't you see that the tide is turning oh
Don't make me wait till the mourning come oh

Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Gimme hope Jo'anna 'for the mourning come
Gimme hope Jo'anna hope Jo'anna
Hope before the mourning come
