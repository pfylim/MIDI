Singer : PATSY GALLANT 
Title  : FROM NEW YORK TO L.A.

(Words & music: Vignault/Williams)

In my mind there's a face
On my lips there's a name
In my life there's no place
For the man that I love
'Cause I'm living my life
Just to sing and be free
From L.A. to New York
From New York to L.A.
From New York to L.A.
Ooh oh ooh ooh
From New York to L.A.
From New York to L.A.
From New York to L.A.

Chorus:
I'm a star in New York
I'm a star in L.A.
In my life there's no place
For the man that I love
'Cause I'm living my life
Just to sing and be free
From L.A. to New York
From New York to L.A.
From New York to L.A.

The city life of flashing lights
Busy streets and fancy cars
With boose and drugs in all the clubs
Everyone is a shining star
Was so inviting to my eyes
That I can only be surprised
By all sound and sights to see
I thought all this was really meant for me
But was it really meant for me

Chorus: ...

The city lights are often blurred
By the stories we've already heard
The boose and drugs now break my head
'Cause all the shining stars are dead
I sometimes close my tired eyes
To let myself be hypnotized 
By memories of loving you
The man I thought was meant for me
But were you really meant for me

Chorus: ...
