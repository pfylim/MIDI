3. As Time Goes By - Max Greger

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply, as time goes by

And when two lovers woo
They still say "I love you"
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings, as time goes by

Moolight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
