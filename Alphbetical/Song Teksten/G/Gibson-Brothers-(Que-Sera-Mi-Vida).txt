Singer : GIBSON BROTHERS
Title  : QUE SERA MI VIDA?

(Words & music: ?)

Chorus:
Que sera, mi vida
How I'm gonna live without your love?
If you ever should go
Que sera, mi vida
How I'm gonna find my way alone
If ever you should go

How can I know what I would do
If I was really losing you
When it isn't true (When it isn't true)

How can I know how I'd react
Before I have to face the fact
Of a broken heart

Chorus: ...

How can I see you miles away
I know too well you gonna stay
Every night and day
You never know just what you've got
You only feel it means a lot
When it's gone and lost

If you should go

Chorus: ...

So if you really want to see
The way my life is gonna be
If you leavin' me, if you leavin' me
Just walk away and close the door
And don't come back at least before
Seven weeks or more

If you should go

Chorus: ...
