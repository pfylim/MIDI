Singer : GOLDEN EARRING 
Title  : BOMBAY

(Words & music: Barry Hay/George Kooijmans)

Bombay seems lost in dreams
When the pipes let off steam
In a back room
Somewhere, anywhere in L.A.

Next payday comes, I'll be gone
By boats and planes, it's pre-arranged
You can't catch me, I'm on my way
Back to Bombay

Bombay
Ain't gonna leave no trace
Gonna wash away my face
In the Bombay river
I'm gonna settle
I'm gonna stay in Bombay

I'm gonna trade my past
For a new life at last
Sit back and have another blast
If I die, Kamasutra's the reason why
Kamasutra I surrender
