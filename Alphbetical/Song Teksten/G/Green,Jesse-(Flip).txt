What can I tell you, to make you see
Just what you're doing, what you're doing to me
If you don't get it, then I'll explain
You know you're driving, driving me insane

Am gonna flip, hip
Lose my grip, hip, hip
Am gonna slip, hip
Am take a trip, hip, hip

I tell you baby, my sweet love child
The things you're doing, really drive me wild
You've kept me waiting, for too much time
Can't hold much longer, babe I'll lose my mind

Am gonna flip, hip
Lose my grip, hip, hip
Am gonna slip, hip
Am take a trip, hip, hip

Listen baby, don't keep me hanging on
I've been waiting far too long
To love you, oh come on

Am gonna flip, hip
Lose my grip, hip, hip
Am gonna slip, hip
Am take a trip, hip, hip
