Title  : LONG BLOND ANIMAL
Artist : GOLDEN EARRING

(Words & music: George Kooyman/Barry Hay)

Get out of my parlour, won't you
Get out of my life
Put on that crazy raincoat
You're gonna need it tonight
Get out of my parlour
For I cut you with a knife
Don't want your disease
Don't need your silly jive

Chorus:
I was an innocent by-stander
I was middle of the roadman for you
Then you took me for a ride, now baby
Showed me all the things you could do
I always listen to the good looking lady
A mistake I won't make no more
'Cause you might be a goodlooking lady
You're rotten to the core

I've been under your influence
Under your spell too long
Now people keep me at a distance
Everything I do is wrong
My brain's desintegrating
Devils singing my song
This cannot continue
This cannot go on

Chorus: ...

You're nothing but a long blond animal
