I been lookin' for a trace
lookin' for a heart
lookin' for a lover in a world that's much too dark
you don't want my love
you want satisfaction
you don't need my love
you gotta find yourself another
piece of the action, yeah

Said where you goin'
what you gonna do
I been lookin' evrywhere
I been lookin' for you

You don't want my love
you want satisfaction
you don't need my love
you gotta find yourself another
piece of the action
'cause you're crazy
you're fuckin' crazy
ya know you're crazy
I said you're crazy

Say boy where ya comin' from
where'd ya get that point of view
when I was younger
said I knew someone like you
and they said
You don't want my love
you want satisfaction
you don't need my love
you gotta find yourself another
piece of the action
'cause you're crazy
you're fuckin' crazy
ya know you're crazy
I said you're crazy
ooh you're crazy
you know you're crazy
well you're crazy
you know you're crazy

You know you are
bring it down
you're fuckin' crazy.
