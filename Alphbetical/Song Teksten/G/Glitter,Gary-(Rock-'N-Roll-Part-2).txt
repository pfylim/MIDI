Rock & Roll, Rock, Rock & Roll , Rock....

Can you still recall in the jukebox hall
When the music played
And the world span round to a brand new sound those far off days
And the blue suede shoes thy were screamin' "shout"
And the same old blues, let it all hang out
Rock & Roll, Rock & Roll....

Little Queenie, hop, let the eyes go up
Dancing to the beat
With the U.S. mail and a pony tail
When (well) she looks so sweet
Time is changin' fast
Though the ages pass
They'll be rockin' yeah

Rock & Roll, Rock & Roll ,....
