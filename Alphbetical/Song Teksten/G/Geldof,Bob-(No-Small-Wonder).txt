I got home last night about 8
there was nothing one the T.V. as usual
just the normal repeats and things
I had the City Price edition of the Evening Standard
which is not as good as the Late Night one
mainly because it doesn't have the full cinema listings
to be more specifc it doesn't have the Fulham ABC
which is my local
so I walked over to Battersea Park
down by the Sri Chimnoy Mile
past the Peace Pagoda
it's good
you can have a personal religious experience
and get healthy at the same time
which obviously is important for a busy man like me
well another moment in life's great adventure
it's no small wonder

I hope you weren't offended by what happened last night
it was the awkward hour
and I didn't know what to do
whether to come on or just leave it
to be honest I wasn't that interested
and I didn't think you were either
so I went back to my place
and you went back to yours
and I got innto bed
and started reading a book
by a guy called Tobias Woolf
it's good it's short stories
just before you sleep he'll take
you off Burma ... Mandalay
places like that
I set the alarm clock ready for another day at work
another day in life's great adventure
it's no small wonderr
