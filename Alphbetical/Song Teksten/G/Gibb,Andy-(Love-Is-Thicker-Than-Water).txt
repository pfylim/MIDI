Singer : ANDY GIBB 
Title  : LOVE IS THICKER THAN WATER

(Words & music: Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb)

Chorus: 
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dream, is only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

Save my mind, should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

Chorus: ...

Save my fall, should I find her, she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow
But I can't leave her
While I need her more than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for
