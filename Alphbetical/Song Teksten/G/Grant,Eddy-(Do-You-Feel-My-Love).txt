Title  : DO YOU FEEL MY LOVE
Artist : EDDY GRANT

(Words & music: Eddy Grant)

You left me a problem
Now I know what it's all about
You took my heart and split up
Now you know what it's all about

Chorus:
Do you feel my love
Don't you feel it as I walk away
Do you feel my love
Don't you feel it as I walk away

Who knows what kind of pitiful excuse
You find yourself
To justify the misery
That you put yourself within

Chorus: ...

Need to find myself
All that I've got left
Used up on I'm used up
Need to cry but still got to show my will
Been used too much

Chorus: ...

Need to find myself
All that I've got left
Used up oh I'm used up
Need to cry but still got to show my iwll
Been used too much

Chorus: ...
