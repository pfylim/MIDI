Title  : The Great Song Of Indefferrence
Singer : Bob Geldof


I don't mind if you go
I don't mind if you take it slow
I don't mind if you say yes or no
I don't mind at all
I don't care if you live or die
Couldn't care less if you laugh or cry
I don't mind if you crash or fly
I don't mind at all
I don't mind if you come or go
I don't mind if you say no
Couldn't care less baby let it flow
'Cause I don't care at all
Na na na etc.

I don't care if you sink or swim
Lock me out or let me in
Where I'm going or where I've been
I don't mind at all
I don't mind if the government falls
Implements more futile laws
I don't care if the nation stalls
And I don't care at all
I don't care if they tear down trees
I don't feel the hotter breeze
Sink in dust in dying seas
And I don't care at all
Na na na etc.

I don't mind if culture crumbles
I don't mind if religion stumbles
I can't hear the speakers mumble
And I don't mind at all
I don't care if the Third World fries
It's hotter there I'm not surprised
Baby I can watch whole nations die
And I don't care at all
I don't mind (6x)
I don't mind at all
Na na na etc.

I don't mind about people's fears
Authority no longer hears
Send a social engineer
And I don't mind at all
