Yesterday there was so many things
I was never told
now that I'm startin' to learn
I feel I'm growin' old

'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
old pictures that I'll always see
time just fades the pages
in my book of memories
prayers in my pocket
and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along
with no time to plant my feet

'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me
old pictures that I'll always see
some things could be better
if we'd all just let them be

Yesterday's got nothin' for me
yesterday's got nothin' for me
got nothin' for me

Yesterday there was so many things
I was never told
suddenly this time I found
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone

Yesterday's got nothin' for me
old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties

Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday's got nothin' for me
Yesterday

Yesterday
