Singer : GARY GLITTER
Title  : REMEMBER ME THIS WAY

I can't conceal the way I feel
It's time for me to go
Don't ask me why don't ever try
To stop me as I go
I'll be back somewhere someway
Don't feel alone
One fine day you'll hear me say
Darling I'm home

A tear that falls a voice that calls
Is all I left to you
A last goodbye the tears I cry
I dedicate to you
I'll just go on missing you
So until then
I'll just dream of kissing you
Again and again

Refrain:
I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
When you dream of me each night
Remember me this way
I will love you all my life
In my special way
In the stillness of the night
Remember me this way
