Title  : COME TO AMERICA

(Words & music: A. Francfort)

America, America, America, oh
If you really wanna get
Some good times and happiness
If you really wanna see
Funky people dancing free
If you really wanna feel
Something good and something real
Come to America, America

If you really wanna fly
Like a jet up in the sky
If you really wanna dance
Come on baby, you've got a chance
If you really wanna feel
Something good and something real
Come to America, come to America
Come to America, America, America, America
Oh if you really feeling down
Get yourself together now
If you really wanna dance
Come on baby, you've got the chance
If you really wanna feel 
Something good and something real
Come to America, America
Come to America, oh America
Come to America
