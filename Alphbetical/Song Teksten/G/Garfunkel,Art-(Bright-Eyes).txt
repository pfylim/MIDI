Title  : BRIGHT EYES

(Words & music: Mike Batt)

Is it a kind of dream
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream
Oh is it a dream

There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
Out nobody seems to know where you go
And what does it mean
Oh is it a dream

Bright eyes, how can you close and fail
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale
Bright eyes

Reaching into the night
Wondering over the hills and stream
High wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows

Chorus: ...
