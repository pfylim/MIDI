I'll take a nicotine, caffeine, sugar fix
Jesus don't ya git tired of turnin' tricks
but when your innocence dies
you'll find the blues
seems all our heroes were born to lose
just walkin' through time
you believe this heat
another empty house another dead end street
gonna rest my bones an sit for a spell
this side of heaven this close to hell

Right next door to hell
why don't you write a letter to me yeah
I said I'm right next door to hell
an so many eyes are on me
right next door to hell
I got nowhere else to be
right next door to hell
feels like the walls are closing in on me

My mama never really said much to me
she was much too young and scared ta be
hell "Freud" might say that's what I need
but all I really ever get is greed
an most my friends they feel the same
hell we don't even have ourselves to blame
but times are hard and thrills are cheaper
as your arms get shorter
your pockets get deeper

Right next door to hell
why don't you write a letter to me 
I said I'm right next door to hell
an so many eyes are on me
right next door to hell
I never thought this is where I'd be
but I'm right next door to hell
thinkin' time'll stand still for me

Fuck you
Bitch

Not bad kids just stupid ones
yeah thought we'd own the world
an gettin' used was havin' fun
I said we're not sad kids just lucid ones eah
flowin' through life not collectin' anyone
so much out there
still so much to see
time's too much to handle
time's too much for me
it drives me up the walls
drives me out of my mind
can you tell me what this means...huh ?
