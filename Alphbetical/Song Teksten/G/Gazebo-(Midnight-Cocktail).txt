Well I was ramblin' down through the streets
with my Rolls-Royce
when I came in that bar in 5th Avenue
well this beautiful Lady came up to me
and she said:
Hey ma ! Do you wanna drink something ? 
I said:
Yeah, well what do you have ?
She said:
We have some beautiful cocktails
which can really freak you out. She said.
God I wish you could just let me know
'cause your eyes don't want to show.
God I wish you could just let me know
I don't think I'll let you go.

Well it's just a midnight cocktail
well it's just a midnight cocktail
and I feel like you
a Vodka-Lemon ? Or do you want a Bloody Mary ? She said.
Hey man, I want a Manhattan, touch me now
Noo ! I think I'll have a Tequila Sunrise
or a screwdriver, a Jack Daniels
hey do you have any Shampain.
Champagne ! You mean ?
Shampain. She said.

I like you when you move.
God I like the way you make the groove
though your eyes they show some Blues
God I like the sweetness in your moods
and I think you always knew.

Well it's just a midnight cocktail
well it's just a midnight cocktail
and I'm in love with you
well, this thing ended up in a L.A. hotel room
we took room no. 6129 which is on the right wing
of the hotel. She was there on the bed and she said:
Hey is that what you really want ?
Or do you just want a Gin & Tonic ? I said:
I want an Alexander. Actually I want you
yeah well you know, I want you
it might seem strange, really strange, I said.
