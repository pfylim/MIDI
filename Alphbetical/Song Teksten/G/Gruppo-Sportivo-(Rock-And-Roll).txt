(Words & music: Van de Fruits)

When my guitar goes ah ah ah
And the drums go boom boom boom
Is it punk, new wave or rock and roll?
Tell me girls, it's up to you

Ah ah ah
Rock'n'roll

I guess you're right
This is rock and roll
Little girl, you got to be mine
I like the way you say those words
I think I wanna hear it one more time

Rock'n'roll (3x)

When my guitar goes ah ah ah
And the drums go boom boom boom
And the bass goes do do do do
I don't care if it's punk or rock'n'roll to you

Never mind your funky socks
I wanna smell them all night long
Ka-ka-ka-keep on dancin'
'Cause you know the beat goes on

Rock'n'roll (3x)

When my guitar goes ah ah ah
And the drums go boom boom boom etc.

Guess you're right etc.

Rock'n'roll (10x)
