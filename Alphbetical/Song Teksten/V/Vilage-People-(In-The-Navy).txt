Singer : VILLAGE PEOPLE 
Title  : IN THE NAVY

(Words & music: J. Morali/H. Belolo/V. Willes)

Where can you find pleasure
Search the world for treasure
Learn science technology
Where can you begin to make 
Your dreams all come true
On the land and on the sea
Where can you learn to try
Play sports or skindive
Study oceanography
Sign up for the big band
Or sit in the grand stand
When your team and others meet

Chorus:
In the navy, yes you can sail the seven seas
In the navy, yes you can put your mind at ease
In the navy, come on now people make a stand
In the navy, can't you see we need a hand
In the navy, come on protect the motherland
In the navy, come on and join your fellow man
In the navy, come on people make a stand
In the navy, in the navy
They want you, they want you
They want you as a new recruit

If you like adventure don't wait to enter
The recruiting office fast
Don't you hesitate
There is no need to wait
They're signing up new seamen fast
Maybe you are too young to join up today but
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
For I'm sure there will be always the good navy
Protecting the land and sea

Chorus: ...

But I'm afraid of water

Hey, hey look man
I get seasick even watching it on the t.v.

They want you
Oh my goodness
They want you
What am I gonna do in a submarine
They want you
They want you
In the navy

Chorus: ...
