Singer : VILLAGE PEOPLE 
Title  : GO WEST

(Words & music: J. Morali/H. Belolo/V. Willis)

Together we will go our way
Together we will leave some day
Together, your hand in my hand
Together we will make the plans
Together we will fly so high
Together, tell our friends goodbye
Together we will start life new
Together, this is what we'll do
Go west, life is peaceful there, go west
Lost of open air, go west to begin life new
Go west, this is what we'll do, go west
Sun in wintertime, go west, we will do just fine
Go west where the skies are blue
Go west, this and more we'll do too
More we'll do, go west

Together we will love the beach
Together we will learn and teach
Together change our place of life
Together we will work and strive
I love you, I know you love me
I want you happy and carefree
So that's why I have no protest
When you say you want to go west

I know that there are many ways
To live there in the sun or shade
Together we will find a place
To settle down and live with space
Without the bust, pace back east
The hustling, rustling of the feet
I know I'm ready to leave too
So this is what we're going to do
