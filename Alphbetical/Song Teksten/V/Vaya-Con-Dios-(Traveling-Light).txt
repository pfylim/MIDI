Title  : Travelling Light
Singer : Vaya Con Dios


Come on handsome
Put a quarter in that thing again
It don't matter
If the song is the same
Pull me closer
You and I have nothing to explain
Storm is threatening
Shelter a while from the rain

Chorus:
'Cos tonight the wind is blowin'
And the sea is running high
All your troubles little darling
Let them drift with the tide
There's a full moon above us
Shining out so bright
Why worry about tomorrow ?
You're young and you're travelling light

Come on sailor
Put a quarter in that thing again
It don't matter
If it's always the same
Hold me closer
You and I may never meet again
Maybe somewhere
Down old memory lane

Chorus


Words & Music : D. Schoufs, D. Klein
