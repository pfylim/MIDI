Title  : WHAT KIND OF DANCE IS THIS

(Words & music: Janschen & Janschens, e.v.a.)

Dance now, boogie now, dance

Refrain:
What kind of dance is this
All night long
What kind of song is this
Turning me on
Making those light go
On and out, out, on and out
Again, it keeps me going on

Refrain: ...

Do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Do you, do you, do you wanna dance
Oh baby, do you wanna dance

And when they start to play that favorite song
I feel like dancing all night long
(Dance the night away)
What kind of dance is this, oh
All night long

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog ...

Let me in whee ooh ....

And when they start to play that favorite song
I feel like dancing all night long
(Dance the night away)

Hey mr. Tambourine Man play a song for me...

Refrain: ...

What kind of song is this
