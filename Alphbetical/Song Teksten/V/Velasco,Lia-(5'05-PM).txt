Title  : 5:05 PM

Five o five, another friday night
Five o five, can't stop that feeling inside
Funky evening just begun
All the night we're having fun

Have a party at the disco show
Dance and romance to be found
That's the place where I wanna go
Swinging around and around

Five o five, let's dance the night away
Five o five, I know today is the day
Funky evening is the start
Of a new romance with the man in my heart

Have a party at the disco show
Dance and romance to be found
That's the place where I wanna go
Swinging around and around

Disco, disco, disco

Have a party at the disco show
Dance and romance to be found
That's the place where I wanna go
Swinging around and around

Five o five, another friday night
Five o five, can't stop that feeling inside
Funky evening just begun
All the night we're having fun

Five o five, let's dance the night away
Five o five, I know today is the day
Funky evening is the start
Of a new romance with the man in my heart
