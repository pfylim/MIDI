Title  : YOUR SMILE

(Words & music: A.Mol/G.J.Hessing/J.Flint/E.v.Prehn/
E.Veerhoff/C.Bergman)

Cold winter's day
And I pray
That I could see you now
I need your love so very bad

You make me warm
When your arms surround me tenderly
I see that sunshine in your eyes

Refrain:
(Only you) stole my heart away
(Yeah you) brighten up my day
(Only you) can ease my pain
Smile, show me your smile
I can't live without your smile
Show me your smile

Take me for real
What I feel
Is much more than you know
Please show
Your love to me

Refrain: ...2x...
