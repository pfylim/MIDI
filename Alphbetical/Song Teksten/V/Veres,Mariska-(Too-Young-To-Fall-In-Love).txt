Title  : TOO YOUNG TO FALL IN LOVE

(Words & music: Robbie van Leeuwen)

You gave me a world I have never seen before
Makes me crying out for more
But you are so illusive, you are so illusive
I feel that deep down in my heart
You're too young to fall in love
You're too young to fall in love

Wild is your love and I love it so
Can't resist all my feelings
Which are tempting my soul
But you are so illusive, you're so illusive
I feel that deep down in my heart
You're too young to fall in love
You're too young to fall in love

Your beauty is so young and bright
To keep you in my arms is heavens delight
Why can't this be reality
