Title  : SHOULD I BE LONELY

What would I be when I shouldn't have you
And what would I miss when I shouldn't have you
There'd be no fights with you
And there'd be no nights with you
But should I be lonely when I'd be alone

Should I be different without you to care
And should I come home when you shouldn't be there
Now I would cry for you
And even die for you
But should I be lonely when I'd be alone

But without you I shouldn't have them
To work for as hard as I can
And without you I would not see
The love you feel for me
And without you I wouldn't have you

And no one to join me when I'm feeling glad
And no one to help when I'm feeling sad
No one to cry for me
And no one to die for me
Yes I would be lonely
When I'd be alone
