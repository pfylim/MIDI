Title  : What's a Woman ?
Singer : Vaya Con Dios


What's a woman when a man
Don't stand by her side?
What's a woman when a man
Has secrets to hide?
She'll be weak, she'll be strong
Struggle hard, for so long
What's a woman when a man
(What's a man without a woman?)
Don't go by the rule
What's a woman when a man
(What's a man without a woman?)
Makes her feel like a fool?
When right turns to wrong
She will try to hold on
To the ghosts if the past
When love was to last
Dreams from the past
Faded so fast
All alone in the dark
She will swear
He'll never mislead her again
All those dreams from the past
When love was to last
All alone in the dark
She will swear cross her heart
Never again
Cross my heart, never again.
