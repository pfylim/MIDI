MILLI VANILLI - I'M GONNA MISS YOU

(Words & music: Milli Vanilli)

I knew it from the start
You would break my heart
But still I had to play this painful part
You wrapped me 'round your finger
With your magic smile
You kept me hangin' on a lovers cross a while

You put your spell on me
Took my breath away
But there was nothin' I could do
To make you stay
I'm gonna miss you

All the love I feel for you
Nothing could make me change
My point of view
Oh baby, I'm gonna miss you baby

It's a tragedy for me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you

Like a honey bee
You took the best of me
Now I can't erase these memories
Like a fairy tale
You were so unreal
You left a scar that's so hard to heal
When you had a taste of paradise
Back on earth can't feel
As cold as ice
I'm gonna miss you

Givin' all the love I feel for you
Couldn't make you change your point of view
You're leavin'
Now I'm sittin' here, I'm wastin' my time
I just don't know what I should do

It's a tragedy to me
To see the dream is over
And I never will forget the day we met
Girl I'm gonna miss you
