Oh Donna oh Donna oh Donna oh Donna

Refrain

I had a girl and Donna was her name
since she left me I've never been the same
cause I love my girl Donna oh where can you be
where can you be
now that you're gone I'm all alone
all by myself to wonder and moan
cause I love my girl Donna oh where can you be
where can you be


Oh well darling now that you're gone
I don't know  what I do cause I had all my love
for I need you

Refrain

I had a girl ...


Oh Donna oh Donna oh Donna oh Donna
