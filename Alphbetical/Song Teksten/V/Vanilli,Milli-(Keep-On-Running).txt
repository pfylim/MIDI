Elaborate on the microphone

'cos my brain ain't stoned
at last not in ignorance
Contempt or arrongance
i started 82 and i'm fresh ever since

about what's happening

is really not relevant
wake up back to really i'm not into bragging
strutting or bigottry
i get this you will get diesed
my sister ain't get nothing
unless the woman was pissed
the material thing is what people
are looking for they want more and more
i tell the truth 'cos the time is that
but take it light my brother
beez like dat listen to what he says oh oh oh

--------------------------------------------------------
Keep on running baby uh uh uh

come on be honest today brothers and sisters
aliens or white girl believe in yourself
so we can make this a nice world
for us to live in so start to give in
peace and love hurry up
the clock is ticking i tell the truth
'cos the time is that
but take it light my brother breez like dat listen to what he says oh
