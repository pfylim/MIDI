VANESSA - DON'T PULL THE TRIGGER ON ME

Refrain:
Don't pull the trigger on me
Oh no, I'm not a sinner you see
I'm not trying to make you bleed
Baby, don't pull the trigger on me
Don't pull the trigger on me
Baby, I'm not intending to be
Someone who loves you and leaves
So don't pull the trigger on me

Can't you tell now, you're making hell now
And there's no reason for playing games
Don't wanna fight you, let me excite you
The way it used to be could be the same
But you get crazy
You just amaze me
Can't you see it, you're not wiser then before

Refrain: ...

You're like a stranger, a threatening danger
Why don't you slow down and listen to me
This is so helpless
But you won't let us try and talk it out
And maybe we'll see
If there's some magic instead of tragic
But then perhaps you're no wiser than before

Refrain: ...
