Title  : GET UP
Artist : MARIA VERANO

(Words & music: J. Zwart/P. Sch”n)

Chorus 1:
Getting kind of crazy
Seeing all the people going round

Never feeling lazy
Giving up the beat into the ground

The're really looking good
Dressed up like they should
While the music takes me high
Get up, get up, get up, get up

Chorus 2:
No one seems to worry
Leaving all the troubles far behind
(Come on baby yeah)
There's no time to lay back 
Gotta keep the music on your mind
You're really looking good
Dressed up like you should
While the music takes you high
Get up, get up, get up, get up


Chorus 2: ...

Chorus 1: ...

Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
