I BOUGHT MYSELF A PERCOLATOR
JUST TO KEEP MY COFFEE HOT
I DIDN'T HAVE A PERCOLATOR
I DIDN'T HAVE A COFFEE-POT

MY CHICKS ARE WANTING' ME TO DATE HER
I SHOULD BE READY BUT I'M NOT
I HAVE TO WAIT'N LATE AND LATER
I'VE GOT TO HEAT MY COFFEE-POT

KEEP A PERCIN PERCOLATOR
COME ON AND GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT
KEEP A PERCIN PERCOLATOR
YOU GOT TO KEEP MY COFFEE HOT

SOLO

I WOULDN'T HAVE AN ACROVATOR
CAUSE SHE IS REALLY ALL I GOT
BROTHER YOU THINK TO SHOP AND WAIT HER
AND I LIKE HER QUITE A LOT

AND NOW I LIKE TO SEPARATE HER
BUT I AM JUST A COFFEESOT
WHEN WE'RE MARRIED SOME DAY LATER
WE'LL PUT IT IN A COFFEE SHOP

KEEP A PERCIN PERCOLATOR
COME ON AND GIVE IT ALL YOU GOT
KEEP A PERCIN PERCOLATOR
YOU GOT TO KEEP MY COFFEE HOT
