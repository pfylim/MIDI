BYE BYE BLUEBIRD


Bye bye bluebird Bye bye bluebird
You were lots of fun toknow
But I have to let you go

Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 
You're the flyin' saucer kind
In and out and hard to find
Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 

When you came I flipped my lid
I never thought I'd lose you kid
Though we were a perfect pair
It was a flight-by-night affair

Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 

Oh I should have clipped your wings
I'm not gonna do these things
Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 
If you ever should be near
Don't forget to drop in here
Bye bye bluebird 
Bye bye bluebird 

Call me when you short of dough
Or maybe just to say hallo
No hard feelings anyway
It's nice to know we had our day

Bye bye bluebird...4x


they haunt me
I wish
You were so close to me
Yes I wish you were
By my side
