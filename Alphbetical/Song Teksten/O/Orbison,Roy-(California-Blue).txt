
    California Blue         Roy Orbison


Working all day - and the sun don't shine
Trying to get by - and I'm just killing time.
I feel the rain - fall the whole night through
Far away from you - California Blue.

California Blue - dreaming all alone
Nothing else to do - California Blue.
Everyday I pray - I'll be on my way
Saving love for you - California Blue.

One sunny day - I'll get back again.
Somehow, someway - but I don't know when.
California Blue, California Blue.

Living my life - with you an my mind.
Thinking of things - that I left far behind.
It's been so long -Doin' all I can do,
To get back to you - California Blue.

Refrain

Fine sunny day - I'll get back again.
Somehow, someway - but I don't know when.
California Blue - California Blue.
Still missing you - California Blue
Still missing you - California Blue
Still missing you - California Blue
