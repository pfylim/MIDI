Singer : DONNY OSMOND
Title  : YOUNG LOVE

They say for ev'ry boy and girl
there's just one love in this whole world
and I know I've found mine
The heavenly touch of your embrace
tells me no one can take your place
ever in my heart

Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion

Just one kiss from your sweet lips
will tell me that your love is real
And I can feel that it's true
We will vow to one another
there will never be another
love for you or for me

Young love, our love
We share with deep emotion
