Now it is
It's the Outhere Brothers
Back in the room
Ready to rock the world with the boom
So I hope you can stand the vibration
'Cause we're about to rock the entire nation
All right? Here we go.
I say  boom, boom, boom,
Now let me hear you say wheaooo... wheaooo
I say  boom, boom, boom,
Now what about to say wheaooo... wheaooo (2 v.)
Girl, your fooleries  go round
I just want to let you down
Let me take you from behind
I won't come until it's time
Oh, if I cannot sleep wth you
Maybe I could have a taste
Put your nunny on my tongue
And your boodie on my face.
I came to make you shake it, till you brak it
Caress your body until you're naked
Brings you over, grab your shoulder
Slip my peter inside your folder
Make me sweater, get you wetter
Pumping faster to make you better
Turn the lights then lock the room
'Cause now it's time for me to hit that boom
Boom, boom, boom,
Now let me hear you say wheaoo... wheaoo
I say boom, boom, boom
Now what about to say wheaoo... wheaoo
I say boom, boom, boom
Now let me hear you say wheaoo... wheaoo
I say boom, boom, boom
Now what about to say wheaoo... wheaoo
Girl, your fooleries  go round
I just want to let you down
Let me take you from behind
I won't come until it's time
If I cannot sleep with you
Maybe I could have a taste
Put your "nunny" on my tongue
And your "boodie" on my face
Uh, Uh, don't you run'em all
Look out below
Here comes the brother
With the old pit-fall
I just fell from the mothership
Outhere Brothers' about to rip it on another tip
Slip, don't trip, check a dabadooe
My knickers in the house until your body gets the fluid
As I come from the devils of doom
I step back latch pow with a boom
Boom, boom, boom,
Now let me hear you say wheaoo... wheaoo
I say boom, boom, boom,
Now what about to say wheaoo... wheaoo (2 v.)
Let me hear you say wheaoo (4 v.)
Ah I came to make you shake it till you break it
Caress your body until you're naked
Brings you over, grab your shoulder
Slip my peter inside your folder
Make you sweater, get you wetter
Pumping faster to make you better
Turn the lights then lock the room
'Cause now it's time for me to hit that boom
Boom, boom, boom
Now let me hear you say wheaoo... wheaoo
I say boom, boom, boom,
Now what about to say wheaoo... wheaoo (2 v.)
