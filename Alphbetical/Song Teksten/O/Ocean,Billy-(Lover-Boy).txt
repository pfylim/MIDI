BILLY OCEAN - LOVER BOY

I don't know what you've got but it plays with
my emotions makes me want you so much
Darling I want to hold you near want to whisper
sweet and tender in your ear
Can't stand the thought of you with somebody else
Got to have your love got to have it all to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Refrain:
Wanna be your lover lover
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy
Lover lover
Wanna be your lover lover lover boy

Too far gone it's hard to stop
Baby you're my dream in motion and I won't give up
Teasing me with your fire
My finger's on the trigger
Your the one I desire
'Cause I have this feeling from nobody else
Got to have your tenderness all to myself
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah

Refrain: ...

And I want you really but the thing is there's
nothing I can say
To stop you darling from running away
Won't you stay stay stay yeah

I wanna be your love
Gotta have your love
Gonna be your love
