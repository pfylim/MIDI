DARLIN'


Intro

Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd called you on the phone some,
but I don't have a dime.
Darlin', you're so far behind me,
tomorrow's gonna find me
further down the line -
Taking me some paper, pencil in my hand
I'm gonna write:

Darlin', you know I feel the cold nights,
thinking of the old nights,
spend along with you.
Darlin', the tear is in my eye now,
knowing I can try now
to make it back to you-ou - oh yeah!

Instrumental

Zwischenvers:
Darlin', love you more than ever, 
wish we were together, Darlin' mine.

ZischenstÅck: 

Darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome,
I'd called on the phone some,
but I don't have a dime.
Darlin', you're so far behind me,
tomorrow's gonna find me
further down the li-ine -

Oh, my darlin', I'm feeling pretty lonesome (Zwischenruf: Darlin')
I'd called you on the phone some (Oh yeah!)
but I don't have a dime.(That wouldn't, I ...)
Darlin' (Darlin'), I'm feeling pretty lonesome (Ou-ou-ou)
I'd called you on the phone some,
but I don't have a dime.

Repeat and Fade out
