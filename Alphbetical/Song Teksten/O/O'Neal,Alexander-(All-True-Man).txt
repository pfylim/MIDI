Title  : All True Man
Singer : Alexander O'Neal


When you need a friend, someone you can lean on
Who will understand, understand your problems
When you need a lover, someone who will satisfy
Don't you call no other no, no
Just call me anytime, I'll be there to fulfill your every need

Chorus:
If you want a man, strong and sensitive
Anything you need, I'll be willing to give
Every day and night, I will treat you right
You need an all true man

When you need to cry, I'll be there to dry your eyes
You don't have to suffer no more, it will be alright
The secret is being complete in your life
If you're an all true woman, you need an all true man
I'll be there to fulfill your every need

Chorus
