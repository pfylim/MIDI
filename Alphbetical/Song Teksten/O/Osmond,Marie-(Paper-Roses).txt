Title  : PAPER ROSES

I realize the way your eyes deceived me
With tender looks that I mistook for love
So take away the flowers that you gave me
And send the kind that you remind me of

Refrain:
Paper roses, paper roses
Oh how real those roses seemed to me
But they're only imitation
Like your imitation love for me

I thought that you would be a perfect lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the start
But like a big red rose that's made of paper
There isn't any sweetness in you heart

Refrain: ...(2x)...
