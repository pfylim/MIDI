12. ONE OF US - JOAN OSBORNE

Yeah, yeah- God is great
Yeah, yeah- God is good
Yeah, yeah- yeah (3x)

Chorus
What if God was one of us?
Just a slob like one of us?
Just a stranger on a bus, trying to make his way home.
If god had a face, what would it look like.
And would you want to see if 
Seeing meant that you would have
To believe in things like heaven and in Jesus 
And the saints and all the prophets and.

Chorus
Tryin' to make his way home
Back up to heaven all alone.
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the pope maybe in Rome.

Chorus
Just tryin' to make his way home
Like a holy rolling stone...
Back up to heaven all alone
Just tryin' to make his way home
Nobody callin' on the phone
'Cept for the pope maybe in Rome.
