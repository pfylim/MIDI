ROY ORBISON - SHE'S A MYSTERY TO ME 

Darkness falls and she will take me by the hand
Take me to some twilight land
Where all but love is grey
Where time just slips away
Without her as my guide
Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell
Am I left to burn

She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
In the night of love words tangled in her hair
Words soon to disappear
A love so sharp it cuts like a switchblade
to my heart
words tearing me apart
She tears again my bleeding heart
I want to run she's pulling me apart
Fallen angel cries
She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl

Haunted by her side the darkness in her eyes
But that so enslaves me
If my love is blind then I don't want to see
She's a mystery to me

Night falls I'm cast beneath her spell
Daylight comes our heaven's torn to hell
Am I left to burn and burn eternally
She's a mystery to me
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
She's a Mystery Girl
