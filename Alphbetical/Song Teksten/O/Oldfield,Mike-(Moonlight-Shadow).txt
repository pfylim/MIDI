MOONLIGHT SHADOW - MIKE OLDFIELD


Intro

1. Strophe:
The last that ever she saw him - carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning -carried away by a moonlight shadow
Lost in a riddle that saturday night
- far away on the other side
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.

2. Strophe:
The trees that whisper in the evening
- carried away by a moonlight shadow 
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
- carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was the silhouette of a gun     
- far away on the other side
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.

Refrain:
I stay, I pray - see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray - see you in heaven one day

3. Strophe:
Four a.m. in the morning - carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watch your vision forming - carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stars move slowly in a silvery night
- far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she could'nt find how to push through

Refrain: 
I stay, I pray, see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray, see you in heaven one day

Guitarsolo
 
4. Strophe:
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five 
The night was heavy heavy and the air was alive
But she could'nt find how to push through
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
