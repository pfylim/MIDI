Oh, we are mirrors in the sun and we brightly shine
we are singing and dancing in perfect time
there is nothing in the world that we can do
to stop the light of love come shinig through
and the power of a new born moments
is shining round you
oh, perfect stranger I feel I know you
come be with me for
we are, we are, we are, we are perfect.

Mirrors in the sun and we brightly shine
we are singing and dancing in perfect time
there is nothing in the world that we can do
to stop the light of love come shinig through
and the fire of a golden light
is shining round you
the wind is cold and I lond to hold you
come, be with me for
we are, we are, we are, we are perfect.

Mirrors in the sun and we brightly shine
we are singing and dancing in perfect time
there is nothing in the world that we can do
to stop the light of love come shining through
the streets are filled with bells
and the snow is falling
there's so many things I long to tell you
can you hear me calling
come be with me for
we are, we are, we are, we are perfect.
