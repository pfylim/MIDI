John Brown's body lies amouldring in the grave,
John Brown's body lies amouldring in the grave,
John Brown's body lies amouldring in the grave
but his soul is marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
but his soul is marching on.

The stars of heaven are looking kindly down,
the stars of heaven are looking kindly down,
the stars of heaven are looking kindly down
on the grave of old John Brown.
Glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
on the grave of old John Brown.

He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord,
he's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord,
he's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord,
and his soul goes marching on.
Glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
glory, glory hallelujah,
and his soul goes marching on.
