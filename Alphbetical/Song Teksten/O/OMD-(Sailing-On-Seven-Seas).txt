   Sailing on seven sees          OMD

  
You say 'love capture me'
Not unless you give it free.
Sailing on the seven seas,
Sister Ray is on TV.

The light of love it shines so bright,
That the FBI won't sleep tonight.

'Cause I'm so in love with you, 
And I don't know what to do,
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue.

Sick and tired, don't know why,
Skin and bone touch the sky.
Satelites can't bring me down,
'Cause I sow my soul all over town.

And I'm so in love with you,
And I don't know what to do,
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue.

Intro

People try to drag us down,
So we learn to swim before we drown.

'Cause I'm so in love with you,
That I don't know what to do,
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue.

'Cause I'm so in love with you,
And I don't know what to do,
And I'm sailing on the seven seas so blue.
