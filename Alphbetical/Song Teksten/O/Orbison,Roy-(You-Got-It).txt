    You got it         Roy Orbison 


Everytime I look into you lovely eye,
I see a love that money just can't buy.
One look from you , I drift away ,
I pray that you are here to stay.

Refrain

Anything you want - you got it
Anything you need - you got it
Anything at all - you got it , baby !

Everytime I hold you I begin to understand.
Everything about you tells me I'm your man.
I live my life to be with you ,
No one can do the things you do.

Refrain        2x

Anything you want - you got it ...


I'm glad to give my love to you ,
I know you feel the way I do .

Refrain

Anything you want - you got it ...
