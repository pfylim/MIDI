Vers 1:
Sie:   In the morning  when the moon is out to trust
       You will see me  at the time I love the best
       Watching rainbows  play on sunlights
       Pools of water  icestream cold nights

Beide: In the morning  'tis the morning of my life

Vers 2:
Beide: In the daytime  I will meet you as before
       You will find me  waiting by the ocean floor
       Building castles  in the shifting sands
       In a wo-orld  that no one understands

Beide: In the morning  'tis the morning of my life 
       'tis the morning of my life

Beide: In the morning  of my life

Vers 4:
Beide: In the evening  I will fly you to the moon
       To the topright hand corner of the ceiling in my room
       Where we'll stay-ay  until the su-un shines
       Another day-ay  to swing on clothes lines

Beide: May I be yawning - 'til the morning of my life 
       'tis the morning of my life
