Title  : DEEP PURPLE

The sun is sinking low behind the hill
I loved you long ago, I love you still
Across the years you come to me at twilight
To bring me love's old thrill

You taught me all that life was meant to be
In all my thoughts your face I seem to see
And Fate will find whatever may be its changes
no other love for me

When the Deep Purple falls over sleepy garden walls
And the stars begin to flicker in the sky
Through the mist of a memory, you wander back to me
Breathing my name with a sigh
In the still of the night
Once again I hold you tight
Though you're gone, your love lives on
When moonlight beams
And as long as my heart may beat
Lover we'll always meet here in my Deep Purple dreams
