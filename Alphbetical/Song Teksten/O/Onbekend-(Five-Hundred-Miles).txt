1:
If you miss the train I'm on 
you will know that i am gone,
you can hear the whistle blow one hundred miles,
one hundred miles, one hundred miles,
one hundred miles, one hundred miles,
you can hear the whistle blow one hundred miles.

2:
Lord I'm one, Lord I'm two,
Lord I'm three, Lord I'm four,
Lord I'm five hundred miles from home,
five hundred miles, five hundred miles,
five hundred miles, five hundred miles,
Lord I'm five hundred miles from home.

3:
Not a shirt on my back,
not a penny to my  name,
Lord, I can't go a home thisway.
Thisway, thisway, thisway, thisway,
Lord, I can't go a home thisway.
