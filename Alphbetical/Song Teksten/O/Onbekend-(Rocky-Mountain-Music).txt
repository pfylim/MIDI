           Rocky Mountain Music


Back upon an old dort roud
next to a swap full of toals
was a splended mooncheck
with three little kids and a mama

Papa died in '63
left little Jimmy and me
to plan those tatoes
pull up another tomorrow

Rocky mountain music
thrills my memory
rocky mountain music
papa can I hear you
playing for me

Little brother was never quite right
he uses to sit on the floor in the sunlight
played with the dust
that danced on the ceals in the window

Sister had to cook an cleam
cause mama she got sick I mean
sometimes I think
she just died away missing papa

Rocky mountain music......

Well everything has changed today
little brother he was taken away
sister she married a soldier
an lives in Toledo

An me I'm in a Nashville bar
an I've never been so far
from that old gravy road
and that river that runs through my mem'ry

Rocky mountain music.....
