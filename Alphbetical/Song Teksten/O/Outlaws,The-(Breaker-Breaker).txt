Singer : THE OUTLAWS 
Title  : BREAKER, BREAKER

Breaker, breaker take me home
You're the one I wanna see

Give me your north bound seven five
I've been headed for the Tampa Town south bound in my ride
Eight more hours I'll be shifting gears
Look over your shoulder guy won't you lend me your ears

Been so long since I've seen my home
Got to get on down that road tonight
The one I love's waiting there for me
With open arms and love in her eyes
Seeing the days and the nights pass me by
I've been seeing the road signs
White lines are in my eyes
Hands on the wheel with my radio oh
This is pony boy breaker down, and I'm going home
You know I've tried to make the best of it
There's some things a man's just got to do
Big ten wheels keep on rolling along
And I'll be there before the morning dew

Breaker, breaker take me home, clear the highway for me
Breaker, breaker take me home, you know the one I wanna see

Hearing that ol' lonesome highway a song I've been hearing
The diesel hum she's running again back on the road
I got a heavy land, look over my shoulder now it's clear to L.A.
Been so long since I've seen my home
Got to get on down that road tonight
Freeways and highways and back roads and by ways and come on
Back your cotton picker you

Breaker, breaker take me home, clear the highway for me
Breaker, breaker take me home, you know the one I wanna see
