Titel:        WHEN THE NIGHT'S ON FIRE

I was hoping, could you be my inspiration
whatever should become in the candlelight
I was dreaming, was it my imagination
tomorrow never comes in the candlelight.

When the night's on fire
do you need love's arms to hold you
it's a flame there burns no finer
when you see one bird
there's another on watching over
and the two can fly much higher.

I was listening, to the wind that walks the hours
I never would have heard
in the candlelight
I was hoping, would you shelter me from showers
I believe every word in the candlelight.

When the night's on fire and you burn
like a flame that's burning in the rain
do you need somewhere to turn
when you see one bird
it's the two that fly higher
and a second in heaven's worth whole life's
trouble and trial.
