Title  : I'M GONNA KNOCK ON YOUR DOOR

I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell
Tap on your window too
If you don't come out tonight when the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock'n ring'n tap until you do

I'm gonna knock on your door, call out your name
Wake up the town you'll see
I'm gonna whoohoot and howl like a lovesick owl
Until you say you're gonna come out with me

Hey little girl this ain't no time to sleep
Let's count kisses instead o'countin' sheep
How how can I hold you near
With you up there and me down here

I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell
Tap on your window too
If you don't come out tonight when the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock'n ring'n tap until you do
I'm gonna knock'n ring'n tap I'm gonna
knockin' ring'n tap until you do
