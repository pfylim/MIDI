PHIL OAKEY & GIORGIO MORODER - TOGETHER IN ELECTRIC DREAMS

I only knew you for a while
I never saw your smile
'Til it was time to go
Time to go always (time to go always)
Sometimes it's hard to recognize
Love comes as a surprise
And it's too late
It's just too late to stay
Too late to stay

Refrain:
We'll always be together
However far it seems
(Love never ends)
We'll always be together
Together in electric dreams

Because the friendship that you gave
Has taught me to be brave
No matter where I'll go, I'll never find a better prize
(Find a better prize)
Thought you're miles and miles away
I see every day, I don't have to try
I just close my eyes, I close my eyes

Refrain: ...
