Some-times- the- snow- comes- down- in- June
Some-times- the- sun- goes- 'round- the- moon

I- see- the- pas-sion- in- your- eyes
Some-times- it's- all- a- big- sur-prise

Cause- there- was- a- time- when- all- I- did- was- wish
You'd- tell- me- this- was- love

It's- not- the- way- I- hoped- or- how- I- planned
But- some-how- it's- e-nough

But- now- we're- stan-ding- face- to- face
Is-n't- this- world- a- cra-zy- place

Just- when- I- thought- our- chance- had- passed
You- go- and- save- the- best- for- last

All- of- the- nights- you- came- to- me
When- some- sil-ly- boy- had- set- you- free

I- won-dered- how- you'd- make- it- through
I- won-dered- what- was- wrong- with- you

Cause- how- could- you- give- your- love
To- some-one- else
But- share- your- dreams- with- me

Some-times- the- ve-ry- thing- you're- look-ing- for
Is- the- one- thing- you- can't- see

But- now- we're- stand-ing- face- to- face
Is-n't- this- world- a- cra-zy- place

Just- when- I- thought- our- chance- had- passed
You- go- and- save- the- best- for- last

Doo- doo- doo- doo- doo- doo- doo
Doo- doo- doo- doo- doo

Some-times- the- ve-ry- thing- you're- look-ing- for
Is- the- one- thing- you- can't- see

Some-times- the- snow- comes- down- in- June
Some-times- the- sun- goes- 'round- the- moon

Just- when- I- thought- our- chance- had- passed
You- go- and- save- the- best- for- last
You- went- and- saved- the- best- for- last.
