Singer : BILLY OCEAN 
Title  : LOVE REALLY HURTS WITHOUT YOU

You run around town like a fool
And you think that it's over
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye
You don't give nothing to me

You painted a smile and you dress
All the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on
I know that it's wrong
Baby love really hurts without you

You walk like a dream
And you make like you're queen of the action
You're using ev'ry trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see

You cheat and you lie to impress any guy
That you fancy
But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign and help to ease the pain inside me
Baby love really hurts without you
