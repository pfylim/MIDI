Once in a life time you find that power
to break out and run from the devils deep clutch
all that you need its the finest hour
is to believe in the Magic Touch.

A thief in the night,
love steals you far away.
A thief in the night,
love takes your breath away.
Can't believe it, like no other
love is a gift and to take you so much
you need the blue night to discover
only true lovers have the Magic Touch.

Once in a lifetime you find that faith
when your under the spell and it takes control
everything round you just falls in place
and all that you touch seems to turn to gold.

A thief in the night,
love steals you far away.
A thief in the night,
love takes your breath away.
Can't believe it, like no other
love is a gift and to take you so much
you need the blue night to discover
only true lovers have the Magic Touch.
