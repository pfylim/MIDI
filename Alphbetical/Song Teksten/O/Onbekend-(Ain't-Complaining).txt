AIN'T COMPLAINING



There's nothing left  there's nothing right
There's nothing left  there's nothing right
There's nothing left  right left right
Up down up down up down up down    All right all right 
You wind me up you bring me down
Your reputation is all over the town
So long as you come  home to me     I ain't complaining
You fool around we scream and fight
The way you're treating me  you know it ain't right
But when you're making out with me    I ain't complaining
REFRAIN: It ain't no use in playing it loose
And thinking it don't matter to me   It ain't fair at all
you only have to call my name   And I'll come running to you
All right all right all right all right   You're out all night
you sleep all day When I get home you're going out to play
Oh woman give me some time and everything's fine
I ain't complaining You just don't care
we're in a mess, And the company you keep ain't the best
But you're lying there with me     I ain't complaining
REFRAIN: 
But when the chips are down 
A man  can only take so much foolin' around
And if you don't come home to me    I'll be complaining

All right
There's nothing left there's nothing right
Our situation ain't looking too bright 'cause I have taken all
I'm gonna take Without complaining
REFRAIN:
All right all right all right all right
All right all right
