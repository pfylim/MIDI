Title  : PATA PATA

(Words & music: Miriam Makeba/Ragovoy)

Everybody gett on down
I feel patapa
Get the latest spring in town
I feel patapa
Get the sound and feel the beat
I feel patapa
Time to move and shake your feet
I feel patapa

Chorus:
Mama hiyo mama hiyo ma
I feel patapa
Hear me mama, hear me now
I feel patapa
Oh mama hio mama hiyo ma
I feel patapa
Hear me mama, hear me now
I feel patapa

If the going starts to move
I feel patapa
Let the rhythm feel the groove
I feel patapa
Clap your hands and sing along
I feel patapa
Such a happy, happy song
I feel patapa

It won't be long to find your love
I feel patapa
It must be me you're thinking of
I feel patapa
Pata pata is the game
I feel patapa
So get on down and state your claim
I feel patapa

Chorus: ...

Patapata is the game
I feel patapa (13x)
