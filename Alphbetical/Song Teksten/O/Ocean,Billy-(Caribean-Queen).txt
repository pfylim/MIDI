      Carribean Queen             Billy Ocean 


She's simply awesome ...

She touched by me in painted on jeans
And all have turned 'cause she was the queen 
In the blink of a night I knew her number and her name
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

Refrain 

Caribbean Queen now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run 


I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in surch of a good time
Just running my game , yeah
Love was the furthest , furthest from my mind

Refrain 

Caribbean Queen  ( can't give you up )
Now we're sharing the same dream  ( don't wanna stop )
And our hearts they beat as one   ( ooh yeah )
No more love on the run  ( I love ya , I need ya )
