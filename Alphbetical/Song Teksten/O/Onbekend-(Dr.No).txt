DR NO


Lonely weekend sunday afternoon
you're so lonesome in your lonely room
no more huggin'
no more sweet caress
no more sweet talk on the phone

Refrain
Call on Dr. No
Agent number O
I'm the famous man behind the face
call on Dr. No
Agent number O
incredibly invisible in each and every place
Dr. No
Agent number O
I will kiss and comfort you
call on me
I'll be there 
everytime and everywhere
call on Dr. No O-O-O

I'm no phantom of the opera
I am no mummy of the river Nile
I am the secret service for broken heart affairs
I will love you for a while
