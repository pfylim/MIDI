Title  : Nothing Compares 2 U
Singer : Sinead O'Connor


It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since U took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since U took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whom ever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothin' I said nothin' can take away these blues

Chorus:
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares 2 U
Nothing nothing

It's been so lonely without U here
Like a bird without a song
Nothin' can stop these lonely tears from fallin'
Tell me baby where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of U
I went 2 the doctor, guess what he told me, guess
  what he told me?
He said, "girl U better try 2 have fun no matter what
  U do", but he's a fool

Chorus

All the flowers that U planted
Mama in the backyard
All died when U went away
I know that livin' with U baby was sometimes hard
But I'm willing 2 give it another try

Chorus
