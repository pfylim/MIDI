Title  : RED LIGHT

(Words & music: Findon/Charles)

Red light, spells danger
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light, means warning
Can't hold out I'm burning

You took my heart and turned me on
And now the danger sign is on
I never thought the day would come
When I would feel alone without you
But now I'm like a child again
Calling out his mama's name
You got me on a ball and chain
Doing things that I don't want to

Can't stop running to you
Feel love coming through you
Girl with you beside me
Hold on heaven guide
Red light spells danger
Can't hold out much longer
'Cause red light, means warning
Can't hold out I'm burning

I had my fun and plays around
Without a love to tie me down
I always used to kiss and run
I never wanted love to catch me
I thought I had a heart of stone
But now I'm in the danger zone
I can feel the heat is on
Soon the flames are gonna get me
