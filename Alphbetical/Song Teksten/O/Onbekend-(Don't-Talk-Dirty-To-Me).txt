DON'T TALK DIRTY TO ME


I always seem to fall in love
With the wrong person
You whisper in my ear
All the things you thought
   I'd want to hear
Your approach was much too strong
Instead of love we're in the danger zone
Baby there are better ways
   to get to know someone
And I've always been the type
   to never bite my tongue
So cool it out,
   I'm not gonna change my mind
I like you just the way your are girl
Do I have to shout, I'm asking you please
Don't talk dirty to me
I really don't think it's time
To try to seduce me with your lines
Why you wanna try something new
In my opinion I just call it rude
If you take a moment just to notice
I'm into you
So those words
   can't make my feelings stronger
To tell the truth
It's not ladylike
You should try to show some class
Have some finesse girl
You're the best
Do I have to shout
I'm asking you please
Don't talk dirty to me
No no
 the fakers flee
And let nature work
Like it does for me cos I'm down to earth
Close ya mouth
