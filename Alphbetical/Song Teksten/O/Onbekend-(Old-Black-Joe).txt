Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay.
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away
gone from the earth to a better land I know
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.

I'm coming I'm coming for my ear is bending low,
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.

Why do I weep when my heart should feel no pain ?
Why do I sigh that my friends come not again
grieving for forms now departed long ago
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.

I'm coming I'm coming for my ear is bending low,
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.

Where are the hearts once so happy and so free ?
Children so dear that held upon my knee
gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.

I'm coming I'm coming for my ear is bending low,
I hear their gentle voices calling:
Old Black Joe.
