                    The one and only


I am the one and only

Call me call me by my number call me by my nunber
put me through I still be doing it the way I do it
and yet you try to make me forget who I really am
don't tell me I knew best I'm not the same as all the rest

Refrain

I am the one and only nobody i'd rather be
I am the one and only you can't save that away from me


I've been a player in the crosses a flicker
in the big street my soul embrasses one more in a million
faces high hopes and desperations I miss I found
my station may be but all this time I try to walk 
with my dignity and pride

Refrain

I am the one and only ...

I can't await this here what for without some
compromisses because you found out that we come
in different shapes and sizes
noone could be myself like I can for this job
I'm the best man if all this maybe true you are
the one and only you

Refrain

I am the one and only ...
