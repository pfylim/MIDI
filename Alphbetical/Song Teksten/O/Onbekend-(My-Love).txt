My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, 
softer than a sight,
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean, 
wider than the sky,
my love is brighter than the brightest star 
that shines every night above,
and there is nothing in this world 
that could ever change my love.

And something happened to my heart 
the day that I met you,
something that I never felt before,
You are always on my mind, no matter what I do,
and every day it seems I want you more.

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, 
softer than a sight,
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean, 
wider than the sky,
my love is brighter than the brightest star 
that shines every night above,
and there is nothing in this world 
that could ever change my love.

Once I thought that love was meant for anyone else but me,
once I thought, you'd never come my way.
Now it only goes to show how warm we all can be,
for now I have to tell you every day:
My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, 
softer than a sight,
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean, 
wider than the sky,
my love is brighter than the brightest star 
that shines every night above,
and there is nothing in this world 
that could ever change my love.

My love is warmer than the warmest sunshine, 
softer than a sight,
my love is deeper than the deepest ocean, 
wider than the sky,
my love is brighter than the brightest star 
that shines every night above,
and there is nothing in this world 
that could ever change my love.
