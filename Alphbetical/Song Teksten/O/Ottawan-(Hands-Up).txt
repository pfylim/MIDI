Love your ways. I like your style

Don`t think twice or count till ten
Don`t take advice. Don`t ask me when
Just come my way simply kiss me and say

With your head up in the sky
Everyday you`re walking by
Why don`t you ever start looking at me
Stop that game. Don`t waste your time
For all your dreams are matching mine
No use to play hide and seek for a week

All your love. All your love. 

Let me be your Romeo, your Wonderboy
And your Superchamp
Let me take you to the Milky Way
On a holiday. On a holiday
Follow me. Why don`t you follow me
Just come my way simply kiss me and say
