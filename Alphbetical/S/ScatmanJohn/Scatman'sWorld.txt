Scatman's World
Babobebo...

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy

Everybody `s talkin`
Something very shockin
Just to keep on blocking
What they`re feeling inside
But listen to me brother
You just keep on walking
`Cause you and me and sister ain`t got nothing to hide

Scatman fat man
Black and white and brown man
Tell me `bout the colour of your soul
If part of your solution
Isn`t ending with pollution
Than I don`t wanna hear your stories told
I wanna welcome you to Scatman`s world

Babobebo...

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy

Everybody`s born to compete as he chooses
But how can someone win
If winning means that someone looses
I sit and see and wonder what it`s like to be in touch
No wonder all my brothers and my sisters need a cruch

I wanna be a human beeing not a human doing
I couldn`t keep that pace up if I tried
The source of my intention really isn`t crime prevention
My intention is prevention of the lie, yeah
Welcome to the Scatman`s world

Babobebo...

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy

Scibidibi...

Babobebo...

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy

Listen to me

I`m calling out from Scatland
I`m calling out from Scatman`s world
If you wanna break free
You better listen to me
You`ve got to learn how to see
In your fantasy
