The telephone is not answered, so many times you called
For many different reasons, so many tears will fall to far

You find your love before, it comes knockin` at your door
Before you know for shure, this is what you are waiting for

So many fears will hurt you, `till I don`t fall in grants
So ment I wake you answer, and you will not forgive your falt

You find your love before, it comes knockin` at your door
Before you know for shure, this is what you are waiting for

There`s a story of a man, who loved to much,
he ended up inside a prison cell
You`ve got to one to give to get it
or you can land up in the same suspicious hell

It`s happen before
It`s happen before

Colds in tense in passion, will ment his faith, don`t part
Don`t we see my own way, all was happen here before

You find your love before, it comes knockin` at your door
Before you know for shure, this is what you are waiting for

One day, when the phone stops ringing, you`ll answer to the
words, 
you`re longing for
No tears, no treat, no prison cell
Well he need, he will read a more

It`s happen before
It`s happen before
 
You find your love before, it comes knockin` at your door
Before you know for shure, this is what you are waiting for
You find your love before, it comes knockin` at your door
Before you know for shure, this is what you are waiting for

It`s happen before
It`s happen before
