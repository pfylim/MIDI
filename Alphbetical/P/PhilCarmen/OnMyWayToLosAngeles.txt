	 On my way to L.A.  					Phil Carmen

                                      
         Took a trip down to L.A. for the weekend,
         Let my hair flow and my inspiration grow,
         On my way to L.A.
         Touch down through the small cloud on the runway,
         There's a sandy Maria sweet and easy,
         Make a deep scene such a sweet dream nice and breezy,
         On my way to L.A.
         In the meantime on the fort of California...

         An emotion by the ocean, what an idea,
         Move on over little over gonna stay,
         On my way in L.A.
         On my way in L.A.
         In the meantime on the fort of California...

         On my way in L.A.
         On my way in L.A.

         In the meantime on the fort of California...



         ...........Fade out..............
