It's late in the evening
she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make up
and brushes her long hair
And she asks me do I look all right 
And I say yes you look wonderful tonight

Solo 1x

We go to a party and every one turns to see
This beautifull lady is walking around with me
And then she asks me do you feel all right
And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes
Then the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize
how much I love you

Solo 2x

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
so I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed.
And then I tell her as I turn out the light 
I say my darling you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight

Solo 2x
