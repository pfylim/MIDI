The Connells  '74-75'

(music and lyrics by Mike Connell)

Got no reason
For come to me and the rain running down
There's no reason
And the same voice
Come to me like a towel slowing down
And believe me
I was the one that you know
I was you sorry ever after
'74-'75

It's not easy
Nothing to say cause it's already said
It's never easy
When I look of in your eyes
Then I find it hard to find
When I look of in your eyes then I'll do better
I was the one that you know
I was you sorry ever after
'74-'75
Givin' me more and I'll do fine
Cause you really only after
'74-'75

Got no reason
For come to me and the rain running down
There's no reason
When I look of in your eyes
Then I find it hard to find
When I look of in your eyes then I'll do better
I was the one that you know
I was you sorry ever after
'74-'75

Givin' me more and I'll do fine
Cause you really only after
'74-'75
I was the one that you know
I was you sorry ever after
'74-'75
Givin' me more and I'll do fine
Cause you really only after
'74-'75
