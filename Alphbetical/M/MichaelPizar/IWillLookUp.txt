I WILL LOOK UP

I will look up to the heavens declaring the Glory of God,
And with the firmament, showeth His handiwork.
Day unto day is proclaiming, and night shines the pow'r of His Word.
There is no speech and no language where these voices cannot be heard.

Praise the LORD! He is worthy of honor.
Praise the LORD! Let His Glory amaze.
Praise ye the LORD!  He is worthy of all of our praise.

        Alleluiah! It is written,
        His eternal power and nature
        Are clearly revealed since creation,
        The glorious things of His handiwork.

Praise the LORD! He is worthy of honor.
Praise the LORD! Let His Glory amaze.
Praise ye the LORD!  He is worthy of all of our praise.
        Praise ye the LORD!  He is worthy of all of our praise.
