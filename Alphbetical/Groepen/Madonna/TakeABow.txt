TAKE A BOW				MADONNA


Take a bow
The night is over
This masquerade is getting older 
Lights are low
The curtains am down
There's no one here
(There's no one here in the crowd) 
Say your lines
But do you feel them
Do you mean what you say
When there's no one around 
Watching you, watching me
One lonely star 
(One lonely star
You don't know who you are) 

Chorus:
I've always been in love with you 
I guess you've always known 
It's true
You took my love
For granted why oh why
The show is over say good-bye 
Say good-bye, say good-bye 
Make them laugh 
It comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart 
Hide behind your smile
All the world loves a clown
(Just make 'em smile
The whole world loves a clown) 
Wish you well 
I cannot stay
You deserve an award
For the role that you played
No more masquerade 
You're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

Chorus

All the world is a stage
And everyone has their part
How was I to know
Which way the story'd go
You'd break, you'd break, you'd break
You'd breakmy heart

Chorus
