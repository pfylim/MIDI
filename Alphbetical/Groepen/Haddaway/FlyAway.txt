Fly Away
Fly Away

It's the dream of worse emotion and another place and time.
I guess some feeling lost in the home, my thought was mine.
It's a universal notion, life is just a battlefield.
Open your heart for someone, nothing is refill.

Fly away, you can leave it all behind you.
I'm on my way to find you and I soon will flying, too.
Fly away, we can fly away together,
I'm talking about the weather, this is all we got of you,
Fly away!

It's the tango of emotion, will you stay or will you go.
I'm the one to call on the phone that you would know.

Fly away, you can leave it all behind you.
I'm on my way to find you and I soon will flying, too.
Fly away, we can fly away together,
I'm talking about the weather, this is all we got of you,
Fly away!

Da fly away
Da fly away
Drive with me

Fly away, you can leave it all behind you.
I'm on my way to find you and I soon will flying, too.
Fly away, we can fly away together,
I'm talking about the weather, this is all we got of you,
Fly away!

Fly away!
