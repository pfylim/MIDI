Titel: Over my shoulder    
Interpret: Mike & The Mechanics

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
I never wanted to say good-bye

Looking back over my shoulder 
With an aching deep in my heart
I wish we where starting over
Oh, instead of drifting
so far apart

Everybody told me you where leaving
Funny I should be the last to know
Baby, please tell me that I`m dreaming
I just never want to let you go

Looking back over my shoulder 
I can see that look in your eye 
Turning my heart over and over
I never wanted to say good-bye

I don`t mind everybody laughing
But it`s enough to make a grown man cry
`cause I can feel you slipping through my fingers
I don`t even know the reason why

Whisteling

Everyday, it`s a loosing battle
Just a smile and home I head up high
Could it be we belong together
Baby won`t you give me one more try

One more try 

Looking back over my shoulder
I can see that look in your eye
I never dreamed it could be over
But I never wanted to say good-bye

Looking back over my shoulder 
With an aching feeling in side
Could it be up, deeper and deeper
Fills me with a sadness
I can`t hide

Repeat and fade out

Fade out
