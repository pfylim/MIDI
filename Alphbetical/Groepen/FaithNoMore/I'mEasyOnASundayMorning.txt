I'm Easy

Know it sounds funny, but I just can't stand the pain;
girl I'm leaving you tomorrow.
seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed, yeah

refrein
ooh, that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah
that's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right.
I wanna be free just me, oh, babe.

refrein tot einde
