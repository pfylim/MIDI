Put me up, put me down, put my feet back on the ground,
put me up, take my heart and make me happy.
Put me up, put me down, put my feet back on the ground,
put me up, feel my heart and make me happy.

Here we go, get`s move to the groove, watching all the ladies
as a screw that I move.
Is that what they say, what I can«t prove
They turn it up again, what we move to the groove
As we get closed, you whispered Coco, I hold you in my arms 
and you said Jamboo.
Scream and shout, turn a second Lamboo, now a got to go for Coco.

Put me up, put me down, put my feet back on the ground,
put me up, take my heart and make me happy.
Put me up, put me down, put my feet back on the ground,
put me up, feel my heart and make me happy.
