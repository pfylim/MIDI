AN ANGEL              THE KELLY FAMILY


Wish I had your pair of wings
had them last night in my dreams
I was chasing butterflies
till the sunrise broke my eyes

Tonight the sky has glued my eyes
's what they see's  an angel high
I've got to touch that magic sky
and greet the angels in their high

Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you


All the sweet honey from above
pour it all over me sweet love
And while you're flyin' around my head
your honey kisses keep me fed

I wish I had your pair of wings
just like last night in my dreams
I was lost in paradise
wish I'd never opened my eyes


Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you


But there's danger in the air
tryin' so hard to be unfair
Danger's in the air
tryin' so hard to give us a scare
But we're not afraid

(+ Chor)
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Sometimes I wish I were an angel
Sometimes I wish I were you
Wish I were you
Oh I wish I were you
