Roses of Red / Kelly FAMILY


Roses of red fall on my head
He smiled then turn away
Roses of red grow in my heart
They bloom when he passes me by

Cause he he makes me happy
And he he makes me fly
Oh oh oh
I bloom when he passes me by

If you want paradise
then look at my eyes
I`m as clear as the sky when it`s blue
If you want paradise
Then look at me twice
Cause I`m not a normal red rose

And he he makes me crazy
And he he makes me fly
Oh oh oh
I bloom when he passes me by

I know that he doesn`t know me
He`s just too different no no
I know he knows and he knows I know
we`re just too different no no

Roses of red fall on my head
He smiled then turned away
Roses of red fall in my heart
They bloom when he passes me by
Oh oh oh
I bloom when he passes me by
Oh oh oh
Smiled and turned away
