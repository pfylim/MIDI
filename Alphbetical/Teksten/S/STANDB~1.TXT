    STAND BY YOUR MAN  (B. Sherill/T. Wynette)


SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO BE A WOMAN
GIVING ALL YOUR LOVE  TO JUST ONE MAN
YOU 'LL HAVE BAD TIMES
AND HE 'LL HAVE GOOD TIMES
DOING THINGS THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND



BUT IF YOU LOVE HIM YOU 'LL FORGIVE HIM
EVEN THOUGH HE 'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND
AND IF YOU LOVE HIM, THEN BE PROUD OF HIM
CAUSE AFTER ALL HE 'S JUST A MAN



STAND BY YOUR MAN
GIVE HIM TWO ARMS TO CLING TO
AND SOMETHING WARM TO COME TO
WHEN NIGHTS ARE COLD AND LONELY

STAND BY YOUR MAN
AND SHOW THE WORLD YOU LOVE HIM
KEEP GIVING ALL THE LOVE YOU CAN
STAND BY YOUR MAN.
