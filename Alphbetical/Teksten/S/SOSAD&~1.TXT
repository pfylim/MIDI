SO SAD     THE EVERLY BROTHERS
WE USED TO HAVE TIMES TOGETHER
BUT NOW I FEEL THEM SLIP AWAY
IT MAKES ME CRY TO SEE LOVE DIE
SO SAD TO WATCH GOOD LOVE GO BAD

REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO FEEL DEAR
YOU SAD NOTHING COULD CHANGE YOU'RE MIND
IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE US PART
SO SAD TO WATCH GOOD LOVE GO BAD

IS IT ANY WONDER THAT I FEEL SO BLUE
WHEN I KNOW FOR CERTAIN 
THAT I'M LOSING YOU OO OO
REMEMBER ENZ....
DREAM  DREAM
DREAM DREAM DREAM DREAM DREAM 2X
WHEN I WANT YOU IN MY ARMS
WHEN I WANT YOU AND ALL YOUR CHARMS
WHEN EVER I WANT YOU
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DREAM
DREAM DREAM DREAM DREAM
WHEN I FEELBLUE IN THE NIGHT
AND I NEED YOU TO HOLD ME TIGHT
WHENEVER I WANT YOU ALL I HAVE TO DO DREAM

I CAN MAKE YOU MINE
TASTE YOUR LIPS OF WINE
ANY TIME NIGHT OR DAY
ONLY TROUBLE IS GEE WIZ
I'M DREAMING MY LIFE AWAY
I NEED YOU SO THAT I COULD DIE
I LOVE YOU SO AND THAT IS WHY
WENEVER I WANT YOU
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DREAM DREAM DREAM DREAM
