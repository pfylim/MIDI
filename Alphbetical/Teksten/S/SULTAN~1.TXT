***** SULTANS OF SWING **** DIRE STRAITS ** Dm ** WP    *

YOU GET A SHIVER IN THE DARK,
IT'S RAINING IN THE PARK, BUT MEANTIME
SOUTH OF THE RIVER YOU STOP, AND YOU HOLD EVERYTHING
A BAND IS PLAYING DIXI ,DOUBLE FOR TIME.
YOU FEEL ALRIGHT,WHEN YOU HEAR THE MUSIC RING.

WELL NOW YOU STEP INSIDE,BUT YOU DON'T SEE TO MANY FACES.
COMING IN OUT THE RAIN,TO HEAR THE JAZZ GO DOWN.
COMPETITIONS IN OTHER PLACES.
OH BUT THE HORNS.KEEP BLOWING THAT SOUND

WAY ON DOWN SOUTH , WAY ON DOWN SOUTH, LONDON TOWN

YOU CHECK OUT GUITAR GEORGE, HE KNOWS ALL THE CORDS.
MINDS HE'S STRICKLY RHYTHM, HE DOES'NT MAKE IT CRY OR SING
IF AND A OLD GUITAR IS ALL HE CAN AFFORD.
WHEN HE GETS UP UNTHER THE LIGHT TO PLAY HIS THING

AND IF HARRY DOES'NT MIND,IF HE DOES'NT MAKE THE SCENE.
HE'S GOT A DAYTIME JOB,HE'S DOING ALRIGHT.
HE CAN PLAY THE HONKY TONK LIKE ANYTHING
SAVING IT UP FOR FIIDAYNIGHT.

WITH THE SULTANS,WITH THE SULTANS OF SWING

WHERE THE CROWDY YOUN BOYS,
THE ARE FOOLING AROUND IN THE CORNER
DRUNK AND DRESSED IN THEIR BEST BROWN BAGGIES
AND THEIR FLAT FROM SOLES.
THE GIVE A DAMN,ABOUT ANY TRUMPET PLAYING BAND.
IT AINT WHAT THE CALL  ROCK AND ROLL

AND THE SULTANS, YEA THE SULTANS PLAYED CREOLE.

SOLO

AND THEN THE MAN HE STEPS RIGHT TO THE MICROPHONE
AND SAY'S AT LAST, JUST AS THE TIMEBELL RINGS.
GOODBYE NOW IT'S TIME, TO GO HOME.
AND HE MAKES IT FAST WITH ONE MORE THING.

WE ARE THE SULTANS,WE ARE THE SULTANS ,OF SWING
