          RED RED WINE UB 40

RED RED WINE, GO TO MY HEAD
MAKE'S ME FORGET THAT I,
STILL NEED HER SO O O

RED RED WINE, IT'S UP TO YOU
ALL I CAN DO I'VE DONE
MEM'RIES WON'T GO O O
STILL NEED HER SO

I HAVE THOUGHT, THAT THE TIME
THOUGHTS OF HERE  WOULD LEAVE MY HEAD
I WAS WRONG, AND I FOUND
JUST ONE THING MAKES ME FORGET

RED RED WINE, STAY CLOSE TO ME EE
DON'T LET ME BE  ALONE
IT'S TEARING APAHAAAART
MY BLUE BLUE HEART

SOLO

I HAVE THOUGHT ENZ
