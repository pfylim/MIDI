                Shake rattle and roll                  Elvis

Well get out of that bed , and wash your face , and hands  2 X
Well you get in that kitchen , make some noise with the pots a pos 2x
I believe to my soul , you,re the devel and not I know
Cause the harder I work the faster my money go

Well I said shake , rattle and roll
I said shake , rattle and roll
I said shake , rattle and roll
I said shake , rattle and roll
Well you want to do right to save your doggone soul

I,m like a one eyed cat , peeping in a sea food store 2 x
I can look at you , tell you ain,t no charms no more
I believe you , doing me wrong and now I know  2 X
Cause the harder I work the faster my money go

Refrein :

I went over the hill way down under-neath  2 X
You make me roll my eyes , you make me grin my teeth
