SHE'S LIKE A RAINBOW... SWAYS WHILE SHE GLOWS
MOVES LIKE A RIVIER ... TURNS WHILE SHE FLOWS
UUH YEAH
AND THEN SHE STEELS .  YOURE HEART AWAY
SHE'S TAKING IT ALL SOME DAY I'LL MAKE HER MINE
YEAH

THE CHERRY RED SUN WILL RISE AND LOVE WILL SHINE

WHEN SHE'S GOES NANA NANA .  NANA NANA
COLORS WILL KEEP ON TURNING
SHIMMERING BY  LIKE A RAIN BUTTERFLY
CRUISING THE BLUE BLUE SKY

OH SHE SHINES LIKE A FLOWER . FADES WHILE SHE GROWS
AND THEN SHE WIPES .  YOU TEARS AWAY
HOLDING YOUR HAND SOMEDAY LIKE LOVERS DO
YOU HESITATE . ANOTHER WHILE
SHOWING HER MAGIC SMILE AND DREAMS COME TRUE

WHEN SHE'S GOES NANA NANA . NANA NANA
