          SONG SUNG BLUE


Song Sung Blue , every-body knows one

Song Sung Blue , every garden grows one

Me and you , are sub-ject to

The blues now and then

But when you take the blues ,and make a song

You sing them out a-gain ,sing them out a-gain



Song Sung Blue , weep-in like a wil-low

Song Sung Blue , sleep-in on my pil-low

Funny thing , but you can sing it
With a cry-in your voice

And be-fore you know it start to feel-in good

You sim-ply got no choice
