A SALTY DOG                  - PROCAL HARUM -
          (Keith Reid & Gary Brooker)

ALL HANDS ON DECK, WE 'VE RUN AFLOAT
I HEARD THE CAPTAIN CRY
EXPLORE THE SHIP, REPLACE THE COOK
LET NOONE LEAVE ALIVE
ACROSS THE STRAIGHTS, AROUND THE HORN
HOW FAR CAN SAILORS FLY
A TWISTED PATH, OUR TORTURED COURSE
AND NOONE LEFT ALIVE

WE SAILED FOR PARTS UNKNOWN TO MAN
WHERE SHIPS COME HOME TO DIE
NO LOFTY PEAK NOR FORTRESS BOLD
COULD MATCH OUR CAPTAIN'S EYE
UPON THE SEVENTH SEASICK DAY
WE MAKE OUT PORT OF CALL
A SAND SO WHITE AND SEA SO BLUE
NO MOTAL PLACE AT ALL

WE FIRED THE GUN AND BURNED THE MAST
AND ROWED FROM SHIP TO SHORE
THE CAPTAIN CRIED, WE SAILORS WEPT
OUR TEARS WERE TEARS OF JOY
NOW MANY MOONS AND MANY JUNES
HAVE PASSED SINCE WE MADE LAND
A SALTY DOG THIS SEAMAN 'S LOG
YOUR WITNESS MY OWN HAND
