**** SALTWATER **** JULIAN LENNON **** 6-11-1991

WE ARE A ROCK REVOLVIEW.
WHO ARE ROUND THE GOLDEN SUN.
WE ARE A MILLION CHILDREN HOLDING TO ONE.
SO WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE HOLE IN THE SKY.
SALTWATER WELLS IN MY EYES.

WE CLIMB THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN.
WE'LL MAKE THE DESSERT BLUE.
WE'R SO INGENIUS WE CAN WALK ON THE MOON.
BUT WHEN I HEAR ABOUT THE FORREST HAS DIED.
SALTWATER WELLES IN MY EYES.

I HAVE LIVED FOR LOVE.
BUT NOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
FOR THE WORLD OUR LOVE IS DYING * AND NOU I'M CRYING *
AND TIME IS NOT A FRIEND * NO FRIENDS OF MINE *
AS FRIENDS WE'R OUT OF TIME
AND IT'S ONLY PASSING BY  YEA YEA YEA 
RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.

WE'LL LIGHT THE DIEPEST OCEAN.
SEND PHOTOGRAPS FROM MARS.
WE SO IN GENTIC BY HOW CLEVER WE ARE.
WHY SHOELD ONE BABY FEEL SO HUNGRY SHE CRIED.
SALTWATER WELLES IN MY EYES.

SOLO GITAAR

REFREIN

WE ARE A ROCK REVOLVIEW.
WHO ARE ROUND THE GOLDEN SUN.
WE ARE A BILLION CHILDREN ROLDING TO ONE.
WHAT WILL I THINK OF ME, THE DAY THAT I DIE.
SALTWATET WELLS IN MY EYES 2X  1X GITAAR.
