I'M RIDING IN YOU'RE CAR

I SAY I DON'T LOVE YOU
BUT YOU KNOW I'M A LIERE
'CAUSE WHEN WE KISS  OEH  ------- FIRE

YOU HAD A HOLD ON ME , RIGHT FROM THE START
UP WRAPPEND SO TIGHT ,I COULD'NT TEAR IT APART
MY NERVES ALL JUMPING AND I LIKE TME ONE
WELL YOUR KISSES ARE BURN ,BUT MY HEART STAY'S COOL

BUT MY WORDS SAY LIES
'CAUSE WHEN WE KISS  OEH  ------- FIRE
