


        Five Minutes more

Give me five min-utes more , only five min-utes more
Let me stay , let my stay , in your arms

Here am I beg-ging for , only five min-utes more
Only five min-utes more , of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Satur-day date
Don't you know that Sunday morning  ,You can sleep late
