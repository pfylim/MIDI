Do you love me, too?
I love you

The sky`s blue, the water`s blue, too
my baby is walking away
I love the blue into, 
a fuckin` day

She feels good and she feels sorry
for me, she tells me: Honey, don`t worry!
But I`m so confused, my baby`s walking, 
walking away, walking away

It don`t mean nothing to me, 
yeah, don`t mean nothing to me, stay

Think about the wild, wild days
don`t you feel like I feel
about the wild, wild days
oh, is it a dream, is it true
about the wild, wild days.

Sitting in the middle of the battlefield,
my baby`s walking away
All the rooms, we could have been here, but
my baby`s walking away

I brought you flowers, I boughted your bread
I washed your car, would you remember, you said
that you would love me till the end and now you`re
walking away, walking away

It don`t mean nothing to me, 
yeah, don`t mean nothing to me, stay

I think about the wild, wild days
don`t you feel like I feel
about the wild, wild days
oh, is it a dream, is it true
about the wild, wild days.

To late, it`s time for you to wake up
she don`t need flowers, only diamonds and makeup
So sorry, but now she`s on my mind, my mind.

Talk
about the wild, wild days
don`t you feel like I feel
about the wild, wild days
is it a dream, is it true
about the wild, wild days.

Talk
about the wild, wild days
don`t you feel like I feel
about the wild, wild days
is it a dream, is it true
about the wild, wild days.
Don`t steel yourself away, oh no.
