Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love

Walking over clouds of love, flying high up through the sky with
you.
I`m falling down back to the ground, if you tell me, that you`re
leaving.
At the sunrise in your heart, can`t you see, you`ve got the truth
in you.
Let us celebrate the love, the love, that we are feeling.

Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love 
Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love

Everybody needs love. Everybody wants love.

Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love

Walking over clouds of love, flying high up through the sky with
you.
I`m falling down back to the ground, if you tell me, that you`re
leaving.
At the sunrise in your heart, can`t you see, you`ve got the truth
in you.
Let us celebrate the love, the love, that we are feeling.

Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love 
Celebrate the love
Celebrate the love
