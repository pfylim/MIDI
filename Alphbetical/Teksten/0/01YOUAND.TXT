I lose control because of you babe
I lose control, when you look atme like this
There`s something in your eyes that is sayin` tonight
I`m not a child anymore, life has opened the door
to a new exciting life

It`s all written down in your lifelines
It`s written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
to find our love a place,
where we can hide away.
You and I were just made
to love each other now
forever and a day.

I lose control because of you babe
I lose control, when you look at me like this
There`s somthing in your eyes
that is sayin` tonight.
I`m so curious for more, just like never before
in my innocent life.

It`s all written down in your lifelines
It`s written down inside your heart

You and I just have a dream
to find our love a place,
where we can hide away.
You and I were just made
to love each other now
forever and a day.

Time stands still 
When the days of innocence are falling for the night.
I love you girl, I always will
I swear, I`m there for you,
till the day I`ll die.

You and I just have a dream
to find our love a place,
where we can hide away.
You and I were just made
to love each other now
forever and a day.
You and I just have a dream ...
