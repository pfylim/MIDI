
    ENJOY YOURSELF              KYLIE MINOGUE

 Never let life
 Get you down
 When your head is spinning
 Feet won't touch the ground

 For in this world
 The good times you can't plan
 You'd better take your chances while you can

 Don't wait 'til tomorrow
 When you should be living today
 Enjoy yourself
 Before too long it's too late
 Don't throw the good times away
 Enjoy yourself
 Enjoy it

 Don't break up
 Inside
 When everything's too much
 Don't run and hide

 Don't wait 'til tomorrow
 When you should be living today
 Enjoy yourself
 Before too long it's too late
 Don't throw the good times away
 Enjoy yourself
 Enjoy it

 For nothing comes to those who hesitate
 Grab your dreams before it gets too late

 Don't wait 'til tomorrow
 When you should be living today
 Enjoy yourself
 Before too long it's too late
 Don't throw the good times away
 Enjoy yourself
 Enjoy it
 Enjoy it
