                And I love her                                      Beatles

I give her all my love , that's all I do
And if you saw my love , you'd love her to
I love her

She give me every thing , and tenderly
The kiss my love of mine , she brings to me
And I love her

     A love like ours , could never die
     As long as I , have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine , dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine ,  will never die 
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine , dark is the sky
I know this love of mine , will never die
And I love her

     A love like ours , could never die
     As long as I , have you near me
