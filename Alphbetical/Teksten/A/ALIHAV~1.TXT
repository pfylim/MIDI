*** ALL I HAVE TO DO IS DREAM **

WHEN I WANT YOU  , IN MY ARMS
WHEN I WANT YOU  , AND OLL YOUR CHARMS
WHEN EVER I WANT YOU ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DREAM ---   DREAM DREAM DREAM

WHEN I FEEL BLUE  , IN THE NIGHT
AND I NEED YOU  , TO HOLD ME TIGHT
WHEN EVER I WANT YOU ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DREAM -----

I CAN MAKE YOU MINE
TASTE YOUR LIPS OF WINE
ANYTIME NIGHT OR DAY
ONLY TROUBLE IS , GEE WISH
I'M DREAMING MY LIFE AWAY

I NEED YOU SO  , THAT I COULD DIE
I LOVE YOU SO  , AND THAT IS WHY
WHEN EVER I WANT YOU ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DREAM ------- DREAM DREAM DREAM 2X
