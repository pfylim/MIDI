AIN'T NO PLEASING YOU  CHAS AND DAVE

WEEL I BUILT MY LIFE AROUND YOU,
DID WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT
BUT YOU NEVER CARE ABOUT ME,
NOW I'VE SEEN THE LIGHT'
OH DARLIN', THERE AINT NO PLEASING YOU

YOU SEEMED TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING
I EVER DID WAS WRONG
I SHOULD HAVE KNOW IT ALL ALONG
OH DARLIN', THERE AINT NO PLEASING YOU

YOU ONLY HAD TO SAY THE WORD
AND YOU KNEW I DO IT
YOU HAD ME WHERE YOU WANTED ME,
BUT YOU WENT AND BLEW IT
NOW EVERYTHING, I EVER DONE'
WAS ONLY DONE FOR YOU, BUT NOW YOU CAN,
GO AND DO, JUST WHAT  YOU WANNA DO ,
I'M TELLING YOU

'COS I AINT GONNA BE MADE TO LOOK, A FOOL NO MORE,
YOU'VE DONE IT ONCE TOO OFTEN,
WHAT YOU TAKE ME FOR
OH DARLIN', THERE AINT NO PLEASING YOU

SOLO 1X

YOU ONLY HAD TO SAY ENZ

NOW IF YOU THINK I DON'T MEAN WHAT I SAY,
AND I'M ONLY BLUFFING,

I'M TELLING THAT YOU FOR NOTHING
OH DARLING THERE AINT NO PLEASING YOU
