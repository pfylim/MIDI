** ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE*EVERLY BROTHERS*A*WP05

OH WHEN I LOVE
I GET THE FEVERS LIKE I'M TRAVELLING THROUGH THE SKY
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
AS I RIDE
MY HEAD IS WEAVING BUT I DON'T EVEN WONDER WHY
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE I'LL FLY

I'LL GO LAND AND SEA
I'LL BE THINKING OF YOU AND ME
COULD'NT ASK FOR A BETTER PLACE TO BE
OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING
OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING
OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING TO ME

SO HOLD MY HANDS
I'VE GOT YHE FEELING THAT THE DIRTY HAD MUST BE DONE
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
AND IF WE LIKE
WE'LL FLY TOGETHER TO THE LAND OF THE PURPLE SUN
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE

REFREIN

OH WHEN I LOVE 
I GET THE FEVERS LIKE I TRAVELLING THROUGH THE SKY
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
ON THE WING OF A NIGHTINGALE  ( FLY-----)
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHT-IN-GALE
