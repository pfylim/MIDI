TELL ME WHY YOU KEEP FOOLING, LITTLE COQUETTE
MAKING FUN OF THE ONES WHO LOVE YOU

BREAKING HEARTS YOU ARE RULING, LITTLE COQUETTE
TRUE HEARTS, TENDERLY DREAMING OF YOU



SOME DAY YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE
AS I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
MAYBE SOMEONE YOU LOVE WILL JUST BE FOOLING



AND WHEN YOU 'RE ALL ALONE WITH ONLY REGRET
YOU 'LL KNOW, LITTLE COQUETTE I LOVED YOU
