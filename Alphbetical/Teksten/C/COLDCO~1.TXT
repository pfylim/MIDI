              COLD COLD HEART  HANK WILLIAMS

I TRIED SO HARD MY DEAR TO SHOW
THAT YOU'RE MY EVERY DREAM
YET YOU'RE AFRAID EACH THING I DO
IS JUST SOME EVIL SCHEME
A MEM'RY FROM YOUR LONESOME PAST
KEEPS US SO FAR APART

   WHY CAN'T YOU FREE YOUR DOUBTFULL MIND
   AND MELT YOUR COLD COLD HEART

ANOTHER LOVE BEFORE MY TIME
MADE YOUR HEART SAD AND BLUE
AND SO MY HEART IS PAYING NOW
FOR THINGS I DIDN'T DO
IN ANGERY UNKIND WORDS WERE SAID
THAT MADE THE TEARDROPS START

   REFREIN

SOLO

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I BELIEVED
THAT YOU BELONGED TO ME
BUT NOW I KNOW YOUR HEART IS SHACKELD
TO A MEMORY
THE MORE I LEARN TO CARE FOR YOU
THE MORE WE DRIFT APART

REFR.
