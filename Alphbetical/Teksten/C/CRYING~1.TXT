WALK RIGHT BACK  
1X SOLO  DAARNA INVALLEN
CRYING IN THE RAIN
I'LL NEVER LET YOU SEE
THE WAY MY BROKEN HEART IS HURTING ME
I'VE GOT MY PRIDE, AND I KNOW HOW TO HIDE
ALL MY SORROW AND PAIN
I.LL DO MY CRYING IN THE RAIN

IF I WAIT FOR CLOUDY SKIES
YOU WON'T KNOW THE RAIN FROM MY TEARS IN MY  EYES
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW THAT I STILL LOVEW YOU SO
THOUGH THE HEART TACHES REMAIN
I'LL DO MY CRYING IN THE RAIN
  
RAINDROPS FALLIN' FROM HEAVEN
COULD NEVER WISH AWAY MY MISERY
BUT SINCE WE'RE NOT TOGETHER
I LOOK FOR STORMY WEATHER
TO HIDE THIS TEARS I HOPE YOU NEVER SEEN

SOMEDAY WHEN MY CRYING'S DONE
I' GONNA WEAR A SMILE AND WALK IN THE SUN
I'L MAY BE A FOOL BUT TILL THEN DARLIN YOU
NEVER SEE ME COMPLAIN
I'LL DO MY CRYING IN THE RAIN 3X
