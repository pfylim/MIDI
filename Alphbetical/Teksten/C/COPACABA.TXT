HER NAME WAS LOLA,SHE WAS A SHOWGIRL.
WITH YELLOW FEATHERS IN HER HAIR AND A DRESS CUT DOWN TO THERE.
SHE WOULD MERENQUE AND DO THE CHA CHA,
AND WHILE SHE TRIED TO BE A STAR,TONY ALWAYS TENDED BAR.
ACROSS THE SROWDED FLOOR THEY WORKED FROM EIGHT TO FOUR.
THEY WERE YOUNG AND THEY HAD EACH OTHER,WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE.

AT THE COPA,COPACABANA,THE HOTTEST SPOT NORTH OF HAVANA.
AT THE COPA,COPACABANA,MUSIC AND PASSION WERE ALWAYS THE FASHION.

HIS NAME WAR RICO;HE WORE A DIAMOND.
HE WAS ESCORTED TO HIS CHAIR,HE SAW LOLA DANCING THERE
AND WHEN SHE FINISHED,HE CALLED HER OVER.
BUT RICO WENT A BIT TOO FAR,TONY SAILDED ACROSS THE BAR.
AND THEN THE PUNCHES FLEW AND CHAIRS WERE SMACHED IN TWO.
