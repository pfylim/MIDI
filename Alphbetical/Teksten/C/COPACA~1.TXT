            Copacabana 


Her name was Lola
She was a showgirl
With yellow feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would marengue
And do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor
They worked from eight fo four
They were young and the had each other
Who could ask for more?

At the copa-copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
At the copa-copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa they fellin' love.

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair
He saw Lola dancin' there
And when she finished
He called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew
And chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gunshot
But just who shot who?

At the copa-copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
At the copa-copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa, she lost her love.

Her name is Lola
She was a showgirl
But that was thirty years ago
When they used to have a show
Now it's a disco
But not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined
And drinks herself half blind
She lost her yough and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind.


At the copa-copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
At the copa-copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion
At the copa don't fall in love.
