** CATHY'S CLOWN ***** EVERLY BROTHERS ** *WP05

DON'T WANT YOUR LOVE ----- ANYMORE
DON'T WANT YOUR KISSES --- THAT'S FOR SURE
I DIE EACH TIME -- I HEAR THIS SOUND
HERE HE COMES --- THAT'S CATHY'S CLOWN

I'VE GOT TO STAND TALL
YOU KNOW A MAN CAN'T CRAWL
FOR WHEN HE KNOWS YOU TELL LIES
AND HE LETS THEM PASS BY
THEN HE'S NOT A MAN AT ALL

REFREIN

WHEN YOU SEE ME SHED A TEAR
AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S SINCERE
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S KIND OF SAD
THAT YOU'RE TREATING ME SO SAD
OR DON'T YOU EVEN CARE

REFREIN
