YOU 'RE MY BEST FRIEND              - DON WILLIAMS -    D
                   (Wayland Holyfield)

YOU PLACE GOLD ON MY FINGERS
YOU BROUGHT LOVE, LIKE I 'VE NEVER KNOWN
YOU GAVE LIFE TO OUR CHILDREN
AND TO ME A REASON TO GO ON

	YOU 'RE MY BREAD WHEN I 'M HUNGRY
	YOU 'RE MY SHELTER FROM TROUBLE WIND
	YOU 'RE MY ANCHOR IN LIFE 'S OCEAN
	BUT MOST OF ALL, YOU 'RE MY BEST FRIEND

WHEN I NEED HOPE AND INSPIRTATION
YOU 'RE ALWAYS STRONG, WHEN I 'M TIRED AND WEAK
I COULD SEARCH THIS WHOLE WORLD OVER
YOU 'D STILL BE EVERYTHING THAT I NEED
