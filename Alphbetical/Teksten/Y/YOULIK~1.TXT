THOUGH YOU'RE GONNA  AWAY THIS MORNING
YOU'LL BE BACK AGAIN TONIGHT
TELLING ME THERE 'LL BE NO NEXT TIME
IF I JUST DON'T TREAT YOU RIGHT

YOU'LL NEVER LEAVE  ME AND YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
CAUSE YOU LIKE ME TOO MUCH AND I LIKE YOU

YOU'VE TRIED BEFORE TO LEAVE ME
BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE NERVE
TO WALK OUT AND MAKE ME LONELEY
WICH IS ALL THAT I DESERVE

I REALLY DO, AND IT'S NICE WHEN YOU BELIEVE ME
IF YOU LEAVE ME

I WILL FOLLOW YOU AND BRING YOU BACK
WHERE YOU BELONG
CAUSE I COULDN'T REALLY STAND IT
I ADMIT THAT I WAS WRONG

       SOLO                     CAUSE YOU LIKE ME ENZ.
