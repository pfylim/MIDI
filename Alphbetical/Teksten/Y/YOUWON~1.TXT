   YOU WON'T SEE ME   THE BEATLES

WHEN I CALL YOU UP, YOU'RE LINES ENGAGED
I HAVE HAD, ENOUGH, SO I ACT YOUR AGE
WE HAVE LOST, THE TIME, THAT WAS SO HARD TO FIND'
AND I WILL LOSE, MY MIND,
IF YOU WON'T SEE ME  (YOU WON'T SEE ME) 
YOU WON'T SEE ME       (YOU WON'T SEE ME)

I DON,T KNOW, WHY YOU, SHOULD WON'T TO HIDE
BUT I CAN'T, GET THROUGH, MY HANDS ARE TIED
I DON'T WANT, TO STAY, I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY
BUT I CAN TURN AWAY, 
AND YOU WON'T SEE ME (YOU WON'T SEE ME)
YOU WON'T SEE ME           (YOU WON'T SEE  ME)
      
TIME AFTER TIME, YOU REFUSE TO EVEN LISTEN
I WOULDN'T MIND IF I KNEW WHAT I WAS MISSING

THOUGH THE DAY'S, ARE FEW, THEY'RE FILLED WITH TEARS
AND SINCE I, LOST YOU, IT FEELS LIKE YEARS
YES IT SEEMS, SO LONG, GIRL SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE
AND I JUST, CAN'T GO ON
IF YOU WON'T SEE ME ( YOU WON'T SEE ME)
YOU WON'T SEE ME      ( YOU WON'T SEE ME)

TIME AFTER TIME ENZ
