STEVE WALKS WARILY DOWN THE STREET.
WITH THE BRIM PULLED WAY DOWN LOW.
AIN'T NO SOUND,BUT THE SOUND OF HIS FEET.
MACHINE GUNS READY TO GO.
ARE YOU READY,HEY! ARE YOU READY FOR THIS.     C-G-Am-B
ARE YOU HANGING ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
OUT OF THE DOORWAY THE BULLETS RIP TO THE SOUND OF THE BEAT
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
AND ANOTHER ONE GONE,AND ANOTHER ONE GONE.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
HEY! I'M GONNA GET YOU TOO.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
                                modulatie Am
HOW DO YOU THINK I'M GOING.   
TO GET ALONE WITHOUT YOU WHEN YOU'RE GONE.
YOU TOOK ME FOR E'VRYTHING THAT I HAD,
AND KICKED ME OUT ON MY OWN.
ARE YOU HAPPY, ARE YOU SATISFIED.             F-C-Dm-E
HOU LONG CAN YOU STAND THE HEAT.
OUT OF THE DOORWAY THE BULLETS RIP TO THE SOUND OF THE BEAT
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
AND ANOTHER ONE GONE,AND ANOTHER ONE GONE.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST.
HEY! I'M GONNA GET YOU TOO.
ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST
