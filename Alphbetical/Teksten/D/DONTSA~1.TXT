      DON'T SAY GOOD BYE

IF YOU SHOULD GO AND SAY GOOD BYE
HOW CAN I KNOW IT AIN'T A LIE
I LOVE YOU SO BAD, IT'S DRIVING ME MAD
DON'T SAY GOOD BYE.


IF YOU SHOULD SAY, THAT WE SHOULD PART I KNOW IT MAY
 BREAK THIS OLD HEART  JUST STAY IN MY ARMS
MAKE ME FEEL YOUR CHARMS
DON'T SAY GOOD BYE



I WANT TO LIVE WITH YOU BY MY SIDE
ALL I CAN THINK OF IS HOLDING YOU SO TIGHT



SO STAY HERE WITH ME, DON'T MAKE ME CRY
OR YOU WILL SEE WITHOUT YOU I'LL DIE
I WON'T LET YOU GO CAUSE I LOVE YOU SO
DON'T SAY GOOD BYE.
