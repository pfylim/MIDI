Don't  make me brown eyes Blue      From   Nashville   Vol 1


Don't now when , I've been
Don't no what's come over
You've found someone 
And don't it make me brown eyes blue

I'll be fine when you're
I'll just cry all night
Say it isn't 
And don't it make me brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets , tell me some
Give me no reason , give me all
Tell me you love me and don't let me
Say anything but don't say 
I didn't mean to treat you
Didn't know just what I
But honey now I
And don't it make me brown eyes
And don't it make me brown eyes
And don't it make me brown eyes blue
