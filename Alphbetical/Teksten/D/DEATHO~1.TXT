
      THE DEATH OF A  CLOWN DAVE DAVIS

MY MAKE UP IS DRY AND IT 
CRACKS ON MY CHIN
I'M DRAWING MY SORROW'S, 
IN WHISKY AND GIN

THE LIGHT-DIMERS WHIPPED, 
DOESN'T  CRACK ANYMORE
THE LIONS THEY WON'T FIGHT'
AND THE TIGERS WON'T ROAR

LALALALALAL ENZ.
SO LET'S GO DRINK  TO THE DEATH 
OF A CLOWN
WANT SOMEONE HELP ME
TO BREAK UP THIS CROWED
LET'S ALL DRINK TO THE DEATH
OF A CLOWN
LALALALALAL ENZ
LET'S ALL DRINK TO THE DEATH 
OF A CLOWN

THE OLD FORTUNE TELL HER  LIES,
TRICK ON THE FLOOR
NOBODY NEEDS FOR  TO,
TO STOLE ANYMORE
THE TRAINER OF HIM TAKES HIS,
CROPS ON HIS KNEES
AND FEARS TO BE LOOKIN' FOR'
RUNAWAY FREE

REFR

2 MATEN AFWACHTEN

DAN LALALAL.
