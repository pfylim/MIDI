SOMETIMES A MAN MIGHT WANNA CRY
SOMETIMES A MAN MIGHT WANNA DIE

HE WON'T LIVE LIFE HE'S STANDING ALL ALONE
IT'S CAUSE HE'S GOT NO LOVE TO CALL HIS OWN

SOMETIMES WHEN I FEEL OH SO SAD
SOMETIMES A MAN IS HURT SO BAD

HE WON'T LIVE LIFE, HE'S FEELING SAD AND CRIES
IT'S CAUSE HE'S GOT NO LOVE TO DRY HIS EYES

IT'S CAUSE HE'S GOT NO LOVE TO STAND ASIDE

HE GIVE'S THE WORLD TO KNOW SOMEONE CARES FOR HIM
