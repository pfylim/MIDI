** HERE IT COMES AGAIN ** THE FOTUNES ** *WP10

WHEN I SEE THAT GIRL GO WALKING BY
I KNOW BOYS SHOUL'ND CRY
HERE IT COMES AGAIN , THAT FEELING
HERE IT COMES AGAIN

WHEN I SEE HERE LOOK INTO HER EYES
NO MATHER HOW I TRY
HERE IT COMES AGAIN , THAT FEELING
HERE IT COMES AGAIN

*********************************************
I FIND MY CRY.....ING OVER YOU              *
I'LL KNOW IT'S NOT THE THING TO DO...OE     * 
                                            *
NOW I'M ON MY ONE I WALK ALONE              * REFREIN
A HEART WITHOUT A HOME                      *
HERE IT COMES AGAIN , THAT FEELING          *
HERE IT COMES AGAIN                         *
*********************************************

WHEN LOVE WALK'T OUT , IF I WENT OUT 
INSIDE OF ME
THEY PUT IT OUT THOSE TEARS INSIDE OF ME

THAT IS NOT SO HART FOR ME TO SAY
(WHEN YOU SAD) YOU MUST FIND
YOU KNOW,YOU KNOW,YOU KNOW,YOU BROKE MY HEART
HERE IT COMES AGAIN , THAT FEELING
HERE IT COMES AGAIN

REFREIN
