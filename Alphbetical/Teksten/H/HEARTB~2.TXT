HEARTBEAT,  WHY DO YOU MISS
WHEN MY BABY KISSES ME.
HEARTBEAT,  WHY DOES A LOVE KISS
STAY IN MY MEMORY.
RIDDLE-DEE-PAT,   I KNOW THAT NEW LOVE THRILLS ME.
I KNOW THAT TRUE LOVE WILL BE....
HEARTBEAT,  WHY DO YOU MISS 
WHEN MY BABY KISSES ME.


HEARTBEAT, WHY DO YOU SKIP 
WHEN MY BABY'S LIPS MEET MINE.
HEARTBEAT, WHY DO YOU FLIP 
THEN GIVE ME A SKIP-BEAT SIGN.
RIDDLE-DEE-PAT,  AND SING TO ME LOVE'S STORY.
AND BRING TO ME LOVE'S GLORY....
HEARTBEAT, WHY DO YOU MISS
WHEN MY BABY KISSE ME.

SOLO

RIDDLE-DEE-PAT,  I KNOW THAT NEW LOVE THRILLS ME.
I KNOW THAT TRUE LOVE WILL BE...
HEARTBEAT,  WHY DO YOU MISS
WHEN MY BABY KISSES ME
