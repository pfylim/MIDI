    Tell Laura I love her         

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laura I need her
Tell Laura I may-be late
I,ve some-thing to do , that can-not wait

He drove his car to the racing grounds
He was the young-est driver there
The crowd roared as they start-ed the race
Round the track they drove at a dead-ly pace
No one knows what hap-pened that day
How his car over turned in flames
But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck
With his dying breath they heard him say

Tell Laura I love her
Tell Laure I need her
Tell Laura not to cry
My love for her , will never die
