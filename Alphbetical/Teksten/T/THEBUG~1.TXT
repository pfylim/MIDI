SOMETIMES YOU'RE A WINDMACHINE
SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE BUG
SOMETIMES IT ALL COMES TOGETHER BABY
SOMETIMES YOU'RE A FOOL IN LOVE
SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE LOUISVILLE SLUGGER
SOMETIMES YOU'RE THE BALL
SOMETIMES IT ALL COMES TOGETHER BABY
SOMETIMES YOU'RE GONNA LOOSING IT ALL

BEFORE WE CAN SAY GOODBYE,...BECAUSE:  REFREIN:SOLO
