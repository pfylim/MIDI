THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE  THE EVERLY BROTHERS

AND WHEN I LOVE , I GET THE FEELING
LIKE I'M TRAVELIN' THROUGH THE SKY, 
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE

AND AS I RIDE, MY HEAD IS BEATING
BUT I DON'T EVEN WONDER WHY
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE, I FLY

    HIGH ABOVE,  LAND AND SEA
    I'LL BE THINKING OF, YOU AND ME
    COULDN'T ASK  FOR A BETTER PLACE TO BE
    OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING,
    OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING,
    OH I CAN FEEL SOMETHING HAPPENING, TO ME 

SO HOLD MY HAND, I'VE GOT THE FEELING
THAT THE JOURNY HAS JUST BEGUN,
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE

AND IF YOU LIKE, WE'LL FLY TOGETHER
TO THE LAND OF ETERNAL SUN,
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTIGALE, OF LOVE

    HIGH ABOVE ENZ.

WHEN I LOVE, I GET THE FEELING
LIKE I'M TRAVELIN' THROUGH THE SKY
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHTINGALE  AHAHAHAH
ON THE WINGS OF A NIGHT-TING- GALE
