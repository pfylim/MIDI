

    ÅTHE HEART THAT YOU OWN        (DWIGHT YOAKAM)


I PAY RENT ON A RUN-DOWN PLACE
THERE AIN'T NO VIEW, BUT THERE 'S LOTS OF SPACE
IN MY HEART, THE HEART THAT YOU OWN
I PAY THE RENT, PAY IT RIGHT ON TIME
BABY I PAY YOU EVERY SINGLE DIME
FOR MY HEART, THE HEART THAT YOU OWN


USED TO BE I COULD LOVE HERE FOR FREE
WAY BACK BEFORE YOU BOUGHT THE PROPERTY
NOW I PAY DAILY ON WHAT ONCE WAS MINE
LORD I PROBABLY OWE YOU FOR THESE TEARS THAT I CRY



CAUSE I PAY THE RENT ON A RUN-DOWN PLACE
THERE AIN'T NO VIEW, BUT THERE 'S LOTS OF SPACE
IN MY HEART, THE HEART THAT YOU OWN

                SOLO

I STRUGGLE EACH NIGHT TO FIND A NEW WAY
TO PAY WHAT I OWE, JUST SO I CAN STAY
I AIN'T OVERDUE SO YOU CAN'T THROW ME OUT
I 'VE LOVED HERE FOR YEARS, DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO NOW

CAUSE I PAY RENT ON A RUN-DOWN PLACE
THERE AIN'T NO VIEW, BUT THERE 'S LOTS OF SPACE
IN MY HEART, THE HEART THAT YOU OWN
YEAH, IN MY HEART, THE HEART THAT YOU OWN.
