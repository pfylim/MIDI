A THING CALLED LOVE           - JOHNNY CASH -            C
           (J. Hubbard)

SIX FOOT SIX HE STOOD ON THE GROUND
HE WEIGHED TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIVE POUNDS
BUT I SAW THAT GIANT OF A MAN BROUGHT DOWN 
TO HIS KNEES BY LOVE

HE WAS THE KIND OF MAN THAT WOULD GAMBLE ON LOVE
LOOK YOU IN THE EYE AND NEVER BACK UP
BUT I SAW HIM CRYING LIKE A LITTLE WHIPPED PUP
BECAUSE OF LOVE

	YOU CAN'T SEE IT WITH YOUR EYES
	HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND
	BUT LIKE THE WIND IT COVERS OUR LAND
	STRONG ENOUGH TO RULE THE HEART OF ANY MAN 
	THIS THING CALLED LOVE
	IT CAN LIFT YOU UP, NEVER LET YOU DOWN
	TAKE YOUR WORLD AND TURN IT ALL AROUND
	EVER SINCE TIME NOTHING 'S EVER BEEN FOUND
	THAT 'S STRONGER THAN LOVE

MOST MEN ARE LIKE ME THEY STRUGGLE IN DOUBT
THEY WORRY THEIR MINDS DAY IN AND DAY OUT
TOO BUSY WITH LIVING TO WORRY ABOUT 
A LITTLE WORD LIKE LOVE

BUT WHEN I SEE A MOTHER 'S TENDERNESS
AS SHE HOLDS HER YOUNG CLODE TO HER BREAST
THEN I THANK GOD THAT THE WORLD 'S BEEN BLESSED
WITH A THING CALLED LOVE
