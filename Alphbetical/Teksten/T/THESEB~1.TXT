
    THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN'         (  Hazlewood)  (4-66)


YOU KEEP SAYIN' YOU GOT SOMETHIN' FOR ME
SOMETHIN' YOU CALL LOVE BUT CONFESS
YOU BEEN MESSIN' WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE MESSIN'
AND NOW SOMEONE ELSE IS GETTIN' ALL YOUR BEST


THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN' AND THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY'LL DO
ONE OF THESE DAYS THESE BOOTS
ARE GONNA WALK ALL OVER YOU


YOU KEEP LYIN' WHEN YOU OUGHTA BE "TRUTHIN"
YOU KEEP LOSIN' WHEN YOU OUGHTA NOT BET
YOU KEEP "SAME-IN" WHEN YOU OUGHTA BE CHANGIN'
NOW WHAT'S RIGHT IS RIGHT, BUT YOU AIN'T BEEN RIGHT YET

YOU KEEP PLAYIN' WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T BE PLAYIN'
YOU KEEP THINKIN' THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET BURNED
I JUST FOUND ME A BRANDNEW BOX OF MATCHES
AND WHAT SHE (HE) KNOWS YOU AIN'T GOT TIME TO LEARN
