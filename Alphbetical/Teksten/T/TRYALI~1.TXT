       Try a little kindness                       From Nashville Vol. 1

If you see your brother standing by
Whit a heavy  load , from the seed's he's
And if your sister falling by her
Just stop and see : Your going 

You gotte try a little kind
Yeah show a little kind
Yust shine  your light   for every'one to
And if you try a little kind
Then you'll overlook the blindness of 
Reminded people , on their narrow minded

Don't walk around the down and
Lend a helping hand , in'stead
And the kindness that you show every
Well help some'one along their

Refrein : You' ve gotte enz.
