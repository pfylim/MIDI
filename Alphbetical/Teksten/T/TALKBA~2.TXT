Talk  back tremblin' lips , shaky legs don't just stand there
Don't let her know that she's gettin' through to you
Talk back tremblin' lips , burning eyes don't start cryin'
Heart don't let her know , that you breakin' in two


Every day our love's a battle on ye
Dear it seems that fighting is all we do
But if i let you know how much i love you
You'd do things to me you shouldn 't do , so


Every time you up and hurt my feelings
I pretend that couldn 't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions
Behind my broken heart I guess , so
