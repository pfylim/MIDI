That'll be the day                      Buddy Holly

Well you give me all your lovin'
And your turty dovin
All your hugs an'kisses an' your money too
Well you know you love me baby
Until you tell me may'be
That some day  well I'll be through

Well :
That'll be the day , when you say goodbye
Yes :
That'll be the day  , when you make me cry
Ah you say you're gonna leave
You know it's a lie 'cause
That'll be the day when I die well

When Cupis shot his dart
He shot it al your heart
So if we ever part and I leave you
You say you told me an' you told me boldly
That some day well I'll be trought  Well
