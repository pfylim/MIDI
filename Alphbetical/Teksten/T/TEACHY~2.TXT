     ÅTEACH YOUR CHILDREN        (G. Nash)


YOU, WHO ARE ON THE  ROAD, MUST HAVE A   CODE
THAT YOU CAN  LIVE BY
AND SO BECOME YOUR-  SELF
BECAUSE THE  PAST IS JUST A   GOODBYE

TEACH YOUR CHILDREN  WELL
THAT FATHER'S   HELL WILL SLOWLY  GO BY
AND  FEED THEM ON YOUR  DREAMS
THE ONE THEY  PITCH,   THE ONE YOU'LL  KNOW BY

DON'T YOU EVER ASK THEM  WHY
IF THEY TOLD YOU YOU WOULD  CRY
SO JUST LOOK AT THEM AND  SIGH
AND KNOW THEY  LOVE YOU

AND  YOU   (CAN YOU HEAR)    OF TENDER  YEARS  (DO YOU CARE)
CAN'T KNOW THE  FEARS      (THAT YOU SEE)
THAT YOUR ELDERS  GREW BY  (MUST BE FREE TO)
( AND  FEED  TEACH YOUR CHILDREN)    THEM ON YOUR  DREAMS
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN)    THEY SEEK THE  TRUTH
(BREAK AWAY AND)    BEFORE THEY  CAN DIE
 (WE CAN LIVE IN PEACE)
TEACH YOUR PARENTS  WELL, THAT CHILDREN'S  HELL
DID SLOWLY  GO BY
AND  SO BECOME YOUR-  SELF, BECAUSE THE  PAST
IS JUST A   GOODBYE

DON'T YOU EVER ASK THEM WHY   ENZ.
