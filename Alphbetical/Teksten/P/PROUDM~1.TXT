LEFT A GOOD JOB IN THE CITY
WORKIN FOR THE MAN EV'RY NIGHT AND DAY
AND I NEVER LOST ONE MINUTE OF SLEEPIN'
WORRYIN 'BOUT THE WAY THINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN

PROUD MARY KEEP ON BURNIN'           ] REFREIN
ROLLIN..ROLLIN.. ROLLIN ON THE RIVER ]

CLEANED A LOT OF PLATES IN MEPHIS
PUMPED A LOT OF PAIN DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS
BUT I NEVER SAW THE GOOD SIDE OF THE CITY
UNTIL I HITCHED A RIDE ON A RIVERBOAT QUEEN
 
REFREIN

INTRO...SOLO...INTRO

IF YOU COME DOWN TO THE RIVER
BET YOU GONNA FIND SOME PEOPLE WHO LIVE
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.'CAUS YOU HAVE NO MONEY
PEOPLE ON THE RIVER ARE HAPPY TO GIVE

REFREIN

INTRO
