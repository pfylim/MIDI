        PAPER ROSES    DIV. ARTIESTEN

I REALISE THE WAY YOU'RE EYES DECIEVED ME
WITH TENDER LOOKS THAT I MISTOKE FOR LOVE
SO TAKE AWAY THE FLOWERS THAT YOU BOUGHT ME
AND SEND THE KIND THAT YOU REMIND ME ON

     PAPER ROSES PAPER ROSES
     OH HOW REAL THOSE ROSES SEEMED TO BE
     BUT THEY'RE ONLY IMMITATION
     LIKE YOU'RE IMMITATION LOVE FOR ME

I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD BE A PERFECT LOVER
YOU SEEMED SO FULL OF SWEETNES AT THE START
BUT LIKE THAT BIG RED ROSE THAT'S MADE OF PAPER
THERE ISN'T ANY SWEETNES IN YOU'RE HEAERT

   REFR.
