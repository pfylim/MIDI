Under your  spell again          From Nashville   Vol. 1

You've got me under your spell a
Say'in those things a
Makin' me believe that you're just
You've got me dreamin those dreams a
Think'in those things a
Ive gotta  take you back just one more

Well I swore the last that you
That I wouldn't see you if came a
But I can't tell my heart wath't
And I've been so lonely since you've  gone

Refrein :

Well every'body tells me that I'm a
That I should have never put my faith
Way down deep in I guess I know it's
No one else can make me feel the way
