Oh my love , my darling .
 I,ve  hungered for your touch.
Along , lonely time.
Time goes by .
So slowly and time can do so much.
Are you still mine.
I need your love , I need your love.
God  speed your love , to me.

Lone - ly rivers flow , to the sea  , to the sea.
To the open arms , of the sea.
Love - ly rivers sigh , wath for me , wait for me.
I,ll becoming home , wait for me.
