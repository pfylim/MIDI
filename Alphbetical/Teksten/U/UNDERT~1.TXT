         Under the boardwalk


Oh when the sun beats down 
And burns the up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot you wish
Your  tired feet were fire proof


Under the boardwalk , down by the sea yeah
On a blanket with my baby's , where I'll be

Under the boardwalk , out of the sun
Under the boardwalk , well be havin some fun
Under the boardwalk , people walkin a bove
Under the boardwalk , we'll be fall in love
Under the boardwalk , boardwalk

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can al most taste the 
Hot dogs  and french fries they sell

Refrein :
