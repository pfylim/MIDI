****** WHISKY IN THE JAR *** THE DUBLINERS *** 3H92
      ----------------------------------------
AS I WAS GOING OVER THE FAR FAMED KERRY MOUNTAINS.
I MET WITH CAPTAIN FARRELL AND HIS MONEY HE WAS COUNTING.
I FIRST PRODUCED MY PISTOL AND THEN I PRODUCED MY RAPIER.
SAYING "STAND AND DELIVER FOR YOU ARE MY BOLD DECEIVER.

============================================
WITH YOUR WHACK FOL THE DIDDLE FOL THE DAY.=
WHACK FOL THE DIDDLE O                     = CHORUS
WHACK FOL THE DIDDLE O                     =
THERE'S WHISKY IN THE JAR                  =
============================================

HE COUNTED OUT HIS MONEY AND IT MADE A PRETTY PENNY,
I PUT IT IN MY POCKED AND I GAVE IT TO MY JENNY,
SHE SIGHED AND SHE SWORE THAT SHE NEVER WOULD DECIEVE ME,
BUT THE DEVIL TAKE THE WOMAN FOR THEY NEVER CAN BE EASY.

CHORUS

I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER FOR TO TAKE A SLIMBER,
I DREAMT OF GOLD AND JEWELS AND SURE IT WAS NO WONDER,
BUT JENNY TOOK MY JEWELS AND FILLED THEM UP WITH WATER,
AND SENT FOR CAPTAIN FARRELL TO BE READY FOR THE SLAUGHTER.

CHORUS

'TWAS EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE I ROSE TO TRAVEL,
THE GUARDS WERE ALL AROUND ME AND LIKEWIS CAPTAIN FARRELL.
I THEN PRODUCED MY PISTOL FOR SHE STOLE AWAY MY RAPIER,
BUT I COULD'NT SHOOT THE WATER ,SO A PRISONER I WAS TAKEN.

CHORUS

IF ANYONE CAN AID ME,IT'S MY BROTHER IN THE ARMY
I THINK THAT HE IS STATIONED IN CORK OR IN KILLARNEY
AND IF HE'D COME AND JOIN ME ,WE'D GO ROVIN' IN KILKENNY
I SWEAR HE'D TREAT ME FAIRER,THEN ME DARLING SPORTING JENNY

CHORUS  UIT
