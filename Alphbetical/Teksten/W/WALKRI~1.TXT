*** WALK RIGHT BACK **** EVERLY BROTHERS *D* WP04

I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHY YOU WALK OUT ON ME
I'M SO LOGSOME EVERYDAY
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT SINDS YOU WALK OUT ON ME
NOTHING SEEMS TO BE THAT SAME OLD WAY

THINK ABOUT THE LOVE THAT BURNS WHIT'IN MY HEART FOR YOU
THE GOOD TIMES WE HAD BEFORE YOU WENT AWAY ON ME

WALK RIGHT BACK TO ME THIS MINUTE
BRING YOUR LOVE TO MAKE ALL SUNDAY
I'M SO LONGSOME EVERDAY
