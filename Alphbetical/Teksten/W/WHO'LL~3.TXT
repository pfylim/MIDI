LONG AS I REMEMBER
THE RAIN BEEN GOMIM' DOWN
CLOUDS OF MYST'RY POURIN'
CONFUSION ON THE GROUND
GOODMAN THROUGH THE AGES
TRYIN' TO FIND THE SUN

AND I WONDER,STILL I WONDER  .WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN

I WENT DOWN VIRGINIA
SNEEKI' SHELTER FROM THE STORM
CAUGHT UP IN THE FABLE
I WATCHED THE TOWER GROW
FIVE YEARS PLANS AN A NEW DEAL
WRAPPED IN GOLD AN CHAINS
 
AND I WONDER, STILL I WONDER  .WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN

SOLO

HEARD THE SINGERS PLAYIN'
HOW WE CHEERED FOR MORE
THE GROWD HAD RUSHED TOGETHER
TRYIN' TO KEEP WARM
STILL THE RAIN KEPT POURIN'
FALLIN' ON MY EARS
 
AND I WONDER, STILL I WONDER  .WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN
