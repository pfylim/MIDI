      WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS     QUEEN

I PAID MY DUICE TIME AFTER TIME
I'VE DONE MY SENTIOUS, BUT COMMITED NO CRIME
AND BAD MISTAKES, I'VE MADE A VIEW
I'VE HAD MYSELF. AND KICK THEN MY FACE
BUT I COME THROUGH
(YOU'VE GOT A HOLD IT, HOLD IT HOLD IT HOLD)

WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND
AND WE'LL KEEP ON FIGHTING TILL THE END
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS
NO TIME FOR LOOSERS,
JUST WE ARE THE CHAMPIGNONS OF THE WORLD

I'VE TAKEN MY BOWS, AND MY CURTENCALLS
YOU BROUGHT MY FAMEAND FORTUNES,
END EVERY THING THAT GOES
I THANK YOU ALL, BUT IT'S BEEN NO BED OF ROSES
NO PLEASER CRUISES,I CONSIDERING IT CHALLANGE
TO BE FOLLOW HUMAN RACE
AND I NEVER LOOSE
(YOU'VE GOT A HOLD IT HOLD IT HOLD IT HOLD)

REFR 2X
