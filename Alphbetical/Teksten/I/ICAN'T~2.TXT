HOT SUN ... BEATING DOWN
BURNING MY FEET JUST WALKING AROUND
HOT SUN ... MAKING ME SWEAT
'GATORS GETTING CLOSE .. HASN'T GOT ME YET

THE ONLY THING ABOUT ME IS THE WAY I WALK
I CAN'T DANCE .. I CAN'T SING
I'M JUST STANDING HERE SELLING EVERYTHING

BLUE JEANS ... SITTING ON THE BEACH
HER DOGS TALKING TO ME .BUT SHE'S OUT OF REACH
SHE'S GOT A BODY UNDER THAT SHIRT
BUT ALL SHE WANT TO DO IS RUB MY FACE IN THE DIRT

YOUNG PUNK SPILLING BEER ON MY SHOES
FAT GUY'S TALKING TO ME TRYING TO STEAL MY BLUES
THICK SMOKE ,SEE HER SMILING THROUGH
I NEVER THOUGHT SO MUCH COULD HAPPEN JUST SHOOTIN POOL

BUT I CAN'T DANCE ... I CAN'T TALK
YHE ONLY THING ABOUT ME  IS THE WAY I WALK
