WE MUST HAVE BEEN STONE CRAZY
WHEN WE THOUGHT WE ARE FRIENDS
CAUSE I MISS YOU BABE
AND I GOT THOSE FEELINGS AGAIN
I QUESS I'M ALL CONFUSED ABOUT YOU
I FEEL SO IN LOVE OH BABE.....WHAT CAN I DO

I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU 4X

HEY SUDDENLY WE'RE STRANGERS
I WATCHED YOU WALKING AWAY
SHE WAS MY ONE TEMPTATION
I DID NOT WANT HER TO STAY
DEEP DOWN I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT YOU
OH YES I AM BABE ..... I FEEL SO IN LOVE
I FEEL SO IN LOVE OH BABE ..... WHAT CAN I DO

I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU 8X
GOT YOU ON MY MIND

HEY HEY WHAT GOOD IS BEING HERE
WITHOUT YOU I WANT TO KNOW
I FEEL SO IN LOVE OH BABE ..... WHAT CAN I DO

I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU 3X

CAN'T GET YOU OFF MY MIND
YOU'RE WITH ME BABE ALL THE TIME

THINKING ABOUT YOU 2X

ON MY MIND .... THINKING ABOUT YOU
