I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU -H.Williams-
                 (Hank Williams)


TO-DAY I PASSED YOU ON THE STREET 
AND MY HEART FELL AT YOUR FEET
I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU
SOMEBODY ELSE STOOD BY YOUR SIDE
AND HE LOOKED SO SATISFIED
I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU

	A PICTURE FROM THE PAST CAME SLOWLY STEALIN'
	AS I BRUSHED YOUR ARM AND WALKED SO CLOSE T0 YOU 	WHEN SUDDENLY I GOT THAT OLD TIME FEELIN'
	I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU

SOLO

	IT 'S HARD TO KNOW THAT OTHER LIPS WILL KISS YOU
	AND HOLD YOU JUST THE WAY I USED TO DO
	OH HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS HOW MUCH I MISS YOU
	I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU

	I CAN'T HELP IT IF I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU
