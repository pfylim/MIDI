  I'M GONNA LOVE YOU LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW
             FLACO JIMMINEZ

FOR SIX LONG YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THIS PRISON
LIVIN' MY LIFE BEHIND BARS  IN THIS DIRTY CELL
TO-MORROW THEY'RE GONNA TAKE
ME DOWN TO HUNT-A VILLE
TO SEND MY THOUGHTS TO HEAVEN OR TO HELL

I'M GONNA LOVE YOU LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW
I'M GONNA LOVE YOU LIKE  THERE'S NO YESTERDAY
I'M GONNA HUG AND KISS AWAY YOU'RE SORROW
I'M GONNA LOVE YOU LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW

AND THE WARDER SAID MY LAST REQUEST WAS GRANTED
YOU COULD COME AND STAY WITH ME TONIGHT
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO EVER BELIEVED IN ME
SO HOLD ME IN YOU'RE ARMS HOLD ME TIGHT

REFR.

SOLO

I KNOW MY LIFE WILL SOON BE OVER
AND THE LIFE OF OUR BAYCHILD HAS JUST BEGUN
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING NOW THAT'S LEFT TO HAUNT ME
TO THINK THAT WHAT I'VE LOST I MIGHT HAVE WON

REFR.
