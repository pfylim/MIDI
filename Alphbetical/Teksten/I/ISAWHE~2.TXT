*** I SAW HER STANDING THERE * BEATLES * *WP81

WELL SHE WAS JUST SEVENTEEN
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
AND THE WAY SHE LOOKED WAS WAY BEYOUND COMPARE
SO HOW COULD I DANCE WITH ANOTHER OH
WHEN I SAW HER STANDING THERE

WELL SHE LOOKED AT ME
AND I  I COULD SEE
THAT BEFORE TOO LONG
I'D FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
SHE WOULD'NT DANCE WITH ANOTHER OH
WHEN I SAW HER STANDING THERE

WELL MY HEART WENT BOOM
WHERN I CROSSED THAT ROOM
AND I HELD HER HAND IN MINE

WELL WE DANCED THROUGH THE NIGHT
AND WE HELD EACH OTHER TIGHT
AND BEFORE TOO LONG I FELL IN LOVE WITH MER
NOW I'LL NEVER DANCE WITH ANOTHER OH
SINCE I SAW HER STANDING THERE
