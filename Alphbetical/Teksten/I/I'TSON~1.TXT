   I'TS ONLY NATURAL  
ICE WILL MELT,WATER WILL BOIL
YOU AND I,SHAKE OFF THIS MORTAL COIL
I'TS BIGGER THEN US
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT

READY OR NOT,HERE COMES THE DROP
YOU FEEL LUCKY WHEN YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE
YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA COME TRUE
HERE IN YOUR ARMS I REMEMBER

IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT I SHOULD WANT TO BE THERE WITH YOU
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
THAT YOU SHOULD FEEL THE SME WAY TOO

IT'S EASY WHEN YOU DON'T TRY /
GOING ON FIRST,IMPRESSION MAN IN A CAGE
HAS MADE HIS CONFESSIONS NOW
YOU'VE SEEN ME AT MY WORST
AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST TIME I'M DOWN THERE

I WANT TO KNOW I FEEL COMPLETELY AT EASE
READ ME LIKE A BOOK
THAT'S FALLEN DOWN BETWEEN YOUR KNEES PLEASE
LET ME HAVE MY WAY WITH YOU

REFR
IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL.IT'S NOTHING WRITTEN IN THE SKY
AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY

SHAKING LIKE MUD,BUILDINGS OF GLASS
SINK INTO THE BAY
THEY'LL BE UNDER THE ROCKS AGAIN
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY 
I KNOW YOU'RE AFRAID

REFR
IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL.IT'S SOMTHING I WAS BORN TO
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.CAN I HELP IT IF YOU WANT TO
