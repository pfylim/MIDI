I DONT WANNA DANCE
DANCE WITH MY BABY NO MORE
AND NEVER DO SOMETHING TO HURT YOU DON'T
OH BUT THE FEELING IS BAD
THE FEELING IS BAD

I LOVE YOURE PERSENALITY
OH BUT I DON'T WANT OUR LOVE ON SHOW
SOMETHIMES I THINK IT'S INCIDENTLY
GIRL AWAY YOU GO

WITH ALL OF THE GUY ON THE CORNER
OH BABY YOUR THE LATEST TRACK
OH YOU SEEM TO HAVE THEIR NUMBER
LOVE THEIR DANCING STILL

REFREIN
SOLO
REFREIN

BABY NOW THE PARTY IS OVER
FOR US NOW I'LL BE ON MY WAY
NOW THAT THE TINGS WICHS MOVE ME
ARE STANDING STILL

I KNOW IT'S ONLY SUPERSTISION
BABY BUT I WONT LOOK BACK
EVEN TROUGH I FEEL YOUR MUSIC
BABY THAT IS THAT
