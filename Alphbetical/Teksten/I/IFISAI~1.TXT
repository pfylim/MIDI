IF I SAID YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BEL. BROTHERS

IF I SAID YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY
WON'T YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME
IF I SWORE YOU WERE AN ANGEL
WOULD YOU TREAT ME LIKE THE DEVIL TONIGHT
IF I WAS DYING FIRST
WOULD YOU FLOW IN LOVE COME QAINST ME
IF I SAID YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY
WOULD YOU HOLD IT AGAINST ME 

NOW WE COULD TALK ALL NIGHT ABOUT THE WEATHER
COULD TELL YOU'BOUT MY FRIENDS, OUT ON THE COAST
I COULD ASK A LOT OF GRAZY QUESTIONS
OR ASK YOU WHAT I MEAN, WANNA KNOW

REFR.

NOW RAIN CAN FALL SO SOFT AGAINST THE WINDOW
SUN CAN SHINE SO TRIGHT UP IN THE SKY
NOW DADDY ALWAY'S TOLD ME, DON'T BE SMALL SON
HE SAID COME ON OUT AND SAY WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND

REFR.
