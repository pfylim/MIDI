


          I SAW HER STANDING  THERE   THE BEATLES

WE'LL SHE WAS JUST SEVENTEEN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I  MEAN,
AND THE WAY SHE LOOKED,
WAS BEYOND COMPARE
SO HOW COULD I DANCE WITH ANOTHER,
OOOH, WHEN I SAW HER STANDING THERE

WELL SHE LOOKED AT ME,
AND I COULD SEE,
THAT BEFORE TOO LONG,
I'D FALL IN LOVE WITH HER,
SHE WOULDN'T DANCE WITH ANOTHER,
OH WHEN I SAW HER STANDING THERE

WELL MY HEART WENT ZOOM,
WHEN I CROSSED THAT ROOM,
AND I HELD HER HAND IN MINE........

OH WE DANCED THROUGH THE NIGHT,
AND HELD EACH OTHER TIGHT,
AND BEFORE TO LONG,
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
NOW I'LL NEVER DANCE WITH ANOTHER,
OH SINCE I SAW HER STANDING THERE

SOLO

WELL MY HEART ENZ.
