I SHOT THE SHERIFF                  - ERIC CLAPTON -
                   (Bob Marley)1974

	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, BUT I DIDN'T SHOOT NO DEPUTY,OH NO
	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, BUT I DIDN'T SHOOT NO DEPUTY,OOHOOHOOH

ALL AROUND IN MY HOME TOWN  THEY 'RE TRYING TO TRACK ME DOWN
THEY SAY THEY WANT TO BRING ME IN GUILTY
FOR THE KILLING OF A DEPUTY, FOR THE LIFE OF A DEPUTY

	(BUT I SAY)
	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, BUT I SWEAR IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENCE
	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, AND THEY SAY IT IS A CAPITAL OFFENCE

SHERIFF JOHN BROWN ALWAYS HATED ME, FOR WHAT I DO NOT KNOW
EVERY TIME I PLANT A SEED, HE SAID KILL IT BEFORE IT GROW
HE SAID KILL THEM BEFORE THEY GROW

	(READ IT IN THE NEWS)
	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, BUT I SWEAR IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENCE
	(WHERE WAS THE DEPUTY)
	I SHOT THE SHERIFF, (BUT I SWEAR IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENCE)

FREEDOM COME MY WAY ONE DAY, AND I STARTED OUT OF TOWN, YEAH
ALL OF A SUDDEN I SAW SHERIFF JOHN BROWN, AIMING TO SHOOT ME DOWN
SO I SHOT - ISHOT HIM DOWN AND I SAY, IF I 'M GUILTY I WILL PAY

REFLEXES HAD GOT THE BETTER OF ME, AND WHAT IS TO BE MUST BE
EVERY DAY THE BUCKET A GO A WELL, ONE DAY THE BUCKET A GO DROP OUT 
ONE DAY THE BUCKET A GO DROP OUT
