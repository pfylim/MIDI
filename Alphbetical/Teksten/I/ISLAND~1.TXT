                  ISLAND OF DREAMS

I WANDER THE STREETS AND THE GAY CROWDED PLACES
TRYIN' TO FORGET  YOU, BUT SOMEHOW IT SEEMS
MY THOUGHTS EVER STRAY
TO OUR LAST, SWEET EM-BRA-CES
OVER THE SEA , ON THE ISLAND OF DREAMS

HIGH IN THE SKY, IS A BIRD ON THE WING
PLEASE CAR-RY ME WITH YOU
FAR FAR AWAY, FROM THE MAD RUSHING CROWD
PLEASE CAR-RY ME WITH YOU

AGAIN I WOULD WANDER WHERE MEM-RIES ENFOLD ME
THERE ON THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND OF DREAMS

SOLO

HIGH IN THE SKY ENZ
