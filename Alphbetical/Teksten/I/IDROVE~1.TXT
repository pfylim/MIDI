      I HAD TO ESCAPE, THE CITY WAS STICKY AND CRUEL
      MAY BE I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU FIRST
      BUT I WAS DYIN' TO GET TO YOU    
      I WAS DREAMING WHILE I DROVE THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD AHEAD, 
      UH-HUH....YEAH  


      I COULD TASTE YOUR SWEET KISSES, YOUR ARMS OPEN WIDE, 
      THIS FEVER FOR YOU IS JUST BURNING ME UP INSIDE


      I DROVE ALL NIGHT TO GET TO YOU, IS THAT ALRIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT, 'CREPT IN YOUR ROOM 
      BROKE IN ON YOUR SLEEP TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU
      IS THAT ALRIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT


      WHAT IN THIS WORLD  KEEPS US FROM FALLING APART
      NO MATTER WHERE I GO I HEAR THE BEATING OF OUR ONE HEART
      I THINK ABOUT YOU WHEN THE NIGHT IS COLD AND DARK 
      UH HUH... YEAH   


      NO ONE CAN MOVE ME THE WAY THAT YOU DO
      NOTHING ERASES THIS  FEELING BETWEEN ME AN' YOU


      I DROVE ALL NIGHT TO GET TO YOU, IS THAT ALRIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT, 'CREPT IN YOUR ROOM 
      BROKE IN ON YOUR SLEEP TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU
      IS THAT ALRIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT


      I COULD TASTE YOUR SWEET KISSES, YOUR ARMS OPEN WIDE
      THIS FEVER FOR YOU IS JUST BURNING ME UP INSIDE


      I DROVE ALL NIGHT TO GET TO YOU
      IS THAT ALRIGHT, I DROVE ALL NIGHT
      'CREPT IN YOUR ROOM
      IS THAT ALRIGHT, I DROVE ALL NIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT TO GET TO YOU
      IS THAT ALRIGHT
      'CREPT IN YOUR ROOM
      IS THAT ALRIGHT
      I DROVE ALL NIGHT!
