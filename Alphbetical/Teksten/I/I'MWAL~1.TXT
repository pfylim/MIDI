           I'M WALKING    FATS DOMINO

I'M WALKING YES INDEED
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU AND ME
I WAS HOPIN' THAT YOU'LL COME BACK TO ME

YES I'M LONELEY AS I CAN BE
I'M WAITING FOR YOUR COMPANY
I'M HOPING THAT YOU COME BACK TO ME

WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WHEN THE WELLS RUNS DRY
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA RUN AND HIDE
I'M GONNA RUN RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE
FOR YOU'E PRETTY BABY I'LL EVEN DIE

I'M WALKING YES INDEED
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU AND ME
I WAS HOPIN' THAT YOU'LL COME BACK TO ME

SOLO

WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WHEN THE WELL WAS RUN
YOU'RE GONNA SIT RIGHT DOWN AND CRY
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO WHEN I SAY BEY BEY
ALL YOU'RE GONNA DO IS DRY YOU'RE EYES

I'M WALKING ENZ.
