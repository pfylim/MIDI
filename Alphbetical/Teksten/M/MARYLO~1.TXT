       HELLO MARY LOU    (Gene Pitney)


HELLO MARY LOU, GOODBYE HEART
SWEET MARY LOU I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU
I KNEW MARY LOU, WE 'D NEVER PART
SO HELLO MARY LOU, GOOD BYE HEART



YOU PASSED ME BY ONE SUNNY DAY
FLASHED THOSE BIG BROWN EYES MY WAY
AND OO I WANTED YOU FOREVER MORE
NOW I'M NOT ONE THAT GETS AROUND
I SWEAR MY FEET STUCK TO THE GROUND
AND THOUGH I NEVER DID MEET YOU BEFORE

(I SAID)


I SAW YOUR LIPS I HEARD YOUR VOICE
BELIEVE ME I JUST HAD NO CHOICE
WILD HORSES COULDN'T MAKE ME STAY AWAY
I THOUGHT ABOUT A MOONLIT NIGHT
MY ARMS AROUND YOU GOOD AND TIGHT
THAT 'S ALL I HAD TO SEE FOR ME TO SAY
