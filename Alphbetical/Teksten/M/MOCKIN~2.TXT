        MOCKING BIRD HILL    (Vaughn Horton)


WHEN THE SUN IN THE MORNIN' PEEPS OVER THE HILL
AND KISSES THE ROSES 'ROUND MY WINDOW SILL
THEN MY HEART FILLS WITH GLADNESS
WHEN I HEAR THE TRILL
OF THE BIRDS IN THE TREETOPS ON MOCKIN' BIRD HILL

TRALALA TWITTLEDEEDEEDEE, IT GIVES ME A THRILL
TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNIN' TO THE MOCKIN' BIRDS TRILL
TRALALA, TWITTLE DEEDEEDEE,   THERE 'S PEACE AND GOOD WILL
OU'RE WELCOME AS THE FLOWERS ON MOCKIN' BIRD HILL

GOT A THREECORNERED PLOW AND AN ACRE TO TILL
AND A MULE THAT I BOUGHT FOR A TEN DOLLAR BILL
THERE'S A TUMBLEDOWN SHACK AND A RUSTY OL' MILL
BUT IT'S MY HOME SWEET HOME UP ON MOCKIN' BIRD HILL.


WHEN IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING I CLIMB UP THE HILL
AND SURVEY ALL MY KINGDOM WHILE EVERYTHING'S STILL
ONLY ME AND THE SKY AND AN OL' WHIPPOORWILL
SINGIN' SONGS IN THE TWILIGHT ON MOCKIN' BIRD HILL
