*** RUBY THUESDAY  * ROD STUARD * * C * WP120

SHE WOULD NEVER SAY WHERE SHE CAME FROM
YESTERDAY DON'T MATTER IF IT'S GONE
WHY THE SUN IS BRIGHT
OR IN THE DARKEST NIGHT
NOBODY KNOWS, SHE COMES AND GOES
------------------------------------
GOODBEY RUBY THUESDAY              *
WHO COULD HANG A NAME ON YOU       *REFREIN 
WHEN YOU CHANGE WITH EVERY NEW DAY *
STILL GONNA MISS YOU               *
------------------------------------
DON'T QUESTION WHY SHE NEEDS TO BE SO FREE
SHE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO BE
SHE JUST CAN'T BE CHAIN
TO LIFE WHER'S NOTHINGS GATE
AND NOTHING'S LOST...THAT'S SUCH A COST

REFREIN

THERE'S NO TIME TO LOOSE A HEARD HER SAY
QUESS YOUR DREAMS BEFORE THEY SLIP AWAY
DYING ALL THE TIME
LOOSE YOUR DREAMS AND YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MIND
AND LOVE ON TIME

GOODBEY RUBY THUESDAY
GOODBEY RUBY THUESDAY
STILL GONNA MISS YOU

REFREIN
