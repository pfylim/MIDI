*** RIP IT UP ** BUDDY HOLLY *** A * WP38

WELL IT'S SATERDAY NIGHT AND I JUST GOT PAID
FOOL ABOUT MY MONEY DON'T TRY TO SAY
MY HEART SAYS GO GO HAVE A TIME
'CAUSE IT'S SATERDAY NIGHT AND I FEEL FINE
GONNA ROCK IT UP
GONNA RIP IT UP
GONNA SHAKE IT UP
GONNA BOLD IT UP
GONNA ROCK IT UP
HAVE A BALL TONIGHT
WELL ALONG BY TEN , I'LL BE FLYING HIGH
AND JUST WALK OUT AND THROUGH THE SKY
I DON'T CARE IF I SPIN MY DOOR
'CAUSE IT'S SATERDAY NIGHT AND I HAVE IT SO
GONNA ROCK IT UP
GONNA RIP IT UP
GONNA SHAKE IT UP
GONNA BOLD IT UP
GONNA ROCK IT UP
HAVE A BALL TONIGHT

Oooooh

WELL ALONG BY TEN I'LL BE FLYING HIGH
AND JUST WALK OUT AND THROUGH THE SKY
I DON'T CARE IF I SPIN MY DOOR
'CAUSE IT'S SATERDAY NIGHT AND I HAVE IT SO
GONNA ROCK IT UP
GONNA RIP IT UP
GONNA SHAKE IT UP
GONNA BOLD IT UP
GONNA ROCK IT UP HAVE A BALL TONIGHT
