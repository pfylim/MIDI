LAYLA                       - DEREK & THE DOMINOS -
       (E.Clapton/J.Gordon)1972

WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN YOU GET LONELY
WITH NOBODY WAITING BY YOUR SIDE
YOU 'VE BEEN RUNNING AND HIDING MUCH TOO LONG
YOU KNOW IT 'S JUST YOUR FOOLISH PRIDE

	LAYLA, YOU GOT ME ON MY KNEES
	LAYLA, I 'M BEGGING DARLING PLEASE
	LAYLA, DARLING WON'T YOU EASE MY WORRIED MIND

TRIED TO GIVE YOU CONSOLATION
YOUR OLD MAN WON'T LET YOU DOWN
LIKE A FOOL I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
TURNED THE WHOLE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN

LET 'S MAKE THE BEST OF THE SITUATION
BEFORE I FINALLY GO INSANE
PLEASE DON'T SAY WE 'LL NEVER FIND A WAY
AND TELL ME ALL MY LOVE 'S IN VAIN
