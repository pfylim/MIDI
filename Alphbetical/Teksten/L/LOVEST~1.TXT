Lovesick blues               From   Nashville   Vol 1

I got a feelin' called the blues oh
Since I don't know what I
All I do is sit and
Oh Lord the last long day she said
Alone I prought I would
She'll do me she'll do
She's got that kind of love
Lord I love to her sweet daddydaddy dad

Such a beautiful day
I hate to think it's all over
I lost my heart it
I've grown so used to you some
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy
And I'm lonesome
I got the lovesick

Well I'm in love in love
That's what the matter
Well I'm in love I'm in love with a but she don't
Lord I tried and I tried to keep her
But she gust would
Though now that she is leaving this is all I can
