  LOOSING MY RELIGION     R.E.M

OH LIFE, IT'S BIGGER,
IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU, AND YOU ARE NOT ME
THE LENGTHS THAT I WILL GO TO
THE DISTANCE IN YOUR EYES
OH NO I'VE SAID TOO MUCH, I SET IT UP

THAT'S ME IN THE CORNER
THAT'S ME IN THE SPOT-LIGHT LOSING MY RELIGION
TRYIN TO KEEP UP WITH YOU
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT
OH NO I'VE SAID TOO MUCH
I HAVEN'T -SAID ENOUGH

I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD YOU LAUGHING
I THOUGHT THAT I HEARD YOU SING
I THINK I THOUGHT I SAW YOU TRY

EVERY WHISPER,OF EVERY WAKING HOUR
I'M CHOOSING MY CONFESSIONS
TRYING TO KEEP , EYE ON YOU
LIKE A HURT LOST AND BLINDED FOOL
OH NO I'VE SAID TOO MUCH, I SET IT UP

CONSIDER THIS, CONSIDER THIS, HINTS OF THE CENTURY
CONSIDER THIS, THE SLIP, THAT BROUGHT ME TO MY KNEES
FAILED THAT IF WE ALL THESE FANTASIES
COME FAILING AROUND, NOW I'VE SAID, TOO MUCH

REFR.

SOLO 2X

BUT THAT WAS JUST A DREAM, THAT WAS JUST A DREAM

THAT'S ME IN THE CORNER ENZ.
REFREIN

BUT THAT WAS JUST A DREAM, TRY CRY WHY TRY
THAT WAS JUST A DREAM JUST A DREAM JUST A DREAM
