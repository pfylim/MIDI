LISTEN TO THE MUSIC      - DOOBIE BROTHERS -
                  (Tom Johnston)

DON'T YOU FEEL IT GROWIN' DAY BY DAY
PEOPLE GETTIN' READY FOR THE NEWS
SOME ARE HAPPY, SOME ARE SAD
OH, WE GOT TO LET THE MUSIC PLAY
WHAT THE PEOPLE NEED IS A WAY TO MAKE 'EM SMILE
IT AIN'T SO HARD TO DO, IF YOU KNOW HOW
GOTTA GET A MESSAGE, GET IT ON, THROUGH
OH, NOW MAMA 'S GOIN' TO AFTER WHILE

	OH, OH, OH, LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
	OH, OH, OH, LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
	OH, OH, OH, LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
	ALL THE TIME

LIKE A LAZY FLOWING RIVER, SURROUNDING CASTLES IN THE SKY
AND THE CROWD IS GROWING BIGGER
LIST'NIN' FOR THE HAPPY SOUNDS
AND I GOT TO LET THEM FLY

WELL I KNOW YOU BETTER, EVERYTHING I SAY
MEET ME IN THE COUNTRY FOR A DAY
WE 'LL BE HAPPY AND WE 'LL DANCE
OH, WE 'RE GONNA DANCE OUR BLUES AWAY
AND IF I 'M FEELIN' GOOD TO YOU
AND YOU 'RE FEELIN' GOOD TO ME
THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' WE CAN'T DO OR SAY
FEELIN' GOOD, FEELIN' FINE
OH, BABY LET THE MUSIC PLAY
