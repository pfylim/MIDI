     ***** LOLA ****  THE KINKS ** E ** 11-06-1991

I MET HER IN A CLUB, DOWN IN OLD SOHO.
WHERE YOU DRINK CHAMPAGNE AND IT TASTES JUST LIKE
CHERRY COLA - SEE OH EL AYE COLA.
SHE WALKED UP TO ME,AND SHE ASKED ME TO DANCE,
I ASKED HERE NAME,AND IN A DARK BROWN VOICE,
SHE SAID LOLA - EL OH EL AYE LOLA- LA-LA-LA-LA-LOLA.

WELL I'M NOT THE WORLD'S MOST PHYSICAL GUY,
BUT WHEN SHE SQUEEZED ME TIGHT SHE NEARLY BROKE,
MY SPINE - OH MY LOLA  LA LA LA LA LOLA.
WELL I'M NOT DUMB,BUT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,
WHY SHE WALK LIKE A WOMAN AND TALK LIKE A MAN,
OH MY LOLA - LA LA LA LA LOLA -LA LA LA LA LOLA.
----------------------
WELL WE DRINK CHAMPAGNE AND DANCE ALL NIGHT.
UNDER ELECTRIC CANDIELIGHT.
SHE PICKED ME UP AND SAT ME ON HER KNEE,
AND SAID,"DEAR BOY,WON'T YOU COME HOME WITH ME".
WELL I'M NOT THE WORLD'S MOST PASSIONATE GUY.
BUT WHEN I LOOKED IN HER EYES,WELL I ALMOST FELL FOR MY
LOLA-LA LA LA LA LOLA-LA LA LA LA LOLA.
-----------------------
I PUSHED HER AWAY - I WALKED TO THE DOOR.
I FELL TO THE FLOOR - I GOT DOWN ON MY KNEES.
THEN I LOOKED AT HER
WELL THAT'S THE WAY THAT I WANT IT TO STAY,
AND I ALWAYS WANT IT TO BE THAT WAY ,
FOR MY LOLA - LA LA LA LA LOLA

GIRLS WILL BE BOY'S,AND BOYS WILL BE GIRLS,
IT'S A MIXED UP,MUDDLED UP,SHOOK UP WORLD EXCEPT,
FOR LOLA - LA LA LA LA LOLA.
WELL I LEFT HOME JUST A WEEK BEFORE,
AND I'D NEVER EVER KISSED A WOMAN BEFORE.
BUT LOLA SMILED AND TOOK MY BY THE HAND,
AND SAID " DEAR BOY I'M GONNA MAKE YOU A MAN".
WELL I'M NOT THE WORLD'S MOST MASCULINE MAN.
BUT I KNOW WHAT I AM,AND I'M GLAD I'M A MAN,AND SO IS.
