           ***THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND*****

THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND.  THIS LAND IS MY LAND.
FROM CALIFORNIA TO THE NEW YORK ISLAND.
FROM THE REDWOOD FOREST,TO THE GOLFSTREAM WATER.
THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.

I ROAMEND AN RAMBLED,AND I FOLOWED MY FOOTSTEPS.
TO THE SPARKLIN SAND OF,HER DIAMOND DESERTS.
AND ALL AROUND ME,A VOICE WAS SINGING.
THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.

AS I WENT WALKING,THAT RIVER NORTH HIGHWAY.
I SAW ABOVE ME,THAT ENDLES SKYWAY.
I SAW BELOW ME,THOSE GOLDEN VALLEYS.
THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.

AS THE SUN WAS SHINING,AND I WAS STROLLIN.
AND THE WHEATFIELDS WAVING,AND THE DUST HAERT ROLLIN
AS THE GROWD WAS LIFTIN,A VOICE WAS SAYIN.
THIS LAND WAS MADE FOR YOU,THIS LAND IS MADE FOR ME
THIS LAND IS MADE FOR YOU AND ME.
