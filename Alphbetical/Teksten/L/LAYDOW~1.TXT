
   ****** LAY DOWN SALLY ***** ERIC CLAPTON ** A **


THERE IS NOTHING, THAT IS  WRONG.  
IN WANTING YOU TO STAY HERE WITH ME.
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT SOMEWHERE TO GO.
BUT WON'T YOU MAKE YOUR SELF AT HOME, AND STAY WITH ME.
AND DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE.

     ----------------------------
LAY DOWN SALLY,AND REST YOU IN MY ARMS.
DON'T YOU THINK YOU WANT SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
LAY DOWN SALLY, NO NEED TO LEAVE SO SOON.
I'VE BEEN TRYING ALL NIGHT LONG,JUST TO TALK TO YOU.

     ----------------------------
THE SUN AIN'T NEARLY ON THE RISE.
WE STILL GOT THE MOON AND STARS ABOVE.
UNDER-NEATH THE VELVET SKIES.
LOVE IS ALL THAT MATERS,WON'T YOU STAY WITH ME.
AND DON'T YOU EVER LEAVE.

REFREIN - SOLO

I LONG TO SEE THE MORNING LIGHT.
COLOURING YOUR FACE SO DREAMILY.
SO DON'T YOU GO AND SAY GOODBYE.
YOU CAN LAY YOUR WORRIES DOWN, AND STAY WITH ME.
AND DONT YOU EVER LEAVE.

REFREIN 2 MAAL.
