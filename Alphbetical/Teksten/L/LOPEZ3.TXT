 TRINI LOPEZ SERIE ( 3 ) toon G

         ****** LEMMON TREE ****

WHEN I WAS JUST A YEAR OF TEN,
MY FATHER SAID TO ME.
COME HERE AND TAKE A LESSON FROM,
A LOVELY LEMMON TREE.
COME PUT YOUR FAIT IN LOVE MY BOY,
MY FATHER SAID TO ME.
THE FEAR YOU FIND THAT LOVE IS LIKE,
A LOVELY LYEMMON TREE.

LEMMON TREE IS VERY PRETTY               :
AND THE LEMMON FLOWER IS SWEET           :___2 X
BUT THAT FRUIT OF THAT POOR LEMMON       :
IS IMPOSIBLE TO EAT                      :

BETWEEN THAT LEMMON TREE ONE DAY,
MY LOVE AND I DID LAY.
THE GIRL SO SWEET THAT WHEN SHE SMILL,
THE STARS GROWS IN THE SKY.
WE PASSED THE SUMMER LOST IN LOVE,
BETWEEN THAT LEMMON TREE,
THE MUSIC OF HER LEFTER HIT,
MY FATHERS WORDS FOR ME,

REFREIN 2 X

ONE DAY SHE LEFT WITHOUT ONE WORD,
SHE TOOK AWAY THE SUN.
AND IN THE DARK SHE LEFT BEHIND,
UNKNEW WHAT SHE HAS DONE.
SHE LEFT ME FOR ANOTHER,
IT GOMES AND TEAL BY TRUE.
SHE SET UP TEAT MY WIFE'S OR KNOW,
I SING THIS SONG FOR YOU.

REFREIN 2 X
