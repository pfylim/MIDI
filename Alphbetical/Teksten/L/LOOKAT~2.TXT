WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU
WHEN YOU'VE BROKEN TOO MANY PEOPLES HEART'S
AND CAN'T FIND ANYONE NEW

'BOUT THAT TWINKLE IN YOUR EYE
IS THAT TWINKLE IN YOUR EYE MEANT FOR ME
OR MEANT FOR SOME OTHER GUY

LOOK AT ME FROM NOW ON

LOOK AT ME FROM NOW ONE
LET ME KNOW YOU CARE

HEY HEY LOOK AT ME AND TELL ME
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU
WHEN YOU'VE SPOKEN SWEET WORDS OF LOVE TO ME
AND I WANT TO MARRY YOU
