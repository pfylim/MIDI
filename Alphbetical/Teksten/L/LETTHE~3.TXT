
                     LET THE BEAT GO ON 


    choosing BPM is a big problem 2x

    a lot of people get hurt just for nothing 
    due to inability to make their mind 
    make up your mind before it gets too late 
    action  speaks just louder that voice 
    if you haven't got one then ask the doctor 
    just ring ring ring call I on the phone 
    self-confidence is the key to choose 

    chorus 
    let the beat go on holding on getting strong 
    let the beat go on 
    
    the youth nowadays have difficulties in choosing 2x

    that's why we old have to help them out 
    before they left them job and turn a gun-man 
    before they left them job and turn a hooligan 
    say mi love part 1
    but mi prefer part2
    when mi play them 33
    say mi keep them alive 
    when mi play them 43  
    say they rock and come one 
    self-confidence 
    is the key to choose 
    self-confidence 
    is the key to choose 

    chorus.....
