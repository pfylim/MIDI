     BUT I DO     CLARENCE,FROGMAN HENRY

I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU, BUT I  DO
I DON'T KNOW WHY I CRY SO, BUT I DO
I ONLY KNOW I'M LONELEY
AND THAT I WANT YOU ONLY
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU, BUT I DO

I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT BECAUSE I FEEL SO RESTLESS
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I FEEL SO HELPLESS
AND SINCE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
I CRY BOTH NIGHT AND DAY
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU, BUT I DO

   MY DAY'S HAVE BEEN SO LONELEY
   MY NIGHT'S HAVE BEEN SO BLUE
   I DON'T KNOW, HOW I STAND IT, BUT I DO

EACH NIGHT I SIT ALONE, AND TELL MYSELF
THAT I WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH, SOMEONE ELSE
I GUESS I'M WAISTIN' TIME
BUT I'VE GOT TO CLEAR MY MIND
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LOVE YOU, BUT I DO

SOLO

VANAF/   MY DAY'S HAVE BEEN SO LONELEY
