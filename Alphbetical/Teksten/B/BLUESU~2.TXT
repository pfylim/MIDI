                  Blue suede shoes          Elvis Presley 


Well it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready , now go cat go

	But don't you
	Step on my blue suede shoes
	You can do anything but  
	Lay off of my blue suede shoes

Well , you can knock me down , step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do	
But uh-uh honey lay off of my shoes

Well , you can burn my house , steal my car
Drink my liquor from my old fruit jar
Do anything that you wanna do	
But uh-uh honey lay off of my shoes
