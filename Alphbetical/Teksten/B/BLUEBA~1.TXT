                 BLUE BAYOU    DIV. ARTIESTEN.

I  FEEL SO BAD I GOT A WORRIED MIND
I'M SO LONELEY ALL THE TIME,
SINCE I LEFT MY BABY BEHIND
ON BLUE BAYOU

WANT TO SEE MY BABY AGAIN,
AND TO BE WITH SOME OF MY FRIENDS,
MAYBE I'LL BE HAPPIER THEN,
ON BLUE BAYOU

I'M GOING BACK SOMEDAY, COME WHAT MAY
TO BLUE BAYOU
WHERE YOU SLEEP ALL DAY AND THE CATFISH PLAY
ON BLUE BAYOU
AND THE FISHING BOATS, WITH THE SAILS A FLOAT
IF I, COULD ONLY SEE
THAT FAMILIAR SUNRICE THROUGH SLEEPY EYES,
HOW HAPPY I'D BE

I FEEL SO BAD I GOT A WORRIED MIND,
I'M SO LONELEY ALL THE TIME,
SINCE I LEFT MY BABY BEHIND ON BLUE BAYOU
SAVING NICKLES SAVING DIMES,
WORKINGTILL THE SUN DON'T SHINE,
LOOKING FORWARD TO HAPPIER TIMES ON BLUE BAYOU

I'M GOING BACK SOME DAY GONNA STAY ON BLUE BAYOU
WHERE MY FOLKS I'LL FIND ALL THE TIME ON BLUE BAYOU
WITH THAT GIRL OF MINE BY MY SIDE
TILL THE MOON IN THE EVENING DIES
OH SOME SWEET DAY GONNA TAKE AWAY
THIS HURTIN' INSIDE
