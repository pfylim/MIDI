       BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO NEIL SEDAKA

CAME CAME DAM ENZ.  3 X

DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE AWAY FROM ME
DON'T YOU LEAVE MY HEART IN MISERY
IF YOU GO THEN I'LL BE BLUE
CAUSE BREAKING UP IT'S HARD TO DO

REMEMBER WHEN YOU HELD ME TIGHT
AND YOU KISSED ME ALL THRU NIGHT
THINK OF ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN THRU
AND BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO

THEY SAY THAT BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO
NOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE
DON'T SAY THAT THIS IS THE END
INSTEAD OF BREAKING UP IS WISH
THAT WE WERE MAKING UP AGAIN

I BEG OF YOU DON'T SAY GOODBEY
CAN'T WE GIVE OUR LOVE ANOTHER TRY
COME ON BABY LET'S START A-NEW
CAUSE BREAKING UP IT'S HARD TO DO

REFR.
LAATSTE COUPLET
